2,2,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an Ohio resident and his Pennsylvania business partner in connection with an unregistered and fraudulent binary options business.

According to the SEC's complaint, Jared Jeffrey Davis and various shell companies controlled by Davis and his business partner, Dale Burke Pinchot, engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered binary option securities under the brand names OptionMint, OptionKing, Option Queen, and OptionPrince. According to the complaint, Davis misrepresented the number of investors who successfully traded binary options and failed to disclose that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of trades. The complaint alleges that Davis, Pinchot, and their companies effectively took the opposing position on each trade and therefore made money when customers entered into losing binary options trades. The complaint further alleges that Davis failed to inform investors that he frequently manipulated the options trading software to increase the odds of investor losses.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio, charges Davis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and charges Pinchot with violating antifraud provision Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis and Pinchot consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any binary option security. The final judgments provide that the court will determine disgorgement and civil penalties at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio announced criminal charges against Davis on June 5, 2018.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by James Thibodeau and Justin Sutherland of the Commission's Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley. The litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."," 1  Amy J.

. DEFENDANT
S 10. Jared Jeffrey Davis
, born 1976
, is 
last known to be 
a resident of
 Sandusky, Ohio
. Davis and business partner
 Pinchot
 directly or indirectly 
owned multiple companies and internet 
websites that offered binary options securities trading to investors, and 
Davis
 served as the 
primary manager of the overall enterprise. 
  11. Dale Burke Pinchot
, born 1970
, is 
last known to be
 a res
ident of 
Yardley
, Pennsylvania, and was the partner of Davis in the 
binary options
 business
. STATEMENT OF 
FACTS
 A. Binary Options
 12. A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely 
on the outcome of a yes/no, or binary, 
proposition or event such as whether the price of a 
particular underlying asset (
e.g.
, an individual stock, an index of stocks, a currency, a 
commodity) will rise above or fall below a specified amount at a specified future point in time.
 13. Once the option i
s acquired
 by the investor
, there is 
typically 
no further decision 
for the 
investor
 to make regarding the exercise of the binary option because binary option
 Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  3 of 15.  PageID #: 3 4  contracts
 exercise automatically
 at expiration
. 14. Unlike 
some 
other types of options, binary option
 contracts
 do not give the holder 
the right to buy or sell the specified 
underlying 
asset. 
When the binary option expires, the option 
holder typically receives an amount (sometimes referred to as the ﬁpayoutﬂ) that is either a pre
-determined amount or a per
centage return based on initial investment (
i.e.
, the premium) or loses 
all or nearly all of his or her investment. For example, a binary option contract with Apple stock 

as its underlying asset might, on the question of whether or not the price of Apple s
tock will be 
above or below $X per share five minutes hence, offer investors terms of a 70% payout on a 

winning trade or a 100% loss of capital on a losing trade.
 15. Given this all
-or-nothing payout structure, binary option contracts are also 
sometimes referr
ed to as ﬁall
-or-nothing optionsﬂ or ﬁfixed
-return options.ﬂ
 16. Binary option contracts based on securities and securities
-based indices are 
themselves securities
 and thus are subject to the federal securities laws
. B. The 
Unregistered 
Binary Options 
Industry
 17. The unregistered 
binary options industry is 
often 
composed of three primary 
components
 sometimes referred to as
 ﬁplatforms,
ﬂ ﬁbrands,
ﬂ and 
ﬁaffiliate marketers.
ﬂ 18. Platforms, frequently based in Israel but sometimes based in other locations, such 
as Bulgaria, 
are, as the moniker implies, the foundation of the unregistered binary options 

industry. 
 19. Platforms offer services for a fee that other intermediaries, called brands 
(discussed below), purchase or license and that may include software related to (
a) trade 
entry 
and execution services, (
b) customer account and client relationship management (ﬁCRMﬂ), (
c) access to investment products (
i.e.
, various binary option contracts), and (
d) back office IT 
Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  4 of 15.  PageID #: 4 5  support. Some platforms 
also provide
 introductions to affiliate marketers (described below).
 20. Brands, also known in the 
unregistered binary options 
industry as ﬁprivate labels,ﬂ 
ﬁwhite labels,ﬂ or ﬁbrokers,ﬂ may be established with a relatively modest investment and 
typically operate under a 
trade name while contracting with a platform for trade, customer 

account, and back office systems and services.
 21. Generally, brand operators, such as 
the 
Defendants
, possess custody of customer 
funds, do not charge commissions on trades, and are the counterp
arty to each customer binary 
options transaction.
 22. Affiliate marketers are independent entities who produce sophisticated internet 
marketing campaigns centered on ephemeral websites and videos promoting the purportedly 

extraordinary and easy profits that ca
n be obtained through binary options trading (although 

some campaigns
 may
 not specifically mention binary options).
 23. These internet marketing campaigns, including those hired by 
Davis
, frequently 
employ false statements, false testimonials, and/or falsified
 trading results, created by the 
affiliate marketer, to lure potential victims in and to shepherd them, for a fee, to binary option 

brand websites such as those operated by 
the 
Defendants
. C. Economics of the Unregistered Binary Options Industry and Binary 
Option 
Brands
  24. The economic basis of the unregistered binary options industry 
as participated in 
by 
the 
Defendants 
is predicated upon the knowledge that, in the aggregate and utilizing 
sufficiently volatile underlying assets, investors are likely to win on
ly slightly more than 50% of 
their trades.
 25. By structuring binary option contracts such that investors will be credited, 
typically, with only a 70
-85% payout on winning trades and a 95
-100% loss of capital on losing 
Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  5 of 15.  PageID #: 5 6  trades, the binary options industry can r
ely on the almost equal distribution of trade outcomes 
(i.e.
, wins and losses) to, as with casinos, mathematically assure themselves of a profit over time.
 26. Brands
, such as those operated by 
the 
Defendants
, derive their revenue from being 
the counterparty t
o losing customer trades and retaining what is forfeited by customers thereby.
 In other words, binary option brands
, such as those operated by 
the 
Defendants
, have a 
keen
 interest in having their customers lose money through binary options trading.
 27. To bett
er ensure this profitable
 (to the brand)
 outcome, at least some platforms 
offered their brand customers access to software services or protocols, sometimes referred to as 
ﬁrisk management,ﬂ that would further 
increase
 the odds against 
investor 
customers
 of the 
brands
. 28. These risk management 
protocols
, applied at the platform level to investor 
account
s at the req
uest of the brand operator, act to increase the likelihood that a given 
customer™s binary option trades will ﬁloseﬂ (and the opposite can be done with the accounts of 
discouraged customers in order to induce them, via experiencing a limited number of winni
ng 
trades, to keep trading and/or to deposit additional funds into their binary options trading 

account). 
 29. Thus
, brands
, such as those operated by 
the 
Defendants
, in order 
to generate 
meaningful and ongoing revenue require three things: (
i) that customers 
actively trade their 
binary options accounts (
i.e.
, so that the effects of the math underlying the payout structure have 
an opportunity to apply); (
ii) that that trading is unsuccessful (
i.e.
, customers lose money to the 
brand via losing trades); and (
iii) that a constant stream of new customers is found to replace 
those who have either lost all of their investment capital or who have closed their account after 

discovering that binary options trading is unlikely to prove 
a profitable
 long
-term
 endeavor
.  Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  6 of 15.  PageID #: 6 7  D. The Defendant
s™ Binary Options Business
 30. During or before early 2012, 
the Defendants
 undertook steps, including the 
formation of various foreign shell companies with foreign bank accounts, to establish their first 
binary options brand, OptionMint (www.optionm
int.com).
 31. Over the next few years, 
the 
Defendants 
established an additional three brands
ŠOptionKing (www.optionking.com), Option
 Queen (www.optionqueen.com), and OptionPrince 
(www.optionprince.com)
Šadditional foreign shell companies with foreign bank accou
nts, and, 
operating at various times, three call centers 
(with employees
) located in Sandusky, Ohio
; Costa 
Rica
; and Sint Maarten.
 32. This binary options enterprise, referred to hereinafter as the 
ﬁEnterprise,
ﬂ although co
-owned by 
the 
Defendants
, was at all 
times primarily managed by D
avis
. 33. During the Relevant Period, t
he Enterprise accepted, as customers, investors 
located throughout the United States and around the world
 and offered and sold to them binary 
option contracts on individual stocks, stock 
indice
s, currencies, and commodities
 collecting at 
least $10 million (in aggregate) from them thereby
 of which the 
Defendants 
obtained a portion 
thereof
. 34. The offer and sale of binary option securities
 (i.e.
, those binary options based on 
securities and securitie
s-based indices)
 by 
the 
Defendants 
and the Enterprise was not registered 
with the Commission, and neither w
ere the 
Defendants 
or the Enterprise 
registered with the 
Commission as either a broker or a dealer
, and
 nor 
were the 
Defendants
 associated with a bro
ker 
or dealer
 registered with the Commission
. 35. In connection with the offer, purchase (by investors), and sale of binary 
option 
securities, D
avis
, directly or indirectly
 through the Enterprise, 
engaged in the making of 
Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  7 of 15.  PageID #: 7 8  misstatement
s of material fact or omi
tted
 to state material fact
s necessary in order to make the 
statements made not misleading
 and 
obtain
ed money or property
 from 
binary options securities 
investors thereby. 
For example
, Davis
 (a) 
in 
Enterprise 
marketing emails and/or in 
Enterprise
 telephone sales scripts 
used by
 Enterprise call center 
employees
 (both of which were approved 
by 
Davis
), misrepresented the number of successful 
binary option 
investors the
 Enterprise had
 and 
omitted 
the fact that, to be successful, an investor would need
 to win an unlikely 
high 
percentage
 of his or her trades, 
(b) misrepresented 
the security of investor funds
 which were, in 
fact, comingled with the general funds of the 
Enterprise
, (c) misrepresented 
the knowledge and 
experience of 
Enterprise
 employees
 who
 advised customers on binary options trading
, (d) 
misrepresented 
the
 Enterprise™s interest in seeing its customers succeed by omitting to disclose 
the
 basic fact that 
the Enterprise
, and thus the 
Defendants
, effectively 
took the opposing position 
on each t
rade and thus 
required customers to lose 
money via binary options trading 
in order for 
the Enterprise 
and the 
Defendants 
to make money
, and
 (e)
 failed to disclose
 that 
Davis
 and the 
Enterprise could and oftentimes 
would 
increase the odds
 against customer
 success
 via 
application of risk management protocols
. 36. Davis
 also engaged in misstatements and omissions in the 
Terms & Conditions
 section of the OptionMint
 website (which he controlled). For example, although this section 
contained a risk disclosure statement, it was silent on the ability of 
Davis
, via the Enterprise,
 to 
have risk management protocols applied to the accounts of winning customers. Similarly, 
although th
is section contained a disclosure that 
ﬁbonus money
ﬂ (an inducement, such as, for 
example, a matching $500 credit on a $500 deposit made in order to lure 
wavering
 prospective 
customers into opening and funding a binary options account)
 must be t
urned over 
(i.e.
, traded) 
30 times
 before it could be withdrawn by the customer
, it was silent on the fact that, 
Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  8 of 15.  PageID #: 8 9  mathematically, an investor was likely to lose all of his or her investment capital prior to 
achieving 
this turnover level. Finally, although t
his section discussed OptionMint™s 
ﬁknow-your
-customer
ﬂ policy and the supposed need for 
obtaining 
certain identifying documents
 from 
customers
, it was silent about the fact that 
Davis, via 
the Enterprise
, could and 
would use 
those
 documents against custom
ers 
who 
attempt
ed to effect
 a debit/credit card 
chargeback once they 
realized that they had been misinformed about the realities of binary option
s trading.
 37. Davis
 also, 
directly or indirectly
 through the Enterprise, 
engaged in
 a fraudulent 
scheme
. In addition to 
Davis
™s misrepresentations and omissions described above, D
avis
 also 
directed 
Enterprise employees
 to (
a) disseminate fake trading results to customers in an effort to 
get them to enter into binary option trades, (
b) have risk management pro
tocols applied to the 
accounts of ﬁwinningﬂ customer
s so that their subsequent trades would be less likely to win, and 
(c) ﬁburnﬂ 
certain 
customer accounts through excessive trading.
 38. Pinchot, as a business partner, financier
, and benefactor of the overall Enterprise, 
knew or should have known about the 
Enterprise™s operations and trading activities, including 

the 
misrepresentations and omissions described herein.

  Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  15 of 15.  PageID #: 15"
4,4,"On November 19, 2018, a U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered final judgments on consent against defendants Edward and Jean Chen, husband and wife, and five entity defendants who had been charged with defrauding Chinese investors in connection with the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program.

On September 20, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against Edward and Jean Chen, Home Paradise Investment Center LLC, GH Investment LP, GH Design Group LLC, Golden Galaxy LP, and Mega Home LLC, alleging that the Chens, through the entities they controlled, raised more than $22.5 million from 45 investors in China for the development of an interior design center and an 80-unit condominium building. The complaint alleged that the Chens misappropriated and misused more than $12 million of investors' funds by purchasing residential real estate unrelated to the two EB-5 projects. The SEC's complaint further alleged that the Chens and their companies provided investors a fake lease for the interior design center that replaced the name of the true lessor with a Chen-controlled entity and overstated the true size of the leased space five-fold.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments resolving all claims. The final judgments enjoin defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and further enjoin Edward and Jean Chen from participating in the offer or sale of any security which constitutes an investment in a ""commercial enterprise"" under the USCIS EB-5 visa program. The final judgments also order Edward and Jean Chen, GH Investment LP, GH Design Group LLC, Golden Galaxy LP, and Mega Home LLC to pay, on a joint and several basis, disgorgement of $24,655,000, with prejudgment interest of $1,173,098. The final judgments also order Edward and Jean Chen to pay civil penalties of $1,077,500 each. The disgorgement amount represents $22.5 million in capital contributions and $2.155 million in administrative fees the defendants received from the investors, and is subject to an offset for any amounts that may be distributed to the defrauded investors by the court-appointed receiver. Additionally, the final judgments order Home Paradise Investment Center LLC to pay, on a joint and several basis with the other defendants, disgorgement of $2.155 million, with prejudgment interest of $119,583, which has been deemed satisfied by amounts already collected and to be distributed to the investors by the receiver.","

6,6,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Mark Suleymanov of Glen Cove, New York with engaging in an online binary options scheme that defrauded retail investors out of approximately $4 million.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from at least 2012 to 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of binary options, which are securities that pay out depending on the outcome of a ""yes/no"" proposition, such as whether a specific equity security will close at or above a specified price on a given trading day. Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds. Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds. As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses. In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses.

The SEC's complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty. Suleymanov has agreed to a bifurcated settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from these provisions. The settlement, which is subject to Court approval, reserves the issues of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Shioji and supervised by Lisa Deitch, Cheryl Crumpton, and Antonia Chion. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office.

, which purported to sell 
educational materials that would supposedly improve an investor
™s performance, and 
AssetSignals.com, which purported to sell trading ﬁsignals,ﬂ or tips on market movements
, that 
would also 
supposedly improve investors™ trading results. 
Via these ﬁeducationalﬂ sites, 
Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 3 4  Suleymanov encouraged investors to make more trades on the SpotFN platform, 
which resulted 
in investors incurring 
more losses. 
 12. The SpotFN binary options were options contracts o
f short duration that
 wer
e based on 
the price of 
stocks and stock indexes, or other 
financial assets
. A binary option™s
 payout 
depended on the outcome of a ﬁyes/noﬂ proposition. For example, 
SpotFN offered and sold 

binary options in which a
n investor would choose whether a 
given stock™
s price would be above 
or below a 
specified 
price at a 
specified 
time. When the option expired, the investor would either 
earn a pre
-determined amount if he chose correctly, or he would earn nothing and forfeit
 the 
amount of his investment
 if he chose incorrectly
. Binary options are securities within the 
meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act when they take the form of options based on the 

value of a security or index of securities. 
 13. Investor funds were 
sent, either by wire or via credit card processors, into 
bank
 accounts 
that had been opened and were controlled by Suleymanov. 
Suleymanov 
received 
approximately
 $4 million
 in investor funds
 through these accounts
.  14. Suleymanov caused SpotFN™s
 website to falsely represent that SpotFN was a legitimate 
incorporated entity with officers and directors, when in fact, for most of its existence, it was not. 

Suleymanov also caused SpotFN™s website to misleadingly feature the NASDAQ logo, despite 

the fa
ct that SpotFN™s binary options were not traded on NASDAQ or any other regulated 

exchange. 
 Unregistered Offers and Sales of SpotFN Binary Options
 15. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e], it is unlawful for any person, 
directly or indirectl
y, to offer or sell securities using the U.S. mails or interstate commerce, 
unless (1) the offer or sale is registered with the SEC pursuant to a valid registration statement 
Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4 5  that applies to that specific offering; or (2) the offer or sale is specifically 
exempt from the 
registration requirements of Section 5. 
 16. No registration statement was filed or in effect as to the offer and sale of binary options 
through the SpotFN websites. In addition, no exemption from the registration requirement 
applied. 
Suleymanov directly sold the securities via SpotFN, creating and maintaining the 

websites through which the securities were offered and sold
. Suleymanov 
Made 
Material Misrepresentations
 and 
Engaged in a Fraudulent Scheme
  A. Suleymanov
 Misrepresented that Binary Options Trading Would Be Profitable
  17. On the SpotFN websites, 
Suleymanov
 made false statements about 
the significant and 
sustainable profits that investors could expect from trading binary options using SpotFN™s 

platform
, and about SpotFN™s motivation to have clients™ trading be successful
. For example, the 
SpotFN.com 
website stated
:   ﬁUp to 88% Return.ﬂ 
  ﬁ[Clients] will be able to have their investment account become a self
-sufficient, 
lifelong source of funds accessible
 when needed at any time.ﬂ 
  ﬁThe final result is to have clients be able to withdraw on a consistent basis, 
without affecting their ever
-growing account balance.ﬂ
  ﬁAt SpotFN, we want our clients to be able to attain a constant source of income.ﬂ 
  ﬁWe are l
ooking to create longstanding sustainability for our clients that will be 
shown by the growth of their portfolios.ﬂ 
   ﬁWe are highly motivated to make our clients as successful as possible in tradin
g 
for the very reason that your success is our success.ﬂ
  18. These statements were materially false 
and misleading because 
Suleymanov 
in fact 
caused 
losses for investors. 
In contrast to the ﬁup to 88% returnﬂ that the site touted, many 
investors ultimately lost all, or nearly all, of their invested capital. One inve
stor
™s account 
experienced an ultimate win rate of only 38%, resulting in the loss of his entire account balance. 
Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 5 6  Other investors experienced similarly dismal results, with the same ultimate outcome: depleted 
accounts, no matter how much they invested.
 B. Suleymanov Engaged in Deceptive Conduct to 
Cause
 Losses for Investors
 19. As part of a scheme, 
Suleymanov engaged in deceptive conduct to 
cause
 losses for 
investors. One way that he achieved this was through t
he 
SpotFN 
trading model
. The trading 
model worked
 in the following way: when investors placed a losing trade, they forfeited 100% of 
the amount of that trade. When they placed a winning trade, they typically received 70
-80% of 
the amount of the trade. 
Because the amount of a loss was larger than the amount
 of a gain, 
on average, 
assuming a 50% win rate, 
an account would cumulatively lose value the more it was 

traded.  
 20. In addition, Suleymanov 
used a restrictive withdrawal policy to encourage 
SpotFN 
customers to place a large volume of trades which would 
lead to more losses. Although
 the 

website stated that the client™s success meant SpotFN™s success, the truth was just the opposite. 
The funds that the customers lost, SpotFN gained. 
 21. Suleymanov 
also 
acted behind the scenes and used software to manipulate t
he rates at 
which customers won or lost trades. Suleymanov admitted in a February 2016 email to the 

company that sold him the software that he used it to give new customers high rates of winning 

trades initially to encourage them to invest more funds, then
 he adjusted the setting so the 

investors would experience losses. Suleymanov stated: 
 ﬁWe use that as a marketing tool to lure customers in for the first time, get them to 
deposit as much as possible, let them win– then once all their funds and wires come
 in, 
we then turn that feature into a positive for the platform. –We are controlling the 

situation with them. The wins are their way of bringing in the funds to the company. We 
discussed this– that clients will be given bonuses in the beginning to see how 
easy they 
can win. But again, once the funds are in, that setting gets adjusted to a loss for them. 

This is not our first day at the park with this.ﬂ 
 Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 6 7  C. Suleymanov
 Falsely Promised Inves
tors Easy Access to Their Funds
 22. Suleymanov caused the 
SpotFN website
s to promise investors ﬁhassle free withdrawalsﬂ 
that were ﬁfast and secure.ﬂ One of SpotFN™s selling points was that investments would generate 
profits that would be ﬁaccessible when needed anytime.ﬂ In reality, however, 
Suleymanov 

caused many investors to be
 unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds.
 23. Suleymanov™s primary technique for retaining investors™ money was SpotFN™s so
-called 
bonus policy. 
When investors opened accounts, SpotFN
 frequently credited them with ﬁaccount 
bonuses,ﬂ credits which increased an investor™s trading 
account balance
 beyond what he 
had 

personally funded.
 In some cases, investors recalled being offered these bonuses as an 
inducement to fund a certain amount in
to their accounts, but in other cases, investors simply 

discovered that the amounts had been added without their consent. 
Investors were not warned 
that the bonus money came with 
cons
equences: that every bonus dollar in an account had to be 
traded thirty t
imes before SpotFN would approve any withdrawal request from that account. 
When an investor placed a withdrawal request for funds from his account, SpotFN would often 

cancel the request, citing this policy.
 24. Some investors increase
d the volume of trading in
 their accounts, in order to be eligible 
for cash withdrawals. 
However, increased 
trading volume meant that the investors™ account 
balances depleted quickly as a result of trading losses. 
 25. Some investors received other e
xcuses as to why 
their
 requested wit
hdrawals never 
arrived
. These excuses
 ran the gamut from 
supposed 
bank errors, to computer failures, to frozen 
accounting software, to accidental misrouting to the wrong account. 
A few investors did receiv
e some 
amount of 
withdrawal or refund
, after the investor threatened to pursue a fraud claim or 

charge
-back against SpotFN with their bank or credit card company.
 Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 7 8  26. The SpotFN websites are no longer operational. Once the websites were removed from 
the internet
 in early
 2016, 
investors found that their telephone calls and emails to SpotFN were 
no longer answered. Since investors™ only access to their accounts had been through the SpotFN 
websites, all ability for investors to access or view their account balances, trade or transa
ction 

history, or any other data, vanished along with the site. There was no advance warning that 

SpotFN would be going out of business
, and no procedure for investors to get refunds of the 
balances in their accounts. 
 D. Suleymanov 
Misrepresented That Invest
ors™ Funds 
Were Held in Segregated 
Accounts and Used 
Only for Trading Binary Options
  27. Suleymanov caused t
he SpotFN website 
to state 
that: ﬁUpon receipt of your deposit(s), 
SpotFN
 will place your trading capital into one or more segregated client account(s).ﬂ The 
website stated that the funds could not be used in the course of SpotFN™s business, adding, 

ﬁFunds are used only for trading options through our website upon client™s inst
ructions and are 
never used for any other cause.ﬂ
 The website also stated, ﬁSpotFN™s Compliance Department 
ensures that your deposited funds and trading profits are secure,ﬂ adding
 that
 ﬁthe Compliance 
department specializes in combating fraud and money la
undering, ensuring that your funds are 
always protected.ﬂ 
 28. Contrary to these representations, 
SpotFN did not have a Compliance Department, and 
investors™ funds were not placed into segregated accounts. 
When investors 
transferred 
money
 to 
SpotFN
 to fund their SpotF
N trading accounts, 
their 
mon
ey was 
actually 
commingled in several 
bank
 accounts that were opened and controlled by Suleymanov. 
This was material because
 
investors™ funds
 were not
 used as represented
; the funds
 were not
 secure or protec
ted as 
promised; and 
Suleymanov had access to investors™ fu
nds to use for his own purposes, which 

was not disclosed to the investors. 
 Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8 9  E. Suleymanov Misused Investor Funds
  29. Suleymanov misused certain investor funds
. Instead of ensuring that investors™ funds 
were used only 
for the trading of options as the SpotFN website had claimed
, Suleymanov used 
some of these funds to pay business expenses, such as the payment of salary and other 
compensation to employees, as wel
l as personal expenses, such as payments on his personal 
mortgage.
 In addition, 
Suleymanov
 wrote checks from these accounts to his family members, 
and made transfers from these accounts 
to other business entities that he controlled
, ultimately 
draining eac
h account of funds.

7,7,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a 35-year-old Kentucky man for his role in a scheme that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Jared Gabriel Forrester was installed as a figurehead to run Tennessee-based Tennstar Energy Group, Inc., formerly known as Black Gold Resources, Inc. He misled investors by failing to disclose that two convicted felons actually were running the company. Despite having no background in oil drilling or production efforts, Tennstar's website allegedly described Forrester as having ""an immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits."" Tennstar offering materials also allegedly claimed that Forrester ""had a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the years."" The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had ""worked his way up through the oil fields"" and had been in the industry during his ""whole adult life."" However, Forrester's work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee.

Last year, the SEC charged David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use. In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme. For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian M. Basinger, Stephen E. Donahue, and Edward G. Sullivan of the Atlanta office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the U.S. Secret Service."," 1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Complaint and alleges the following:
 SUMMARY
 1.B
etween at least December 2013 
and February 2016, 
Defendant Jared Gabriel
Forrester
 (ﬁForresterﬂ) 
was directly involved in 
a scheme by 
David R. Greenlee (ﬁGreenleeﬂ) 
and 
David A. Stewart, Jr. (ﬁStewartﬂ)
 that resulted in the 
fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 
million
 of 
securities 
to more than 150 investors.   
2.From 2013 through February 2016, 
Greenlee, Stewart, their principal salesman,
Richard P. Underwood (ﬁUnderwoodﬂ), and other 
salesmen whom Greenlee and Stewart 
recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold interests in various 
limited 
partnerships and 
joint 
ventures that were purportedly cr
eated t
o extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, 
Oklahoma and Texas.
 Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 1 of 14   2 3.   In soliciting investors, Greenlee, 
Stewart
 and Underwood represented that the 
limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to (a) acquire ﬁworking 
interestsﬂ in various oil wells and (b) employ enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as fracking, 

to develop and recover oil from 
the wells.  Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also told investors 

that the entities would sell the oil in order to earn for investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 

percent, or more, per year ﬁfor decades.ﬂ
 4. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through t
wo Tennessee corporations, 
Southern Energy Group, Inc. (ﬁSEGﬂ), which is now administratively dissolved, and Bl
ack Gold 
Resources, Inc.
 (ﬁBGRﬂ)
, which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc. 
(ﬁTennstarﬂ).
 5. Greenlee, Stewart, and Underwood represente
d to investors 
that SEG would 
manage the limited partnerships and Tennstar would manage the joint ventures, and that each of 

these companies w
ould be 
headed by an individual with meaningful experience in the oil 
industry.
 6. Greenlee and Stewart 
installed fig
urehead executives 
for SEG and Tennstar 
who 
pretended to run the companies so that Greenlee and Stewart
Šboth 
convicted 
felons
Šcould 
conceal their own involvement in the 
scheme
. 7. Forrester
 was t
he figurehead installed over Tennstar
, and he knew that he was 
falsely portrayed to investors as both running the company and experienced in the oil industry.
 VIOLATIONS
 8. Forrester
, by virtue of his conduct
, engaged in 
direct violations of Section 17(a) of 
the Securities Act
 of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ)

 A. Background
  17. Between at least January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlee and Stewart, acting 
individually and through a network of
 salesmen whom they recruited and controlled, 
fraudulently sold to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests, called ﬁunits,ﬂ in 
various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell 

oil from exis
ting wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
 18. Specifical
ly, as described in the SEG and 
Tennstar offering materials and the 
corresponding certificates of ownership given to investors, individuals investing funds in the 

projects were buying fractional undivide
d working interests, which in turn provided net revenue 
interests for any profits derived from the purported plans to sell oil recovered from the wells at 

issue.  
 19. For example, the offering materials for Tennstar™s joint ventures explained: ﬁThe 
fraction t
hus obtained will represent the fractional interest of each such Venturer in the costs and 
revenues, if any, of the [Tennstar project].
ﬂ  SEG offering materials used similar language 
regarding the interests sold through SEG™s partnerships.
 20. Greenlee and 
Stewart operated their scheme thr
ough 
SEG f
or the limited 
partnerships and 
Tenn
star for the joint ventures.
 21. Each company was purportedly run by an individual experienced in 
the oil 
industry.
 22. In soliciting investors, Greenlee
, Stewart
 and their sales teams 
represented that the 
limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in 

various oil wells, employ techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells, 
Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 5 of 14   6 and sell the oil to earn investors re
turns
Šin the form of revenue interests
Šranging 
from 15 to 
55 percent or 
more per year, which they said 
would last f
or decades.
 23. In fact, while Greenlee and Stewart used some investor money at several wells to 
create an appearance of activity to dupe investo
rs who wanted to see the wells in production, 
they used nearly two
-thirds of the $15 million raised for their own benefit or to pay the costs of 
conducting the fraud, such as 
radio and internet 
adve
rtising
. 24. Given their criminal backgrounds, 
Greenlee and St
ewart used fake names 
when 
soliciting investors 
to conceal their involvement in the scheme.
 B. Forrester Directly Violated the Antifraud Provisions of the Securities Laws
  25. Forrester 
was the figurehead installed by G
reenlee and Stewart to run 
Tennstar
. 26. Forrester
 was portrayed to investors as 
run
ning 
Tennstar
 when
, in reality
, that 
entity 
was controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.
  27. Forrester incorporated the company at their request using $18,000 they provided, 
listed himself as Tennstar™s registered agent, 
and opened the entity™s offices in Tennessee and 
South Florida to house its boiler
-room sales staff.
 28. When investors ultimately provided their mo
ney to Tennstar, Forrester followed 
instructions from Greenlee and Stewart regarding
 how much to pay 
to the sale
s team, how much 
to spend on advertising, and how much to funnel to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and 

Stewart
 for personal misappropriation
Šnone of which was disclosed to investors as anticipated 
use of their funds
. 29. In addition to allowing himself
 to be portrayed falsely as running the company, 
Forrester was also active in the offer and sale of investments in Tennstar™s offerings.  
In fact, h
e was the Tennstar employee who typically was listed 
on shipping labels 
as the sender 
of offering 
Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 6 of 14   7 materials 
via mail or 
common carrier
 to investors, knowing that 
those materials included a fake 
biography of himself.  
 For example, in July 2015, Forrester sent by common carrier a package of 
Tennstar offering materials to a Southern District of Georgia resident in
 Savannah, Georgia.  The 
materials included the false biography of Forrester.  The Southern District of Georgia resident 

ultimately invested $28,000 in a Tennstar offering, but never received any profits or distributions 

from the investment.
 30. That
 fake
 biog
raphy claimed that Forrester, who was 29 years old when his role in 
the Tennstar fraud began, ﬁhad a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the yearsﬂ 

and had been ﬁpart of the 30+ years of [oil] field projects that his family ha[d] develope
d.ﬂ  The 
biography
, written chiefly by Stewart and approved by Forrester,
 then asserted that Forrester™s 
experience had given him ﬁground
-level field development expertise in the oil patchﬂ and ﬁan 
immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how t
o effectively maximize profits.ﬂ  
 31. None of this was true since, prior to his figurehead role at Tennstar, Forrester had 
never worked in any legitimate oil drilling or production effort, nor had Forrester™s family 

members ever been involved in ﬁ30+ years of
 [oil] field projects.ﬂ
 32. Forrester knew Greenlee and Stewart were using fake names when soliciting 
investors, and he touted his own fake industry experience in verbal solicitations of investors.  
 33. For instance, in an audio file created by Tennstar in what a
ppears to have been an 
effort to coach and train its salesmen, Forrester was recorded on a telephone call soliciting a 

prospective investor to purchase an interest in a Tennstar joint venture
.  During the call, Forrester 
told
 the prospective investor that 
Forrester had been in the oil business almost all of his life, 
claiming at one point during the call that he had worked in the industry 
since he was ﬁin 

diapers.ﬂ
   Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 7 of 14   8 34. Additionally, when soliciting investors, Forrester used call scripts provided by 
Greenlee a
nd Stewart for the boiler
-room sales teams, claiming falsely that investments in 
Tennstar™s joint ventures were low risk and profitable
.  Forrester knew
 such claims
 were false 
because, among other things, as head of Tennstar he signed and distributed inves
tor distribution 
checks and knew most investors were receiving little, if any, return on their invested funds.
 35. For instance, in July 2014, Forrester solicited and sold a Tennstar joint interest 
investment to a male investor, then a 50 year
-old Florida resi
dent.  
 36. The Florida inves
tor initially had contacted SEG
Šthe other fraudulent entity 
controlled by Greenlee and Stewart
Šafter 
hearing an 
SEG radio advertisement 
about oil 
investment opportun
ities.  In response to the Florida investor
™s inquiry, Forrester c
alled the 
Florida investor and, after asking about the Florida investor™s income, told him that his earnings 
were insufficient to invest in an SEG opportunity
, but 
noted that 
the Florida investor co
uld invest
 in a Tennstar joint venture instead.  
 37. In solic
iting the Florida investor, Forrester falsely told the man that SEG and 
BGR were unrelated and that Forrester had 
ﬁworked his way up through the oil fields
ﬂ and had 
been in the oil industry 
ﬁhis whole adult life
.ﬂ   38. When the Florida investor
 asked Forreste
r if the 
Tennstar offering was
Šin his 
words
Šﬁon the up and up
,ﬂ Forrester responded
 by telling him, as the Florida investor recalled
:  ﬁI™m a man of God. 
 I love my family and my faith is most important to
 me.  And I™m not lying 
to you.ﬂ 
  39. After hearing th
is, the Florida investor told Forrester to send him further 
information on the offering, which Forrester did by sending him offering materials 
by common 

carrier 
that contained Forrester™s fake biography.
 Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 8 of 14   9 40. After receiving these materials, the Florida investo
r had another call with 
Forrester.  During this call, the Florida investor asked Forrester about the risks of a Tennstar 
investment.  Forrester responded by telling the Florida investor not to worry about risk because 

Forrester™s prior experience in the oi
l industry was alleviating that risk.  
 41. Forrester further told the Florida investor that he could receive a 30 percent return 
on his investment, adding, as the Florida investor recalled, that the ﬁoil flow is expected to last 

for decades, if not longer.ﬂ  
 42. Based on Forrester™s representations about the investment and his supposed 
indust
ry experience, the Florida investor
 invested a total of $80,000 into two separate Tennstar 
joint venture of
ferings
Šan amount that the Florida investor
 described to Forrester 
as being 
almost all of his life savings
.  The Florida investor
, in making his investment decision, believed 
that Forrester™s 
purported 
experience 
would make the joint ventures 
success
ful
. 43. Subsequently, in February 2015, Forrester told the Florida investor in letters that 
he signed as Tennstar™s 
President and 
CEO that the oil wells in which the Florida investor had 

invested had turned out to be dry.  
 44. Forrester assured the Florida investor t
hat his investment would be moved to a 
different Tennstar joint venture but that no new paperwork was necessary.  Forrester further 

assured the Florida investor that the new joint venture was a ﬁsure thing.ﬂ  
 45. The Florida investor eventually received a few
 small distribution checks from 
Tennstar, totaling no more than $550.  He never received his promised return on his investment 

or any refund of his invested amount.

 offered and sold to more than
 90 investors at least $

    Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 14 of 14"
10,10,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Utah-based company and its principal in an ongoing investment scheme that has defrauded hundreds of investors in several states.

The SEC alleges that Gaylen D. Rust and his company Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (RRC) are engaged in an ongoing investment scheme involving a purported silver trading program. Through this scheme, Rust and RRC have allegedly raised over $85 million since January 2017. According to the SEC, Rust told investors that he has access to a trading algorithm that enables him to capitalize on fluctuations in the price of silver bullion and thereby make profitable trades, regardless of the actual price of silver. He also told investors that he stores millions of tons of physical silver on behalf of investors at Brink's Global Services U.S.A. Inc. Rust claimed that his silver trading program results in average annual returns of 20% to 25%, with some years experiencing significantly higher returns. Rust also told investors that his silver trading program has almost no risk. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Rust has been using new investor funds to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for his personal expenses and the business expenses of other entities he controls.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, charges Rust and RRC with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Under the direction of Regional Director Daniel Wadley, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Alison Okinaka, Scott Frost, and Laurie Abbott, and litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver. The SEC wishes to thank the Utah Division of Securities, the Utah Attorney General's Office, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter."," David D.

(""RRC"") (collectively,""Defendants"") alleges as follows:INTRODUCTION1. This matter involves a fraudulent silver trading program operated by Rust andRRC. Since at least January 1, 2017, Rust has been soliciting investors to invest in a schemepurportedly involving the trading of silver bullion. 2. Rust has raised funds from approximately 300 investors across the country for thesilver trading program, and has been doing so since at least January 1, 2017. From that datethrough August 2018 alone, he may have raised approximately $85.7 million from investors inthe silver trading progam.3. Rust solicits investors by making material misrepresentations and omissions. Themisrepresentations about the silver trading program relate to, among others, the amount of silverhe maintains in safekeeping for investors at Brink's Global Services USA (""Brink's""); his silvertrading methods; his past performance; the use of investor funds; and the safety of theinvestment.4. In fact, Rust does not maintain any amount of silver in storage with Brink's; is notemploying the sophisticated silver trading strategies he advertises to investors; is not achievingthe returns he is representing to investors; and is putting investor funds at risk by spending themon his personal businesses and on himself and his family members.JURISDICTION AND VENUE5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction by authority of Sections 20 and 22 ofthe Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa.6. Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly and in concert, have made use of themeans and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the mails in connection with thetransactions, acts and courses of business alleged herein, certain of which have occurred withinthe District of Utah.7. Venue for this action is proper in the District of Utah under Section 22(a) of theSecurities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]2 because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in thisComplaint took place in this district and because Defendants reside in and transact business inthis district.8. Defendants, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to engagein the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein and in transactions,acts, practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object.9. Defendants' conduct took place in connection with the offer, purchase and/or saleof investment contracts issued by Rust, which are securities.DEFENDANTS10. Gaylen Dean Rust, 59 (""Rust""), is a resident of Layton, Utah. He is the presidentand sole director of RRC, and also controls a number of other businesses. Rust operates theRRC retail store in downtown Salt Lake City.11. Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (""RRC""), is a Utah corporation with its principal office inSalt Lake City, Utah. It was founded in 1966 by Rust's father and is operated by Rust. RRC'sretail store and website sells rare coins, collectible paper money and precious metal bullion. Thestore specializes in early Mormon currency. Its manager is Rust's son Joshua.STATEMENT OF FACTSBackground Šthe silver trading program12. In addition to managing the retail coin business of RRC, Rust solicits investors toplace their funds into a purported investment that is based on the purchase and sale of silverbullion (the ""silver trading program""). Rust tells investors that he trades only physical silver,rather than silver futures.13. The silver trading program is managed and controlled solely by Rust.3 14. Rust represents that he uses 100% of investor funds to buy silver. Rust tellsinvestors that he stores all the silver bullion that he has purchased with investor funds at Brink'sGlobal Services USA (""Brink's"") in either Salt Lake City or Los Angeles, with 85% of investorsilver being stored in Salt Lake City.15. Rust tells investors that he trades with only half the amount of silver he hasbought for the investor, storing the other half in safekeeping.16. In the fall of 2018, Rust told investors he was storing almost $80 million of silverat Brink's.17. Rust represents to investors that he conducts all of the silver trades for theprogram through an account in the name of RRC at HSBC Bank Plc (""HSBC""). He states thathe trades using an algorithm generated by HSBC that enables him to sell at the point when theprice of silver begins to fall and to buy the silver back just before the price recovers.18. Rust represents that he uses the profit he has generated in his trades to repurchasea larger amount of silver at the lower price, thereby continually increasing the amount of silverhe holds for the investor.19. Rust represents to investors that by using the HSBC algorithm he has neverexperienced a losing month, much less a losing year. He told one prospective investor that in hisworst year he had still earned 12% a year for his investors, and that he averaged returns of 20 to25% a year.20. Rust told one prospective investor that the only risk of an investment in the silvertrading program was that the price of silver would ""go to zero.""21. Rust tells investors that he does not charge a management fee, but compensateshimself by keeping partial shares of silver left over from the trades.L! 22. Rust reassures investors that they can withdraw their funds at any time onapproximately two weeks' notice.23. Prospective investors in the silver trading program do not receive any kind ofoffering materials.24. Rust provides account statements to investors. The statements consist only of aspreadsheet showing the purported transactions over a given month. They report the profitspurportedly generated from Rust's trades during the month, the total ounces of silver owned by agiven investor at month's end, and the total value of the investor's holdings based on the price ofsilver at the time.25. The spreadsheet included in the account statement is prepared by Rust in a basicExcel format. Some of the statements were printed on the letterhead of RRC.26. Rust has been soliciting investors for the silver trading program since at leastJanuary 2017, and the solicitation is ongoing.27. Currently, there are approximately 300 investors in many states across thecountry.28. From January 2017 through August 2018, Rust raised approximately $85.7million from investors in the silver trading program.Uses of investor funds.29. From January 1, 2017 through August 2018, Rust processed funds invested in thesilver trading program through two accounts at Zions Bank. He used the first account ending in7496 (the ""investor account""), for almost all investor deposits and payments back to investors.He used another account, ending in 3564 (the ""Rust coin account""), primarily for activity related5 to his coin business, but also to some extent for investor transactions. Funds are heavilycommingled among these accounts because Rust transferred funds to and from them frequently.MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONSRust and RRC did not store investor silver at Brink's.30. In the fall of 2018, Rust told investors he was storing $80 million of investorsilver at Brink's. Brink's, however, has not held any silver for Rust or any of his entities sincelate 2016.Rust and RRC do not have an account at HSBC, and do not use its algorithm to tradesilver.31. Rust represents to investors that he pools investor funds in an account held byRRC at HSBC and that he trades silver using an algorithm developed by HSBC. He representedto investors that, thanks to this algorithm, he has never had a losing month trading silver. HSBC,however, has stated that it has never maintained an account in the name of Rust or RRC.Investor funds were not used to buy silver in the trading program.32. Rust represents to investors that he uses all investor funds to buy silver to beplaced in the silver trading program. In fact, Rust is diverting most of the investor funds hereceives to his other entities, to personal uses, and to make payments to other investors. FromJanuary 1, 2017 through August 2018 Rust took in approximately $85.7 million from investors.Of this, approximatelya. $70,243,523 was paid out in checks and wires in payments to earlier investors inthe silver trading program;b. $2,667,700 was withdrawn in cash;c. $1,162,000 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Racing, which Rust uses forhis horse racing business;d. $9,165,969 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Entertainment and itssubsidiaries and used for payroll, vendors, equipment and other expenses relatedto Rust's music and production studio; ande. $2,039,994 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Investment.C1 33. These uses account for approximately 99% of the investor deposits into thisaccount.34. Investors were not told that their funds would be used for purposes other than toinvest in the silver trading program.Average returns from the silver trading program, if any, were far less than 20% to 25%.35. Rust represents to investors that his average trading returns for the program are20% to 25% a year or, as he told one investor, 40% a year. He also told an investor that hisworst trading month had still achieved a return of 3%; and that his best trading month hadachieved a return of 21 %.36. Very little silver trading, if any, is taking place in either the investor account orRust coin account at Zions Bank. Evidence suggests the only likely silver-trading expendituresout of the investor account total less than $100,000, involving transactions with precious metaland coin brokers. The Rust coin account expenditures are typical of the retail coin business atRRC, not of a silver trading program.The investor account statements provided by Rust are false.37. The account statements that Rust creates and provides to investors contain falsestatements. They show that Rust engages in various silver trades on behalf of each investorevery month, resulting in a monthly increase in the number of ounces owned by each investor.They also show that the investor owns many ounces of physical silver. In fact, Rust does nottrade silver through HSBC as he represents, nor does he store investor silver at Brink's.Materiality of Misrepresentations38. Rust's misrepresentations to investors and potential investors are material becauseinvestors would certainly find it important to know that Rust does not maintain a trading account7 at HSBC for investors; does not store quantities of investor silver at Brink's; is conducting littleif any silver trading; and is using investor funds for a variety of undisclosed purposes, includingfunding his related entities and paying returns to earlier investors.Scienter of Rust39. Rust knew his representations were false and misleading at the time he made thembecause he has at all times been in possession of the true facts, namely, that he is not storinginvestor silver bullion at Brink's; that he does not have a trading account at HSBC; that he is notusing an HSBC algorithm to trade; that he is carrying out little or no silver trading at all; that heis preparing and transmitting false account statements to investors; and that he is using investorfunds not for silver trading but to make payments to his related entities and to prior investors.The Investments in the Silver Trading Program Are Securities Being Sold in UnregisteredTransactions.40. The purchase of an interest in the silver trading program involves an investmentof money.41. Investor funds are aggregated together in the investor account and, to a lesserextent, in the Rust coin account.42. Payment of the purported investor returns is entirely dependent on Rust'sexecution of the trades in silver bullion. Investors have no role in the silver trading.43. Rust sold millions of dollars of investments in the silver trading program in anunregistered continuous offering to dozens of investors across the United States.44. Rust provided no offering materials to prospective investors.45. Rust never took any steps to determine whether a prospective investor wasaccredited. He never asked investors questions concerning their income or net worth. 46. The investments in the silver trading program were offered and sold to personswho were not accredited within the meaning of the federal securities laws.CLAIMS FOR RELIEFFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEFEMPLOYMENT OF A DEVICE, SCHEME OR ARTIFICE TO DEFRAUDViolation of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1)]47.

11,11,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a stock research firm and its co-founders with defrauding investors by issuing reports purportedly based on ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" research when in reality they received thousands of dollars from issuers as a condition to providing each report.

According to the SEC's complaint, SeeThruEquity LLC and brothers Ajay and Amit Tandon camouflaged the payments by inviting companies to make a ""presentation"" at an investor conference in order to receive a research report for free.  SeeThru and the Tandons allegedly collected up to several thousand dollars in conference presentation fees per company, and the issuers regularly had input into the substance of the supposedly unbiased research reports, even including the price targets at times. The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru's reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock.

The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.  According to the SEC's complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure.

""There is a clear line between paid advertising and unbiased research coverage, and we allege that SeeThru and its co-founders crossed it to deceive investors and make money,"" said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office.  ""According to our complaint, Ajay Tandon even scalped multiple issuers, further revealing the biased nature of SeeThru's research reports.""

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Ajay and SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Amit with aiding and abetting those violations. It also charges SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; charges Ajay with violating the antifraud and antitouting provisions of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act; charges Amit with violating the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; and charges Ajay with aiding and abetting certain of SeeThru's antifraud and antitouting violations. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction that would bar Ajay, Amit, and SeeThru from promoting the issuer of any security, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director and penny stock bars.

The SEC's litigation will be led by Pat Huddleston II and Paul Kim of the Atlanta office.  The SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua M. Dickman and supervised by Natalie M. Brunson of the Atlanta office."," SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION950 East Paces Ferry Rd, N.E., Suite 900Atlanta, GA 30326Tel: 404.842.7616UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORKSECURITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,Plaintiff,v.SEETHRUEQUITY, LLC,AJAY TANDON, andAMIT TANDON,Defendants.COMPLAINTCivil Action No.Jury Trial DemandedPlaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission""), for its Complaint allegesas follows:SUMMARY OF THE ALLEGATIONS1. Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon, with and through their company, SeeThruEquity,LLC (""STE""), defrauded investors and prospective investors by purporting to provide unbiasedresearch reports on certain publicly-traded small and microcap companies. Defendantsrepresented that STE's reports were ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for,"" that the price targets includedin them were objectively determined, that Defendants did not own the stocks being covered, andthat Defendants took precautions to maintain STE's objectivity. Contrary to those claims,Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 1 of 25 Defendants were compensated handsomely by the covered companies for the research reportsthey published. In addition, Defendants inflated price targets for the companies for which theypublished research reports and made other false statements and omissions, repeatedly violatingboth the anti-fraud and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.2. In addition, Ajay Tandon violated the anti-fraud provisions by investing in STE-covered companies and selling his holdings in the immediate aftermath of favorable STEresearch reports, reaping profits from that illegal pattern of trading.JURISDICTION AND VENUE3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(d)(1) and22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d)(1) and 77v(a)] andSections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [ 15U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].4. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means andinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails or of the facilities of a national securitiesexchange, in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein, certain ofwhich occurred within the Southern District of New York.5. Venue in this district is proper under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because defendantstransact business in this district and certain of the acts, practices, transactions and courses ofbusiness constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within the Southern District of NewYork.2Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 2 of 25 THE DEFENDANTS6. SeeThruEquity, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that was co-founded in 2011 by brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon. STE purports to be a stockresearch company that primarily covers small and microcap issuers. In addition to publishingstock research reports, which it has done since its inception in 2011, STE also periodically hostsinvestor conferences, which it has done approximately twenty-five times since June 2012.7. Aiay Tandon, 41, is a resident of New York, New York. He is the co-founderand CEO of defendant STE. He has experience in the securities industry, having held Series 7and 63 licenses (general securities representative) as well as a Series 241icense (generalsecurities principal).8. Amit Tandon, 47, is a resident of New York, New York. He is the co-founderand Director of Research of defendant STE. He is an attorney and a member of the New YorkBar.FACTSBackground of SeeThruEquity, LLC9. Unless another time is specified, each of the allegations in this Complaint refers tothe period November 9, 2013 to present.10. STE purports to be an equity research company focused on smaller emerginggrowth companies.11. Headquartered in New York City (Manhattan) at all times described herein, STEpublishes research reports on the companies that it covers.3Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 3 of 25 12. STE posts those research reports (including all reports referred to herein) on itswebsite (www.seethruequity.com), distributes them to an opt-in email distribution list estimatedto include 20,000 investors, transmits them for further distribution to aggregators of equityresearch reports such as Thomson First Call, makes them available via links to its website onother social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, and, often, announces and links tothem through press releases.13. Brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon co-founded STE in 2011.14. Amit Tandon filed the formation documents for STE, creating the company as aDelaware single member limited liability company.15. Ajay Tandon is the sole member of STE and its Chief Executive Officer.16. Amit Tandon is STE's Director of Research.17. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon had log-in credentials for STE's website andsocial media accounts.18. Ajay Tandon and, from approximately early 2016, Amit Tandon, had signatoryauthority over STE's primary bank account.19. Both Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon drew regular salaries from STE.Research Reports on Companies in STE's Coverage Universe20. Defendants refer to the collection of companies for which STE has issuedresearch reports as STE's ""coverage universe.""21. As of the date of this complaint, STE's coverage universe consists of at least 240companies.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 4 of 25 22. An STE ""initiation report"" is STE's first research report on a company. Suchreports typically are 15 to 20 pages long.23. An STE '`update report'"" is a research report on a company for which STE haspreviously published an initiation report. Such reports typically are three to five pages long.24. Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon divided roughly evenly the responsibilities ofSTE's research business, including responsibility for overseeing the completion of STE researchreports.25. In general, the Tandon brother responsible for any specific report is listed as a""contact person"" in the specific report.26. The report preparation process began with Ainit Tandon or Ajay Tandon giving toan analyst, retained as an STE contractor, an assignment to prepare a research report.27. STE compensated its contract analysts on a per report basis, typically at a rate of$1,000 per report.28. Having received an assignment, STE's contract analysts input relevant financialdata into a spreadsheet quantitative model (""the STE Model"" or ""Model"")) designed to perform aquantitative analysis and produce certain outputs, including a purportedly objective ""price target""for the company's stock.29. Each STE research report listed the price target next to a recent historical price ofthe stock.30. For example, the October 5, 2017 STE initiation report published on issuerCemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), includes the following:Price Target: $6.45Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 5 of 25 Recent Share Price: $2.8431. Investors and prospective investors who read that report therefore wouldreasonably conclude that STE's purportedly objective analysis revealed a potential for priceappreciation in CETX stock of more than double the current trading price.32. Every single purportedly objective price target that STE has ever published hasbeen higher than the stock in question's then-current trading price.33. STE's contract analysts used the product of the STE Model to prepare a draft ofthe research report, which they then forwarded either to Amit Tandon or Ajay Tandon,depending on which of the Tandons had given them the assignment.34. Working from the draft, Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon finalized, published, anddistributed the research reports.35. As more fully set forth below, in connection with the creation and publication ofSTE research reports and related communications, Defendants made misrepresentations andomissions relating to, among other things: (1) the supposed ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" natureof STE's research, (2) Ajay Tandon's ownership of stocks in the STE coverage universe, (3) theobjectivity of STE's published price targets, (4) the existence of ""customary internal tradingrestrictions,"" and (5) the scalping of STE covered-stocks.Misrepresentations and Omissions RegardingSupposedly ""Unbiased"" and ""Not Paid For"" Research36. All of the research reports issued by Defendants from November 9, 2013 throughat least March 30, 2018, made the representation, or some variation thereof, that ""SeeThruEquityCase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 6 of 25 has not been compensated for the preparation of this report by any third party or the companycovered in the report.""37. STE also represented on its website, on which it posted all STE research reports,and in press releases that often accompanied newly issued STE research reports, that its researchwas ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for.""38. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon knew when they finalized and issued thereports for which they were responsible that these representations in STE's reports and pressreleases and on STE's website were false and that STE had, in fact, been compensated for eachreport to the tune of several thousand dollars in each instance.39. In addition, Ajay Tandon, as STE's CEO and the person with ultimate authorityover the content of STE's research reports, provided substantial assistance to STE by approvingfor publication STE's reports, all of which omitted any disclosure regarding the compensationreceived for those reports.40. To obscure the compensation they received for preparing and disseminatingresearch reports, Defendants ostensibly invited companies to make a ""presentation"" at aninvestor conference in return for STE providing a ""free"" research report for that company.41. Defendants charged between $4,000 and $7,000 for the company to make apresentation at an STE conference. Defendants then claimed that the STE equity research reportthat STE published thereafter was provided at no charge.42. Defendants held out the research reports as ""not paid for,"" although they receivedthousands of dollars for issuing each research report.7Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 7 of 25 43. On at least one occasion, Ajay Tandon directed a STE research analyst to put aresearch report on hold because a company had ""not paid for the conference.""44. Approximately 233 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 97%, paid STE ostensible conference presentation fees, andfour other companies paid STE for supposed ""distribution"" or ""press release"" services relating toSTE's research. Put another way, 237 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 98%, paid STE.45. STE received at least $500,000 from companies in its coverage universe, fromJanuary 1, 2014 to the present.46. In at least one instance, Defendants did not even bother to hide behind theirconference model.47. Specifically, in September 2017, Cemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) explicitlyagreed to pay STE $14,500, in exchange for STE providing Cemtrex 18 months of researchcoverage, including one initiation report and five quarterly update reports, with press releases toaccompany each report.48. Defendant Ajay Tandon negotiated this arrangement with CETX49. Yet the press release announcing the publication of the CETX initiation reportincluded the following:SeeThruEquity has pioneered an innovative business model forequity research that is not paid for and is unbiased. (emphasisadded).50. None of the Defendants' research reports for CETX disclosed this compensation.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 8 of 25 51. Beginning in or about August 2016, STE began stating in its ""Disclosures"" that it""may"" receive compensation from the companies featured in its report for ""non-report-relatedservices,"" including presenting at STE conferences. At no time, however, did any of theDefendants tell investors and prospective investors that STE was in fact receiving compensationfrom the covered companies.Defendants' Research Reports for Quadrant 4 Systems Corp.Misrepresent Compensation and Ownership of a Covered Stock52. In connection with its coverage of Quadrant 4 Systems Corp. (OTCMKTS:QFOR), Defendants concocted an elaborate scheme to conceal STE's receipt of compensationfrom that issuer and ownership of the issuer's shares, structuring the payment of QFOR sharesthrough athird-party nominee.53. Ajay Tandon was primarily responsible for the QFOR initiation report (issued inDecember 2012), and update report (issued in December 2013).54. Approximately one month prior to the publication of the initiation report, QFORissued a QFOR stock certificate for 10,000 shares of restricted stock to a Rajinder Bither(""Bither"").55. Bither is Ajay and Amit Tandon's uncle.56. Bither has never lived in the United States. He lives in India.57. Rather than mail the stock certificate to Bither in India, however, Ajay Tandondirected the issuer (or its transfer agent) to mail the stock certificate to STE's Manhattan office.58. Bither has never done any work for QFOR or STE, but the 10,000 shares ofQFOR issued to Bither were allegedly compensation for consulting work he did for QFOR.ECase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 9 of 25 59. The only evidence of that consulting work is a ""consulting agreement"" purportingto be between Bither and QFOR.60. As originally drafted, the consulting agreement was between QFOR and STE, notBither.61. There are handwritten edits on the consulting agreement by which someonecrossed out STE's name and inserted Bither's.62. The consulting agreement was edited to hide the fact that Ajay Tandon owned10,000 shares of QFOR, received as payment for a favorable STE research report.63. In December 2012, STE published its initiation report on QFOR.64. STE's price target for QFOR in the initiation report was $.59, more than fourtimes the then-current trading price of $.14.65. The December 2012 QFOR initiation report falsely claimed that neither STE norits principals owned shares of QFOR.66. In December 2013, STE published its QFOR update report.67. That December 2013 report falsely claimed that neither STE nor its principalsowned shares of QFOR.68. Ajay Tandon and STE still had the 10,000 certificated shares (issued to Bither) intheir possession on the day the update report was published in December 2013.69. Ajay Tandon considered those shares his, and he knew that the insertion of Bitherinto the scenario was designed to hide his ownership of these shares.70. In fact, on December 4, 2013, five days prior to the publication of the updatereport, Ajay Tandon wrote a letter to the QFOR transfer agent requesting the removal of the10Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 10 of 25 restrictive legend from the 10,000 shares and further asking that the shares be reissued,unrestricted, in his (Ajay Tandon's) name.71. An unrestricted QFOR share certificate was in fact issued in Ajay Tandon's nameon December 9, 2013, the same day that STE published the QFOR update report.72. By using his uncle's name on the QFOR consulting agreement and as the initialpurported holder of QFOR stock, Ajay Tandon hid the fact that STE was not the ""unbiased""equity research company that the Tandons represented it to be.73. Moreover, QFOR is not the only stock about which Ajay Tandon hasmisrepresented share ownership.74. In 2014 and 2015, Ajay Tandon gave multiple interviews to an online publicationcalled the Life Sciences Report.75. In each of his interviews he affirmatively disclaimed both stock ownership andany financial interest in the issuers discussed.76. However, at the time he was interviewed, Ajay Tandon owned stock in at leasttwo of the issuers discussed during the interviews, and nearly all of the issuers discussed hadpaid to present at STE conferences.Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Objectivity of STE Price Targets77. As mentioned above (paragraphs 26 through 34), Defendants contracted withanalysts to perform purportedly objective quantitative modeling in order to project future pricesof equity securities of STE-covered issuers.78. The Defendants used the STE Model from the inception of STE in 2011 topresent.11Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 11 of 25 79. The STE Model required an STE analyst to input certain data about the issuer, atwhich point the Model would produce a figure called a ""price target,"" representing the Model'sprojection of what a share of the issuer's stock would be worth in the future.80. STE often issued press releases in conjunction with publication of its researchreports and often highlighted the ""price target"" in such releases.81. Although the STE Model through which STE performed analysis of issuersyielded a supposedly objective price target, 100% of STE's published price targets were inexcess of the then-current trading price.82. Moreover, STE often published a different, higher, price target, going well abovethe Model's initial results.83. Having paid STE thousands of dollars, issuers expected to, and often did, receiveinput into the substance of STE's supposedly unbiased research reports, including the pricetarget.84. Again, for all 233 companies in STE's coverage universe as of March 31, 2018 onwhich STE had issued a price target, every single price target was higher than the subject stock'scurrent trading price.85. Moreover, the average STE price target was more than 300% higher than thecurrent trading price.86. Both Ajay and Amit Tandon periodically instructed STE analysts to increase theprice targets generated by the STE Model.87. On the instruction of the Tandons, STE analysts increased the price targets abovethe targets generated by the STE Model.12Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 12 of 25 88. On occasion, the Tandons instructed their analysts to make the price target acertain specific figure, or within a specific range, even before the financial modeling had beencompleted.89. By way of specific example for a report created by Amit Tandon, in March 2017,in connection with the preparation of a research report on a company with the ticker symbolFTNW, Amit Tandon instructed the analyst preparing the draft (""Analyst 1 ""), ""Let's try and do$2.75 on the PT.""90. Analyst 1 complied, and Amit Tandon approved the report for release on March21, 2017, with a price target of $2.75.91. The FTNW report does not disclose that Amit Tandon dictated the price target forFTNW.92. On other occasions the Tandons directed STE analysts to increase the price targetsafter issuers Šwho were provided an initial draft of the report before publication Šcomplainedthat the price target should be higher.93. The Defendants failed to disclose in STE reports that price targets were increasedin order to better satisfy the issuers.94. Such information would have been important to a reasonable investor.95. The above-mentioned QFOR update report issued in December 2013 (seeparagraphs 52 through 73) provides another example of undisclosed influence (this time of AjayTandon) on STE's supposedly unbiased price targets.96. In December 2013, QFOR was trading at $1.14.13Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 13 of 25 97. In or about November 2013, an STE analyst (""Analyst 2"") was assigned toprepare a draft of the QFOR update report.98. Analyst 2 input the relevant data into the STE quantitative model, at which pointthe model produced a price target of $1.78, 56 percent above the then-current price ($1.14).99. On December 6, 2013, Analyst 2 sent Ajay Tandon the draft QFOR update reportshowing the price target of $1.78.100. On the morning of December 9, the date of publication, Ajay Tandon respondedto Analyst 2, stating, ""let's push it north of $2,"" referring to the price target.101. Analyst 2 responded, ""I can make it any #, but I had to stretch it very much just toget to these #s.""102. Ajay Tandon responded that he nevertheless wanted to push the price target""above $2, because it is a stock `hurdle' if you get my meaning.""103. Analyst 2 responded, ""[u]nderstood, just wanted to let you know this one is a realstretch,"" and Ajay Tandon stated, ""[fair enough."" Analyst 2 then adjusted the price target to$2.26 in a 10:47 AM draft of the report.104. Around noon on December 9, Ajay Tandon sent the draft update report, with the$2.26 price target, to QFOR's CEO.105. QFOR's CEO expressed displeasure with the price target.106. In reaction to that displeasure, Ajay Tandon instructed Analyst 2 to raise the pricetarget further.14Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 14 of 25 107. By 3:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised STE'sprice target to $3.16, at which point Ajay Tandon told Analyst 2 that he still wanted it raised""considerably.""108. By 4:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised theprice target to $5.25Šmore than double the ""real stretch"" price target of earlier in the day.109. Thereafter, also on December 9, 2013, Ajay Tandon finalized and publishedSTE's update report on QFOR by, among other things, posting it on the STE website,distributing it to the STE opt-in email distribution list, transmitting it to Thomson First Call, FactSet, and Capital IQ, and issuing a press release.110. That press release said, among other things:SeeThruEquity, LLC, a New York City based firm focused onproviding unbiased and institutional equity research ... issued acompany update report on ... QFOR.SeeThruEquity is an approved equity research contributor onThomson One Analytics (First Call).[STE] research is unbiased and not paid for research.111. In truth, the research report was both paid for and biased.112. No investor reading the report or the press release could know that the price targetreflected in the published QFOR report was nearly 300 percent higher than the price targetproduced by STE's supposedly objective quantitative analysis, nor that Ajay Tandon had orderedthe price target increased dramatically to better please the issuer.113. Both the facts misrepresented and the facts omitted would have been important toa reasonable investor.15Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 15 of 25 Misrepresentations Concerning Nonexistent ""Customary Trading Restrictions""114. In or about August 2016, STE began adding language to the ""Disclosures"" portionof each STE research report, including initiation and update reports, stating that STE ""followscustomary internal trading restrictions pending the release of its reports.""115. That representation was false each time the Defendants made it, and it furtheredthe false impression that STE reports were not colored by the Tandons' financial interests.116. At no time did STE have any formal or informal trading restrictions, and theTandons observed no such restrictions.117. In fact, on at least one occasion described in more detail below, Ajay Tandonengaged in scalping of an STE-covered stock despite STE representing that it ""follow[ed]customary internal trading restrictions pending release of its report.""118. Specifically, on October 24, 2016, Ajay Tandon scalped an STE-covered stock(MassRoots, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MSRT)) on the same day that STE published a research report onthe issuer that contained the misrepresentation about `'customary internal trading restrictions.''Ajay Tandon Scalped Covered Stocks119. Making a stock recommendation and then contemporaneously trading against thatrecommendation without adequate disclosure of that trading is a form of securities fraud knownas ""scalping.""120. Ajay Tandon engaged in multiple instances of scalping between 2014 and thepresent.121. A representative example of Ajay Tandon's scalping occurred in 2014. In mid-January 2014, the issuer Medient Studios, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MDNT) was introduced to STE.16Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 16 of 25 122. By January 27, 2014, MDNT had agreed to pay STE several thousand dollars forresearch.123. On March 17, 2014, Ajay Tandon purchased $12,700 of MDNT stock-850,000shares, at an average share price of approximately $.015.124. The next dayŠMarch 18, 2014STE published its initiation report on MDNT,with a price target of $.13, more than eight tunes the price Ajay Tandon paid for his shares theday prior.125. Also on March 18, MDNT's stock price nearly doubledŠfrom approximately$.O1 to $.02Šand Ajay 'I'andon sold all 850,000 shares, for cone-day profit of approximately$6,500.126. The MDNT report's ""Disclosures"" stated only that ""SeeThru and/or its affiliatesmay have a long or short position with respect to the publicly traded shares of the subjectcompany covered in this report.''127. The report did not disclose that Ajay Tandon in fact owned MDNT shares or thathe was planning to sell them on the date of publication.128. Ajay Tandon engaged in similar scalping activityŠselling STE-covered stocksfor prices less than STE's price targets, within one to two days of STE publishing research on theissuers, and without disclosure in at least ten other issuers (including MSRT, as mentionedabove).129. Ajay Tandon generated approximately $20,000 in profits from those trades.130.

12,12,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged James E. Hengen with insider trading based on material, nonpublic information that he misappropriated from his wife, a human resources executive at a healthcare company who worked on corporate acquisitions.

The SEC alleges that Hengen, whose wife worked for a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Inc., misappropriated material, nonpublic information concerning UnitedHealth's pending acquisitions of two companies, USMD Holdings, Inc. and Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. According to the complaint, Hengen learned of the pending acquisition of USMD in June 2016 when he overheard one of his wife's phone calls while she was working from home. In breach of his duty to his wife, Hengen then purchased USMD stock based on that information and tipped four other individuals, who also purchased the stock. After the acquisition was announced in August 2016, the price of USMD stock increased, and Hengen sold his stock, realizing profits of $32,315. His tippees, who also sold their stock, realized profits of $8,340. Six months later, Hengen again misappropriated information from his wife, this time concerning UnitedHealth's pending acquisition of Surgical Care, and purchased stock in that company. After the acquisition announcement in January 2017, the price of Surgical Care stock increased, and Hengen sold his stock, realizing $31,489 in illicit profits.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Minnesota, charges Hengen with violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Hengen consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $63,804, prejudgment interest of $3,865, and a civil penalty of $72,144.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by David T. Frisof and Darren E. Long, and supervised by Brian O. Quinn and Carolyn M. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTFOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTAU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,Plaintiff,V.JAMES E.

At all relevant times in this Complaint, Hengen's wife was a vice president ofhuman capital at a UnitedHealth subsidiary. As part of her responsibilities, Hengen's wifeworked on human resource aspects of mergers and acquisitions, including the potential effects ofa transaction on employment contracts and the retention of key staff. As part of her work,Hengen's wife regularly received and worked with confidential information about companiesUnitedHealth was in negotiations to acquire.USMD Holdings, Inc.15. In June 2015, UnitedHealth initiated negotiations to acquire USMD. Thenegotiations, which were confidential, continued off and on for more than a year. In March 2016,UnitedHealth submitted a written proposal to acquire USMD, but negotiations continued overphysician and executive team retention and other issues, and the merger was not finalized foranother six months. Hengen's wife was involved in these negotiations and on occasion travelledto Texas as part of them.16. During the relevant time period, Hengen's wife typically worked from home atleast once a week. When she worked from home, she would frequently set up a workstation atthe dining room table.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 4 of 11 17. One morning in June 2016, before his shift began in the afternoon at the aiiport,Hengen, who was in the upstairs bedroom at the time, overheard his wife on a work conferencecall. He heard her mention the words ""USMD"" and ""Dr. House."" Hengen searched the internetfor both terms and learned that USMD was a healthcare company based in Texas and that ""Dr.House"" was Dr. John House, Chairman and CEO at USMD. Hengen knew that his wife had beentraveling to Texas frequently for work, and that her work involved mergers and acquisitions.Based on these facts, Hengen concluded that UnitedHealth was in negotiations to acquireUSMD.18. Hengen knew the information about UnitedHealth's potential acquisition ofUSMD was both material and nonpublic. He knew that it could be profitable to trade on theinformation and purchase shares of USMD stock. He also knew that it would be wrong to do so.For approximately two weeks, Hengen debated whether he should use this information topurchase shares of USMD.19. On or about June 27,2016, Hengen decided to trade on the material andnonpublic information concerning the acquisition of USMD. That day, in breach of his duty oftrust and confidence to his wife, Hengen bought 5,657 shares of USMD stock for an averageprice of $16.33 per share in two personal brokerage accounts.20. Beginning on or about the same date, and again in breach of his duty to his wife,Hengen also tipped his brother and three coworkers, recommending that they too buy USMDstock. Hengen did this because he wanted to provide them with a gift of a stock tip from whichthey could profit.21. On or about June 27,2016, Hengen recommended to his brother that he purchaseUSMD stock. Hengen told his brother that there likely would be a merger between USMD andCASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 5 of 11 UnitedHealth. On June 27,2016, acting on this tip, Hengen's brother purchased 300 shares ofUSMD stock for $16.19 per share.22. On or about June 27,2016, Hengen recommended to Coworker 1 that he purchaseUSMD stock. On June 28, Coworker 1 bought 100 shares of USMD for $16.83 per share. OnJune 30, Coworker 1 bought an additional 350 shares of USMD for $18.75 per share.23. On or before July 11,2016, Hengen saw Coworker 2 at work and recommendedto him that he buy USMD stock. On July 11,2016, Coworker 2, intending to buy 1,000 shares ofUSMD, mistakenly bought just 1 share of USMD for $17.50. On August 29,2016, Coworker 2bought the remaining 999 shares of USMD at $20.45 per share.24. On or before July 13,2016, Hengen recommended to Coworker 3 that he buystock in USMD. On July 13,2016, Coworker 3 bought 100 shares of USMD for $18.02per share.25. In July and August 2016, Hengen attempted to obtain updated information aboutthe status of the acquisition from his wife. He paid attention to her work phone calls that hecould overhear, and he asked how her work was going and whether her recent business trips toTexas had been successful. Hengen concluded from her responses that work was going well andthat the acquisition negotiations were progressing. By late August Hengen expected theacquisition to be announced within a few weeks.26. Through August 2016, Hengen continued to trade on material nonpublicinformation concerning the acquisition of USMD. On August 5,2016, Hengen sold 2,557 sharesof USMD stock for $19.90 per share. On August 16, Hengen purchased 2,000 shares for $20.01per share. On August 26, he purchased another 400 shares at $20.33 per share.

Hengen also continued tipping material nonpublic information concerning theimpending acquisition to his brother and coworkers throughout July and August 2016, and theycontinued purchasing additional shares of USMD.28. For example, in a text message exchange on July 22,2016, Hengen toldCoworker 1 to ""Hang on to usmd"" because ""Good news coming soon."" The next month, in a textmessage exchange on August 26,2016, Hengen told Coworker 1 that ""Big news [is] comingsoon for usmd"" and to ""Make sure u have usmd before market close."" That same day, Coworker1 bought an additional 1,000 shares of USMD for $20.43 per share.29. Between July 25 and August 19,2016, Coworker 3 bought an additional400 shares of USMD, at prices ranging from $19.99 to $20.77 per share. On August 26,2016,Hengen's brother bought an additional 50 shares of USMD for $20.33 per share.30. On August 30,2016, before the market opened, UnitedHealth and USMDannounced that they had reached an agreement whereby UnitedHealth would acquire USMD.Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of USMD would receive $22.34 per share. Thatday, after the public announcement of the acquisition, the market price of USMD stock increasedmore than 8% on heavy trading and closed at a price of $22.18 per share.31. That day, after the acquisition announcement, Hengen sold 5,500 shares ofUSMD stock for $22.16 per share. Hengen later received $22.34 for his remaining 46 shares ofUSMD stock, which he held through the close of the acquisition on October 3,2016. Hengen'sillicit profits from trading in USMD stock totaled $32,315.32. Hengen's brother and coworkers sold all of their shares of USMD stock onAugust 30 and August 31,2016. Their combined profits from trading on Hengen's unlawful tipstotaled $8,340.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 7 of 11 Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc.33. In late July 2016, UnitedHealth entered into negotiations to acquire Surgical Care.Negotiations were put on hold in September 2016 and then resumed in December 2016. By lateDecember 2016, UnitedHealth bad taken substantial steps towards commencement of a tenderoffer for Surgical Care securities. These included a meeting on December 16 between the CEOsof UnitedHealth and Surgical Care at which they reached agreement on major terms of theproposed acquisition (including the per share acquisition price), the execution of a confidentialityagreement on December 19, and due diligence work.34. Hengen's wife was informed of UnitedHealth's potential acquisition of SurgicalCare on December 20,2016. She participated in two conference calls about the potentialacquisition on December 21 and 22,2016.35. On or about December 27,2016, on a day Hengen's wife was working fromhome, Hengen walked through the dining room where his wife was working. She was not in theroom at that moment. Hengen opened his wife's notebook that was on the table and sawreferences to Surgical Care Affiliates. Knowing that his wife worked on corporate acquisitionsfor UnitedHealth, Hengen concluded that UnitedHealth likely was in negotiations to acquire thecompany referenced in his wife's notebook. Hengen knew this information was both materialand nonpublic, and that it was wrong for him to trade on it.36. In breach of his duty to his wife, Hengen traded on the material nonpublicinformation he misappropriated from his wife concerning UnitedHealth's potential acquisition ofSurgical Care. Between December 27 and December 30,2016, Hengen purchased in his personalaccounts a total of 3,160 shares of Surgical Care stock, at an average purchase price of $46.54per share.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 8 of 11 37.

13,13,"The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged a California-based software consultant with insider trading based on material, nonpublic information he misappropriated from his brother, an executive at Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc., an Illinois-based healthcare company.

The SEC alleges that Slobodan Dragojlovic misappropriated from his brother material, nonpublic information that Surgical Care Affiliates was in negotiations to be acquired by UnitedHealth Group, Inc. According to the complaint, Dragojlovic purchased Surgical Care stock after his brother told him in confidence of the pending acquisition at a family holiday party in December 2016. After the acquisition was announced on January 9, 2017, Surgical Care's stock price increased, and Dragojlovic sold his stock, realizing illicit profits of more than $20,000.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Central District of California, charges Dragojlovic with violations the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Dragojlovic consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $20,101, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $20,101.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by David T. Frisof and Darren E. Long, and supervised by Brian O. Quinn and Carolyn M. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","  1 2

COMMISSION Case 2:18-cv-09456   Document 1   Filed 11/07/18   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:7"
16,16,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against an international securities dealer and its Austria-based CEO for allegedly violating the federal securities laws in connection with security-based swaps funded with bitcoins.

According to the SEC's complaint, 1pool Ltd. a/k/a 1Broker, registered in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and its CEO Patrick Brunner solicited investors from the United States and around the world to buy and sell security-based swaps. Investors could open accounts by simply providing an email address and a user name - no additional information was required - and could only fund their account using bitcoins. The SEC alleges that a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity, successfully purchased several security-based swaps on 1Broker's platform from the U.S. despite not meeting the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws. The SEC also alleges that Brunner and 1Broker failed to transact its security-based swaps on a registered national exchange, and failed to properly register as a dealer.

The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges 1Broker and Brunner with violating registration provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 5(e) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 6(l) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties. In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced charges against 1Broker arising from similar conduct.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Hirsch and Morgan Ward Doran, and supervised by Scott Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Chris Davis and supervised by B. David Fraser. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the CFTC.

Note: This litigation release was amended on November 21, 2019, to clarify the SEC's charges."," IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (

Defendant
s 1pool Ltd. a.k.a. 1Broker (ﬁ1Brokerﬂ) and Patrick Brunner (ﬁBrunnerﬂ) (collectively, 
ﬁDefendantsﬂ)
, alleges:
 SUMMARY
 1. From at least 2012 until September 2018, 
the 
Defendants have illegally offer
ed and sold
 security
-based swaps to U.S. investors
 through their website 1broker.com
 while failing 
to file a registration statement with the SEC
.  As 1Broker™s CEO
 and sole shareholder, 
Brunner
 controls 1Broker and its operations
.  He is also the developer of the 1broker.com platform.
 2. On the 1broker.com website, the 
Defendants market the security
-based swaps as 
ﬁCFDsﬂ
Šwhich is an acronym for ﬁcontracts for 
difference
.ﬂ  Through 
the
se CFD
s, 1Broker 
accountholders can participate in the price movements of 
securities and other assets
 without 
actually owning the underlying asset.  
For example, an accountholder can purchase a long or 
short position in 
a CFD that 
tracks the price of 
the stock of 
a publicly
-traded 
U.S. company
.  Then, depending on whether the stock price goes up or down, the value of the CFD will also go

 up or down.  1Broker is the counterparty on every CFD
, meaning
 it takes
 the opposite position
 of the accountholder on 
every CFD
.  For example,
 if the accountholder takes a long position, 
1Broker takes the corresponding short position
. 3. Because the value
s of the CFD
s are
 tied to 
the value
s of underlying securities,
 market indices, or other financial as
sets or benchmarks,
 they are 
security
-based swaps
 under
 the 
federal securities laws.  
Absent certain exceptions (which do not apply here), t
he federal 
securities laws require 
that 
offerings in security
-based swaps be registered with the SEC and 
that 
the 
transaction
s be executed 
on a 
registered 
national exchange
.  Likewise, 1Broker
Šwhich 
acted as a dealer in the CFDs
Šwas required to register with the SEC.  Because neither the 
CFDs nor 1Broker was registered
 and because the transactions were not executed on
 a national 
exchange,
 the Defendants violated the federal securities
 laws
.  Brunner, 
who controlled
 1Broker
 and directed its activities
, was a culpable participant in 1Broker™s violations.
  JURISDICTION AND VENUE
 4. The 
SEC
 brings this action under Section 20

. PARTIES
 8. Plaintiff 
SEC
 is an agency of the United States of America charged with 
enforcing the federal securities laws.
 9. Defendant 
Brunner, age 2
6, resides principally in Austria.  He 
is 
1Broker™s CEO, 
sole shareholder, and the only person authorized to represent the company.   
He also developed 
1Broker™s software platform.
 10. Defendant 
1Broker is a limited liability company registered as 1pool Ltd. in the 
Republic of the 
Marshall Islands.  Although the entity was registered in 2015, Brunner and 
1Broker have utilized and maintained the 
1broker.com 
website since 2012.
 FACTS
 A. The Defendants offer 
security
-based swaps
 to U.S. investors
. 11. Since at least 2012, the Defendants have offered CFDs through the
ir 1broker.com 
website
, which 
is publicly available 
to anyone 
in the U.S
. with internet access.
  Using the 
website
, a person 
can op
en an account by simply providing
 an email address
 and creating a user 
name
.  Accountholders are not required to provide 
any 
additional information
Šsuch as full legal 
name, address, purpose of account, source of funds, etc.
 12. In order to buy and sell CFDs, 
accountholder
s must
 first 
fund their accounts.  
Only one form of funding is accepted
Šthe digital currency Bitcoin.  Likewise, all payments 
made by 1Broker 
to 
accountholder
s are made in 
bitcoin
s. 13. Once 
an 
account is funded, the 
accountholder
 can tra
de CFDs.  
The value of the 
CFDs is based on the value of corresponding asset
s.  These assets include U.S.
 exchange
-listed 
Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 3 of 11 SEC v.

 stocks, commodities, and foreign
-exchange pairs.  As explained on the 1broker.com website: 
ﬁ[u]nlike with options or other complex instruments t
he CFD price is one to one with the 
underlying market.  You can trade them virtually feeless and faster than shares, options or 
futures.ﬂ  1
broker
.com
 also states 
that it provides 
accountholder
s ﬁa selection of various current 
trade rates of certain 
securities
 [–and t]he depiction of these Markets is based on current data 
from the exchanges and is updated on an ongoing basis.ﬂ
 14. When trading the CFDs, 
accountholder
s select whether they want to take a long or 
short position.  Accountholders who purchase 
a ﬁlongﬂ CFD profit if the price of the 
corresponding 
asset or index 
increases.  Accountholders who purchase a ﬁshortﬂ CFD profit if 
the price of the corresponding investment decreases.  
Like 
stocks on 
publicly
-traded 
exchanges
, all purchases and sales of 
CFDs are subject to a bid
-ask spread
Šdescribed as a ﬁone
-time feeﬂ 
that 1Broker collects on transactions.
 15. 1Broker also uses stock exchange terminology and provides 
broker
-dealer 
functionality for opening and closing investment positions.  For example, 1bro
ker.com includes a 
page labeled ﬁMarkets.ﬂ  
Within the Markets page, a
ccount
holders are presented with a series of 
choices
Šincluding Indices, Stocks, Commodities, Forex
, and Crypto.
  Within these markets, 
accountholders can choose to trade 
individual CFDs 
that fall within these categories.
 16. If an accountholder selects a
 stock
 from the menu of choices on 1broker.com, 
1Broker provides 
various information about that company™s stock.  This includes 
the 
U.S
. exchange ticker symbol, real
-time bid and ask prices qu
oted in U.S. dollars, maximum leverage 
amount, a stock price chart, and buttons labeled ﬁLongﬂ and ﬁShort.ﬂ  
1Broker offers a wide 
array of CFDs with corresponding U.S.
-based equities.  
For example, an accountholder 
Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 4 of 11 SEC v. 
1Broker
     Page 
5 Complaint
 considering a CFD in Bank of America Cor
p. common stock would see a screen that looks 
similar to
 this:
  17. 1Broker acts as the counterparty 
on every CFD trade.  This means that when an 
accountholder takes a position in a CFD, 1Broker takes the other side of the trade (e.g., if an 
accountholder tak
es a long position in a stock, 1Broker takes the corresponding short position).
 18. The CFDs are security
-based swaps as defined by the federal securities laws.  
The 
Securities Act and 
the 
Exchange Act define a ﬁsecurity
-based swapﬂ 
in relevant part 
as 
any 
agr
eement, contract, or transaction that is based on
 a single security or the
 occurrence, 
nonoccurrence, or extent of an occurrence of an event relating to a single issuer of a security
, provided that such event 
directly affects the financial statements, fina
ncial condition, or financial 
obligations of the issuer.
  See
 15 U.S.C § 77b(a)(17); 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(68); 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18).

 B. The Defendants illegally offer the CFDs without 
registering
 with the SEC
. 19. In 
order to protect investors, the federal 
securities laws require that securities
 offerings
 be registered with the SEC (absent an 
exemption
).  For the same reason, 
absent a
n exemption, 
securities dealers are required to register with the SEC.  The Defendants failed to 
comply with these registratio
n requirements.
 20. Security
-based swaps are securities under the federal securities laws.  As detailed 
above, the CFDs
Šwhich have their value tied to stocks
Šare 
security
-based swaps
.  They are 
also, therefore, securities
Šand 
may not be offered or sold in the 
U.S. unless a registration 
statement has been filed with the SEC
.  The Defendants failed to file a registration statement.
 21. 1Broker offered and sold these security
-based swaps through 1broker.com.  
Investors from across 
the world
Šincluding the U.S
.Šhad access to the website.  
Although 
1Broker and Brunner had the ability to restrict users
™ access to the website, as they did with 
Austrian investors, they continued to offer and sell 
these security
-based swaps on the 
1broker.com
 platform.  Br
unner 
created the
 platform
 for the offer and sale, and personally 
corresponded with investors about the company and specific aspects of the CFDs.  
 22. U.S. investors 
traded the CFDs
 through 1broker.com.
  For example, a Special 
Agent with the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigation, acting in an undercover capacity (the ﬁUC 
Agentﬂ), accessed the 1broker.com website 
while physically located in Houston, Texas and
 opened an account by providing only an email address and password.  The UC Agent then 
funded the account using bitc
oins.  
Later
, while physically located in Washington, D.C., 
the UC 
Agent
 logged into 
1broker.com 
and bought and sold CFDs that track the price of the common 
stock of Ford Motor Company.

     24. 1Broker and Brunner did not 
determine
 whether accountholders met certain 
discretionary trading thresholds. 
The
 unregistered
 sale of security
-based swaps is legal when the 
sales are limited to ﬁeligible contract participantsﬂ
Šwhich are high
-net
-worth indivi
duals and 
certain types of sophisticated and/or regulated entities.  The sales of 
1Broker
 CFDs were not so 
limited.
  25. Similarly, 
the CFD transactions 
were not 
effected on a registered national 
securities exchange, as required.  Instead, all of the sales too
k place through the 1broker.com 
website
Šwhich is not registered in the U.S.
 26. Finally, 1Broker illegally operate
s as an unregistered dealer
.  The federal 
securities laws require that any dealer register with the SEC.  A dealer is any person (including 
an ent
ity
) engaged in the business 
of buying and selling securities for the person™s own account.
  Although certain exemptions apply to security
-based swaps dealers, because 1Broker dealt in 
                                                 1 The UC Agent took a long position in each of these trades.
  The CFD ticker symbols are: The 
Western Union Company (WU), GoPro Inc. (GPRO), and Ford Motor Company.

 security
-based swaps with non
-eligible contract participants, it cannot
 avail itself of this 
exemption.
 27. Because it participated in every transaction as the counterparty, 
1Broker was in 
the business of buying and selling CFDs for its own account. 
1Broker 
charged a ﬁfeeﬂ on each 
transaction in the form of a bid
-ask spread.   
Thousands of
 accountholders
, including U.S 
investors,
 have utilized 1Broker™s platform to transact in millions of dollars of bitcoin across 
their 1Broker trading accounts. 
 28. In addition, 
1Broker describes itself
 as the ﬁmarket makerﬂ for the CFDs.
 29. Despite the
 fact that it was acting as a dealer, 1Broker failed to register with the 
SEC.  In failing to do so, it violated the federal securities laws.

17,17,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing fraud perpetrated by a registered stock broker and several companies he controlled.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Sean Kelly used his companies, Lion's Share Financial of East Cobb, Inc., Lion's Share & Associates, Inc., and Lionsshare Tax Services, LLC, to raise at least $1 million from 12 investors, including elderly retirees, promising that he would invest their funds in a variety of investment products including private placements and real estate funds. Rather than investing the money, Kelly spent it on personal expenses including Super Bowl tickets, luxury vacations, and cash withdrawals. As alleged, Kelly continued to steal money from investors even after having received an SEC subpoena, and did not show up for his scheduled testimony after informing the SEC's staff that he would show up and ""come clean.""

In a parallel action, on the same day, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Kelly and arrested him.

The SEC's complaint, filed on October 25, 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Kelly with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers of 1940. The SEC's complaint charges Kelly's companies with violating certain of those same statutes, or aiding and abetting certain of Kelly's (or his other companies') underlying violations.

On October 26, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze, temporary restraining order, and an accounting. The SEC seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties against Kelly. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia and the Atlanta Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ATLANTA DIVISION  
   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,                                               Plaintiff,  
  v. Civil Action File No. 
         
SEAN KELLY; LION™S SHARE & ASSOCIATES, INC; LIONSSHARE TAX 
SERVICES, LLC; AND LION™S SHARE 
FINANCIAL OF EAST COBB, INC.,                                                           Defendants.  
   COMPLAINT Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission 
(ﬁCommissionﬂ or ﬁSECﬂ) alleges the following: 
OVERVIEW 1. This matter involves an ongoing fraudulent scheme by Sean Kelly, a 
registered stock broker, and various entities that he operates under the ﬁLion™s Shareﬂ umbrella.  Defendants Lion™s Share 
& Associates, Inc. (ﬁLS Associatesﬂ), Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 1 of 21  -2-Lionsshare Tax Services, LLC (ﬁLS Taxﬂ), and Lion™s Share Financial of East Cobb, Inc. (ﬁLS Financialﬂ) (collectively ﬁLion™s Shareﬂ) are all involved in Kelly™s fraudulent scheme.   
2. Since at least 2014, Kelly, through Lion™s Share, raised at least $1,000,000 from at least 12 investors, promising that he would invest the funds in 

a variety of investment vehicles, such as CDs, private placements and real estate funds.   3. Rather than investing the money, Kelly stole it and spent his victims™ 
money for things like Super Bowl tickets, 
luxury vacations and cash withdrawals.   4. Many of Kelly™s victims are elderl
y retirees, and his victims include 
widows, veterans and people with disabilities. 5. Kelly treats Lion™s Share as his personal piggy bank, and he has transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor money to bank accounts 
he controls to support his lifestyle.  He has also withdrawn large quantities of investor money in cash throughout the course of the scheme, and the disposition of 

those funds is unknown.     6. Emergency relief is critical in this case.  Kelly has continued to steal 
money from his victims even after having 
been interviewed by representatives of Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 2 of 21  -3-the SEC™s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations and then stole even more money after having received a 
subpoena from the SEC™s Division of 
Enforcement.   VIOLATIONS 7. The Defendants have engaged in acts or practices that violated, or aided and abetted violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1), 77q(a)(2), and 77q(a)(3)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

(ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and 
subsections (a), (b), and (c) of Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5 (a), (b), and (c)] and , Sections 206(1) 
and (2) of the Investment Advisers Ac
t (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) of 1940 [15 U.S.C. § 80b-6].  Unless restrained and enjoined 
by this Court, defendants will continue to engage in acts and practices that violate and or aid and abet violations of 
these provisions. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
8. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the 
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v], Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)] and Sections 209(d) and 209(e) of 
Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 3 of 21  -4-the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(b) and (d)] to enjoin Defendants from 
engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint, and transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar 
purport and object, for civil penalties and for other equitable relief.  9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections
 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa], and Section 214 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14(a)]. 
10. Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails, and the means 
and instrumentalities of interstate commer
ce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 
11. Venue is proper in this Court because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act occurred in the Northern District of Georgia and Defendants reside in this district.   THE DEFENDANTS 12. Sean Kelly (CRD#2294170), age 49, is a resident of Marietta, Georgia. He is a registered representative of Center Street Securities, Inc., a registered Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 4 of 21  -5-broker-dealer of securities.  He is the owner and principal of various entities that operate under the ﬁLion™s Shareﬂ umbr
ella.  Kelly has Series 6, 7, and 63 securities licenses.  Kelly held himself out to clients as both a broker-dealer and 

an investment adviser. 
13. Lion™s Share Financial of East Cobb, Inc. (ﬁLS Financialﬂ) is a Georgia corporation that was established in 2007.  LS Financial has its principal place of business at 3535 Roswell Road, Suite 1, Marietta, Georgia 30062. 
Kelly is the CEO, CFO, registered agent and Secretary of LS Financial.  On information and belief, Kelly was at all 
times the sole owner and operator of LS 
Financial, and LS Financial is an alter ego of Kelly. 14. Lionsshare Tax Services, LLC (ﬁLS Taxﬂ) is a Georgia LLC formed in 2009 that was administratively dissolved in 2016.  Kelly used a bank account 
in the name of LS Tax in furtherance of his fraudulent scheme from at least 

January 2017 through the summer of 2018.  
On information and belief, Kelly 
was at all times the sole owner and operato
r of LS Tax, and LS Tax is an alter ego of Kelly.  15. Lion™s Share & Associates, Inc. (ﬁLS Associatesﬂ) is held out to be an entity by Kelly, but its corporate status is unknown to the Commission.  
Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 5 of 21  -6-Since at least summer 2018, Kelly used a bank account in the name of LS 
Associates in furtherance of his fraudulent scheme.  On information and belief, 
Kelly was at all times the sole owner 
and operator of LS Associates, and LS Associates is an alter ego of Kelly. THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME 16. Kelly operates using the ﬁLion™s Shareﬂ umbrella, primarily operating 
through LS Financial. 17. Kelly has been a stockbroker for at least 18 years. 18. He has also provided tax planning, insurance brokering and other financial services during that time. 
19. Kelly solicits customers using a variety of techniques, including 
offering free tax preparation services for veterans and free retirement planning 
seminars in assisted living facilities. 
20. Many of Kelly™s customers are elderly retirees. 21. Since at least 2014, Kelly has been stealing his customers™ investment 
funds. Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 6 of 21  -7-22. The mechanics of the scheme are fairly simple. When Kelly™s 
customers had funds that they desired to invest, he would sometimes have them 

make the check out to ﬁLion™s Share.ﬂ 23. He would then deposit the check into a bank account controlled by him. 
24. Rather than investing the customer™s money, Kelly would spend it on 
things like mortgage payments, Super
bowl tickets and luxury vacations.  He would also oftentimes withdraw large sums of cash from ATMs.    
25. For example, Investors A and B are an elderly retired couple.   
26. Investor A is a veteran, and he and his wife met Kelly after he 
advertised free tax preparation services for veterans.  Shortly thereafter, they began investing their retirement savings through Kelly. 
27. Beginning in 2014, Investors A and B provided Kelly with checks made 
out to Lion™s Share worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for the purpose of 
being invested. 28. Kelly told Investors A and B that the money was invested in a variety of 
private placements, annuities, investment funds and real estate investment 

trusts. Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 7 of 21  -8-29. In fact, Kelly spent most of the money he received from Investors A and B for his own personal use. 30. Kelly provided Investors A and B with fabricated statements purporting 
to come from the companies in which 
Investors A and B believed they were investing. 31. Kelly also provided Investors A and B with fabricated portfolio summaries showing investment values and returns for investments that had not 

been made. 32. Kelly wrote checks to Investors A and B that he told them represented returns on investments they
 believed they owned. 33. Kelly later deposited checks directly into Investors A™s and B™s bank account that he also told them came from returns on investments they believed 

they owned.  34. In fact, the ﬁreturnsﬂ were paid from the proceeds of investment checks written by other victims of Kelly. 
35. Kelly solicited and received a $20,000 check made out to Lion™s Share 
from Investors A and B in September 2018.  He told investors A and B that the 

money would be invested in a real estate investment fund.   
Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 8 of 21  -9-36. By that time, Kelly was aware of the Commission™s investigation that 
led to the filing of this action.  Nevertheless, Kelly did not invest the $20,000 as he represented that he would. 37. The real estate investment trust with which the $20,000 should have 
been invested has no record of any investment by Investors A and B. 
38. Several other companies in which I
nvestors A and B believed they own investments have no record of their purported investments. 
39. Investors C and D are a retired couple.  In the fall of 2017, at Kelly™s suggestion, they cashed in an annuity and provided two checks totaling $25,000 to Kelly.  The checks were made out to ﬁLion™s Share.ﬂ 40. Kelly told Investors C and D that he would invest the $25,000. 41. Kelly deposited the checks in a bank account in the name of LS Tax 
that he controlled. 42. He did not invest the money, but instead he spent it for his own 
purposes. 43. At a meeting in August 2018 with Investors C and D, Kelly provided 
them with a ﬁportfolio summaryﬂ showi
ng their investments.  The portfolio 
Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 9 of 21  -10-summary did not reflect the $25,000 they had given to Kelly nearly a year 
earlier. 44. At that time, when questioned,
 Kelly handwrote ﬁ+25,000ﬂ on the bottom of their portfolio summary and claimed that he was holding the money 

until a suitable investment could be identified. 
45. Investor E is the retired manager of an assisted living facility. 
46. Investor E has limited retirement savings. 
47. Investor E received a large settlement from a lawsuit alleging that she took a defective drug that caused her to suffer and undergo treatment for cancer. 

  48. In total, Investor E received close to $100,000 from the settlement. 
49. In a series of checks made out to ﬁLion™s Share,ﬂ Investor E provided 
Kelly $98,000 to invest.   50. Kelly deposited Investor E™s checks into an account in the name of LS 
Tax that he controlled. 51. Kelly told Investor E that he would invest the money he received from Investor E. Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 10 of 21  -11-52. Investor E trusted Kelly to invest the money in whatever investments he 
believed were in her best interest. 53. Kelly spent Investor E™s money for 
his personal expenses rather than investing it. 54. Investor F has invested a large portion of his retirement savings with 
Kelly and Lion™s Share. 55. In August 2018, Investor F gave Kelly a check for $5,000 made out to 
ﬁLion™s Share.ﬂ  Kelly told Investor F that he would deposit the $5,000 into 
Investor F™s brokerage account for subsequent investing. 56. Kelly deposited the check into a bank account in the name of LS 
Associates that is controlled by him. 
57. Kelly did not deposit the $5,000 into Investor F™s brokerage account. 58. On information and belief, Kelly sp
ent Investor F™s $5,000 for his own purposes.  59. Although the full extent of Kelly™s fraudulent scheme is unknown to the 
SEC at this time, many other checks that appear to be from investors were 
deposited into the LS Tax account and LS Associates account and spent by 
Kelly.   Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 11 of 21  -12-60. Some of the checks from Kelly™s customers appear on their face to have been for the purpose of investing.  For example, Kelly deposited a check from a customer™s closed out 401(k) account 
into the LS Tax account.  He also deposited customer checks that had things
 such as ﬁfor CDﬂ and ﬁfor investﬂ written in the memo line into that account.    
61. On information and belief, Kelly
 has misappropriated more than 
$1,000,000 from his customers over the past four years. 
62. The Commission staff subpoenaed Kelly for testimony during the 
investigation that led to this action.  Kelly™s testimony was scheduled for 
October 24, 2018.   63. During a phone call with the Commission™s lead investigator two days 
before the scheduled testimony, Kelly affirm
ed that he intended to testify at the scheduled time and stated that he would ﬁcome clean.ﬂ  Kelly did not show up 

for his scheduled testimony.

18,18,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges against an investment adviser with a history of violating the securities laws for defrauding his close friends and community members.

According to the SEC's complaint filed October 16, 2018, from at least 2014 through at least 2017, Bruce J. Fixelle solicited investments from close friends he met through a local community organization, telling them that he was going to invest their money in initial and secondary offerings, which he would then sell before the end of the trading day. Fixelle described his trading strategy as safe and successful. In reality, rather than investing these funds, he allegedly used investor money to pay mounting personal debt and personal expenses.

In 2014, Fixelle and a company he controlled, Genesis Advisory Services Corp., were charged by the Commission with violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M. Among other sanctions, they agreed to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of over $1.5 million.

The SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force and Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. Investors can also use the SALI feature to find information about certain people who have had judgments or orders issued against them in SEC court actions or administrative proceedings.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges Fixelle, Genesis, and another company he controlled, Aurora Capital Management LLC, with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains along with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.

The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Janna Berke, Andrew Dean, Kerri Palen, Richard G. Primoff, and Sandeep Satwalekar and supervised by Lara Shalov Mehraban. The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Berke, Mr. Dean, and Mr. Primoff.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office.","    Marc P. Berger  Lara Shalov Mehraban

18 Civ. ___________ 
 
COMPLAINT 
  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commi
ssion (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), as and for its Complaint against defendants Bruce J. Fixelle 
(ﬁFixelleﬂ), Aurora Capital Management, LLC 
(ﬁAuroraﬂ) and Genesis Advisory Services Corp. (ﬁGenesisﬂ), alleges as follows: 
SUMMARY 1. Since at least 2014, and continuing through at least 2017, Fixelle, an investment 
adviser with a history of securities regulatory violations, made 
material misrepresentations to 
investors and used his investment fund, Aurora, 
and Aurora™s unregistered investment adviser, 
Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 1 of 17 PageID: 1 2  Genesis, to perpetrate a scheme to misappropri
ate investor funds.  The victims of Fixelle™s 
scheme were long-time friends and acquaintances, 
whose trust he earned through association in at least one local community group.  To these 
unsophisticated investors, Fixelle touted an investment strategy that consis
ted of buying securities in initial and secondary securities offerings, and selling them before the end of the initial trading day.  He told his prospects that his strategy ensured that he maintained liquidity for 
his clients at the end of each trading day and reduced risk by not holding the securities overnight.  He also told investors that he achieved substantial, positive returns. 
2. In reality, by 2014, Fixelle had suffered earl
ier disastrous investment losses based 
on his trading strategy, and was facing mounting debts and outsta
nding judgments, including a 
$1.5 million judgment he owed to the Commission for pr
ior violations of federal securities laws.  
Moreover, by 2014, Fixelle had largely abandoned any investment strategy at all with his 
investors™ money.  Rather, he was instead usi
ng investor funds to pay his debts, personal expenses, and by at least 2016, to repay at least one other investor.   3. Fixelle never disclosed to 
his prospective or existing investors his personal or business financial problems, or his intention an
d practice of misappropria
ting their funds, until long after they invested with him.  On the contrary, Fixelle 
actively sought to deceive them 
through periodic account statements that he knowi
ngly falsified, and which falsely purported to show positive returns.  Fixelle succeeded in induc
ing at least two invest
ors, ﬁInvestor A,ﬂ and 
ﬁInvestor B,ﬂ into providing him with more 
than $300,000 since 2014 through these fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions.  
VIOLATIONS 
 4. By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, 
Fixelle, Aurora and Genesis, directly or Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 2 of 17 PageID: 2 3  indirectly, singly or in concert, have engaged, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to engage in acts, practices, schemes and courses of 
business that constitute 
violations of Section 
17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 
(the ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment 

Advisers Act of 1940 (the ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1), 80b-6(2) and 80b-6(4)], and Rule 206(4)-8 [17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-8] thereunder. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT 
 5. The Commission brings this action purs
uant to the authority conferred on it by Section 20(b) of the Securities 
Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)], Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], and Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)], seeking to permanently restrain and enjoin Defendants from
 engaging in the conduct, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein, and for such other equitable relief as may be appropriate or 
necessary for the bene
fit of investors.  6. The Commission also seeks a final judg
ment ordering Defendants to disgorge 

their ill-gotten gains and pay 
prejudgment interest thereon and to pay civil money penalties 
pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 
§ 77t(d)], Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)] and Sections 209(e) and 209(f) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(e) and 80b-9(f)] of the Advisers Act. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this 
action, and venue lies in this District, pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), 77v], Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa], and Section 209(d) of the Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 3 of 17 PageID: 3 4  Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)].  Defendants, directly or indirectly, have made use of the 
means or instruments of transportation or comm
unication in, and the means or instrumentalities 
of, interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the 
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein.  Some of th
ese transactions, acts, practices and courses of 
business occurred in the District of New Jersey. DEFENDANTS 
8. Fixelle, age 58, is a resident of Hillsdale, 
New Jersey, and is the principal of Aurora Capital Management, LLC and Ge
nesis Advisory Services Corp.    9. Genesis is a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of 
business in Hillsdale, New Jersey.  Genesis is an
 unregistered investment adviser, solely owned 
and operated by Fixelle and it has one administrative employee.  Genesis was the general partner 
of Aurora, and Fixelle directed all trading decisions (to the extent he made any) for Genesis and 
Aurora.   10. Aurora is a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of 
business in Lodi, New Jersey.  Aurora was established in 2015, and represented to prospective investors that it is an unregistered limited partnership, managed by 
its general partner, Genesis.  
FACTS 
A.  Background 11. In 1992, Fixelle founded Genesis 
Group L.P. (ﬁthe Genesis Fundﬂ), an unregistered investment fund he 
advised through Genesis, with initially approximately $1 to $1.2 
million in investments.  By 2006, his strategy cons
isted of obtaining allocations of initial and 
secondary securities offerings from a network of brokers with whom he had developed 
relationships.  Fixelle™s stated strategy was to buy shares in these offerings, benefit from intra-Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 4 of 17 PageID: 4 5  day rises in trading prices, and then liquidate by the end of the trading day.   12. On May 21, 2014, the Commission entered an 
order (the ﬁOrderﬂ) against Fixelle, Genesis and another entity he controlled, finding that from June 2008 through November 2012, 
Fixelle traded or directed trading that violated Rule 105 in connection with 35 secondary and follow-on offerings.  Rule 105 was enacted to prevent manipulative short selling prior to public 
offerings, and it prohibits short selling securities during a defined restricted period, and then subsequently purchasing the same securities in 
a covered follow-on or secondary offering.   13. The Commission, with the consent of Fi
xelle and Genesis (who neither admitted 
nor denied the findings contained in the Commission™s order): 
(1) ordered Fixelle and Genesis to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any viol
ations and any future violations of Rule 
105; (2) censured them; and (3) ordered them to
 pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of 
$951,060.13, prejudgment interest of $140,488.48 and a 
civil money penalty of $492,394, for a 
total of $1,583,942.61.   14. Fixelle made only one partial payment of $100,000 due under the Order.  On 
January 13, 2016, the Commission obt
ained a final judgment from 
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey agai
nst him and Genesis enforcing the Order.  
SEC v. 
Genesis Advisory Services Corp., et al., 15 Civ. 8181 (D.N.J. Jan. 13, 2016).  Neither Fixelle nor Genesis has made any further payments in sati
sfaction of the Order, or the judgment of the 
District Court.  Beginning in 2014, in addition to his outstanding obligation to the Commission, public records reflect that Fixelle
 has faced hundreds of thousands of dollars in mounting debts. 
B. Defendants™ Material Misrepresentat
ions and Scheme to Defraud Investors 
15. In the midst of this growing financial 
pressure, Fixelle, beginning no later than 2014, began fraudulently inducing investments into
 Aurora, focusing his efforts on individuals Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 5 of 17 PageID: 5 6  whose trust he had gained from long asso
ciations at a local organizations.   16. To at least two of these individuals, 
Fixelle represented (as he had previously when marketing his Genesis Fund), that Aurora™s investment strategy consisted of purchasing 
shares of initial public offerings on the first day of trading, and closing those positions the same 
day Œ a strategy he claimed ensured liquidity, reduced overnight risk, and consistently yielded substantial positive returns.   
17. These claims, as Fixelle knew, were 
false.  In reality, by 2014, Fixelle was 
seeking new investor funds primarily to pay his 
personal and family expenses and debts, and to 
make repayments to former investors, facts he 
never disclosed to these individuals.  Through his deception, Fixelle succeeded in obtaining more
 than $300,000 in investor proceeds from these 
two investors, all of which he misappropriated. 
 Investor A 
18. Investor A is a reside
nt of Bergen County, New Jersey, who met Fixelle 
approximately fourteen years a
go through a local organization, and they became close friends.  
From 2015 to 2017, Investor A invested a total 
of $274,000 with Fixelle and Aurora, and, despite demands for repayment, has received nothing in return. 
19. Fixelle initially solicited Investor A™
s investment by describing his purported 
expansive network of broker dealers, and his strategy of buying securities in initial public offerings and selling by the end of the day.  Fixelle boasted a rate of return of 10% or better to Investor A, and said that the return would 
be higher the more money he invested.   
 20. Fixelle also provided In
vestor A™s accountant with a written summary of his investment strategy (consistent with
 his oral representations), together with a ﬁPrivate Placement 
Memorandum & Subscription Agreement,ﬂ which 
identified Aurora as the investment 
Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 6 of 17 PageID: 6 7  partnership (with investors purchasing limited partnership interest
s) and Genesis as the managing 
or general partner of Aurora.   21. Investor A initially invested $150,000 with 
Aurora, in a series of payments from 
October through November 2015.  At no time before
 Investor A invested with Fixelle, did Fixelle ever disclose to Investor A his prior regulatory violations, his personal or business financial problems, or his intention and pract
ice of misappropriating 
investor funds.    22. Defendants then sent Investor A account 
statements, signed by Fixelle as Aurora™s 
General Partner, that consistently reported steady, positive returns.  Defendants™ statement for 
the period October 19, 2015 through December 3
1, 2015 reported that Investor A™s $150,000 
investment had risen to $152,760 by December 31, 
2015.  The statement Defendants sent for the 
period January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 reported a 1.425% gain for that quarter. 23. In May 2016, after Defendants sent those 
statements, Investor A invested another $100,000 with Fixelle in two payments, and, in 
October 2017, an additional $24,000, for a total 
investment of $274,000.  Defendants sent Invest
or A™s accountant a statement for the period 

January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, which repor
ted that Investor A™s total investment 
had climbed $32,134 in value as of that date Œ 
approximately 12% Œ fo
r that calendar year. 24.  These statements, as Defendants knew, 
were fictitious.  Defendants sent the 
statements to deceive Investor A about the st
atus of his investments and conceal Defendants 
fraud from Investor A, and also to induce addi
tional investments from him.  Fixelle had not 
invested Investor A™s money Œ he misappropriated
 it.  Fixelle used Investor A™s $150,000 initial investment primarily to pay Fixell
e™s sons, or for personal expenses such as credit cards, office rent, and condo association fees.   25. He also used Investor A™s initial $15
0,000 investment to pay his debts, including, 
Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 7 of 17 PageID: 7 8  on November 23, 2015, a payment Fixelle made to
 a business whose proprietors held a $250,000 judgment against Fixelle.   
26. From Investor A™s second invest
ment of $100,000, Fixelle used $20,000 in May 
2016 to repay an earlier investor (ﬁInvestor Bﬂ), and another $40,000 to repay another individual as well.  Fixelle also misappr
opriated another $29,900 of Investor A™s investment by sending it 
to a business operated by Fixelle™s son.  27. Fixelle™s accountant, with the knowledge of
 and on behalf of Fixelle, also sent Investor A™s accountant statements that purported 
to represent Aurora™s account with the clearing 
broker-dealer, as evidence of Aurora™s ﬁunderlying statement of assets.ﬂ  On information and 
belief, however, Fixelle physically altered the broker-dealer™s statements before sending them to 
his accountant, so they would falsely reflect mo
re than $600,000 in assets.  In truth Œ based on the broker-dealer™s records Œ the account held only $48.   28. In early 2018, Investor A made a re
demption request to Fixelle for $50,000.  
Fixelle, stalling, falsely claimed in
 a text message to Investor A th
at he had ﬁput in the request with [his] clearing firm,ﬂ and that the firm wa
s ﬁrunning it up the flagpole.ﬂ  In June 2018, after Fixelle had still not honored Investor A™s redemption request, Fixell
e visited Investor A™s office, and told him that his money was gone.  Fixelle o
ffered to put Investor A™s name on the deed to 
his home and to get a new job to pay Investor 
A back, and also told him that he could send 
Fixelle to jail if he wanted.  Investor A has had no subsequent contact with Fixelle, nor any repayment of his $274,000.   
 Investor B 
29. Investor B also is not a sophisticated
 investor, and met Fixelle in a local 
organization, approximately fifteen years ago.  Before he invested, Fixelle explained to Investor 
Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 8 of 17 PageID: 8 9  B that he engaged in day trading, and thus that he was liquid every night, meaning that he sold 
the securities before the day 
ended.  Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to September 
2015, Investor B transferred a total of approximate
ly $2.8 million to Fixelle for investment in the 
Genesis Fund, $45,000 of which he transferred within the past five years.  Over the same period, 
Investor B has been paid approximately $1.9 
million, with the last payment occurring in 
February 2018, for $8,000.  At no time before Invest
or B invested did Fixelle ever disclose to Investor B his personal or business financial problems, or his inte
ntion and practice of 
misappropriating investor funds.    
30. Fixelle sent Investor B an account 
statement dated September 30, 2017 that 
knowingly and falsely reflected a balance of $902,724.55.  In reality, however, Fixelle had lost 
or misappropriated much if not all of I
nvestor B™s balance in the account.   
 31. In January 2018, Investor B asked 
Fixelle to liquidate approximately $210,000 
from his accounts.  As he did with Investor A, 
Fixelle first attempted to
 stall Investor B, by falsely claiming there was an issue with the clea
ring company, and as a result Fixelle repaid only 
a small portion of Investor B™s investment.  In 
May 2018, Fixelle confessed to Investor B that his money was completely gone, and gave him empty promises that he would repay him from the 

sale of a property or from personal funds that he expected to receive.  Since the days immediately following Fixelle™s 
admission that Investor B™s money was gone, Investor B and Fixelle have not spoken.  32.  In fact, Investor B™s money was gone because, by no later than 2014, Fixelle was 
misappropriating much if not all of his funds, a
nd using them to pay personal expenses and 
debts.  For example, on July 31, 2014, Investor B invested $8,000, which was deposited into a 

Genesis account at Wells Fargo that had a bala
nce of $1,733.  Those funds were co-mingled with 
Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 9 of 17 PageID: 9 10  a $13,000 deposit from another Fixelle entity.  None 
of the money was invested.  It was instead spent as follows:   $4,439 to make payments on personal credit cards;  
 $5,463 to make a payment on a personal loan
 at Hudson City Savings and Loan;  $5,334 to pay Fixelle™s mortgage;   $200 to the ﬁBruce Fixelle Irrevocable Trustﬂ;  $950 withdrawn in cash; and   $2,666 to pay health insurance premiums.   
 33. In addition, some of Investor B™s redemp
tions were paid with funds from Investor 
A and other individuals.  As described above, Fixelle sent $20,000 of Investor A™s investment in 
May 2016 to fund Investor B™s redemption later that month.  In Ma
y 2015, Fixelle sent Investor B funds he had received from another individual 
to partially redeem $20,000 to Investor B.  In 
January 2016, Fixelle again sent Investor B funds he had received from still another individual, 
to partially redeem $40,000 to Investor B

20,20,"On September 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged eBay Inc.'s former Director of SEC Reporting with insider trading ahead of Xoom Corporation's acquisition by PayPal Holdings, which at the time was owned by eBay.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Bryan B. Long, a CPA who was employed as eBay's Director of SEC Reporting, obtained material non-public information about PayPal's impending acquisition of Xoom in the course of his work preparing PayPal's SEC filings. According to the complaint, Long purchased Xoom call options in late May 2015 shortly after PayPal made its initial acquisition offer. Approximately one month later, after learning that the deal was moving forward and could be announced in ""early July,"" Long allegedly engaged in a second round of illegal trades, purchasing additional Xoom call options that were due to expire in less than a month. As alleged in the complaint, Long reaped almost $36,000 in ill-gotten gains by selling all of the options after PayPal announced it was acquiring Xoom on July 1, 2015.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Northern District of California, charges Long with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, pre-judgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.

The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Diana K. Tani and Paul E. Kim of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit with the assistance of John S. Rymas in the unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by John B. Bulgozdy and Amy Longo of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","     - 1 -   COMPLAINT

 and traded 
based on
 material nonpublic information

investment banking representatives to gain a better understanding of Xoom™s 
business.  
 19. On April 17, 2015, PayPal and Xoom signed a non

agreement as to PayPal™s intention to acquire Xoom.  About a week later, eBay and 
Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 5 of 12     - 6 -   COMPLAINT

Pal employees began the financial and accounting review of Xoom and the 
potential transaction.    
 20. In or around late April 2015, PayPal signed a letter of intent with 
Xoom, and retained financial and legal advisors.
 21. As eBay™s Director of SEC Reporting
 and 
a member of eBay™s 
Controllership 
Team
, Long had frequent interaction with 
eBay and PayPal 
employees 
who were working on the Xoom acquisition.

 Buys Xoom Call Options in May 2015
 23. In 
or around the spring of
 2015, Long
 was working on a project 
whereby eBay would spi
n off PayPal into a separate legal entity that would be a 
publicly traded company.  As Director of SEC reporting, Long
 headed 
up 
the effort 
to prepare an amendment to PayPal™s Form 10 
that had been filed with the SEC 
registering PayPal™s securities for pub
lic trading
. 24. In connection with this project, the eBay CAO
, who was aware of the 
potential Xoom acquisition,
 had ongoing 
discussions with his staff
, including 
Long, to keep them apprised of 
major 
developments 
in the business 
so that 
they 
could perform thei
r jobs.  
The eBay CAO communicated information about the 
potential 
acquisitions, including the 
Xoom acquisition
, and other transactions that 
his staff needed 
to
 know in order to
 ensure that PayPal and eBay
 met
 their 
disclosure obligations
 including disclos
ures made in PayPal™s Form 10
.   25. On May 5, 2015,
 members of the eBay
 Controllership Team
, including
 Long, met to discuss amendments to PayPal™s
 Form 10
.   26. On May 6, 2015, Long logged into his online brokerage account 
via 
his eBay
-issued laptop.  Long had 
not logged into this account in approximately 
nine months.

while trading in Xoom securities, 
Long 
logged into this account 436 times.  
   28. The following day, May 7, 2015, Long sent an email introducing 
himself to PayPal™s Director of Finance, who worked on PayPal 
merger and 
acquisition a
ctivities
, and 
who 
was specifically working on PayPal™s effort to 
acquire Xoom.  Long™s email 
stated, in pa
rt: 
 ﬁI figured I would reach out to you in 
your new M&A role with PayPal
.ﬂ 
 Long requested 
a meeting 
with the 
PayPal 
Director of Finance to discuss GAAP
-related issues arising out of PayPal™s 
mergers and acquisitions activity
.   29. On May 13, 2015, Long wire
d $10,000 from his savings account to 
his 
online 
brokerage
 account, which had an existing balance of only $644.
 30. On May 15, 2015, PayPal made its initial offer to Xoom to acquire the 
company for between $21 and $22.50 per share.
 31. Before arriving at work
 on M
ay 20, 2015, Long 
paid a total 
of 
$10,527 to 
purchase
 sixty contracts for 
Xoom call options 
through his online 
brokerage account
.  32. A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to 
purchase the company™s stock at a set price (the ﬁstrike priceﬂ) for a certain period
 of time (through ﬁexpiration,ﬂ which occurs on the third Friday of the specified 
month).  Generally, the buyer of a call option anticipates the stock price will 
increase during the specified amount of time.  If the call option™s strike price is 
above the 
price at which the stock is then trading, the call option is considered to 
be ﬁout
-of-the-moneyﬂ because it would be unprofitable to exercise the call and 
pay more for the stock than if it were purchased on a stock market. 
  33. The chart below 
lists 
the 
numbe
r of options contracts that Long 
purchased in each series and depicts Long™s trades as a 
percentage of total volume 
traded in those particular options series on 
that day:

 35. On the date that Long 
made these purchases, Xoom™s common stock

irst self

     Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 12 of 12"
21,21,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting a planned initial coin offering (ICO), which backers falsely claimed was approved by the SEC. The order also halts ongoing pre-ICO sales by the company, Blockvest LLC and its founder, Reginald Buddy Ringgold, III.

An SEC complaint unsealed yesterday alleges that Blockvest falsely claimed its ICO and its affiliates received regulatory approval from various agencies, including the SEC. According to the SEC's complaint, Blockvest and Ringgold, who also goes by the name Rasool Abdul Rahim El, were using the SEC seal without permission, a violation of federal law, and falsely claiming their crypto fund was ""licensed and regulated."" The complaint also alleges Ringgold promoted the ICO with a fake agency he created called the ""Blockchain Exchange Commission,"" using a graphic similar to the SEC's seal and the same address as SEC headquarters.

Blockvest and Ringgold also allegedly misrepresented Blockvest's connections to a well-known accounting firm, and continued their fraudulent conduct even after the National Futures Association (NFA) sent them a cease-and-desist letter to stop them from using the NFA's seal and from making false claims about their status with that organization.

The Honorable Gonzalo P. Curiel, Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, issued an order freezing defendants' assets and other emergency relief. The order also temporarily prohibits Blockvest and Ringgold from violating the antifraud provisions and securities registration provisions. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 18, 2018, to consider continuing the asset freeze and issuance of a preliminary injunction.

The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Office of Customer Education and Outreach have jointly issued an investor alert on the use of false claims regarding SEC and CFTC endorsements. Additional information about ICOs is available on Investor.gov and SEC.gov/ICO.

The SEC's complaint charges Blockvest and Ringgold with violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions under Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks injunctions, return of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties, and a bar against Ringgold to prohibit him from participating in offering any securities, including digital securities, in the future or making misrepresentations about regulatory approval.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David S. Brown and Brent W. Wilner and is being supervised by Diana K. Tani and Joseph G. Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit, John W. Berry of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and Robert A. Cohen of the Cyber Unit. Assisting the investigation is Robert Grasso of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation is being conducted by Amy J. Longo of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the CFTC and the NFA."," ( ) 1 AMY J. LONGO (Cal.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") \'Ł' 1 ' ' , .Ł , .. ,: "" ii .; Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.1   Page 1 of 30 1 2 1. () SUMMARY Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") brings this 3 emergency action to halt an ongoing investment fraud involving an upcoming initial 4 coin offering (""ICO"") by defendant Block.vest LLC (""Blockvest"") and its founder and 5 principal, Reginald Buddy Ringgold, III, aka Rasool Abdul Rahim El (""Ringgold""). 6 Block.vest, which purports to be the ""first [U.S.] licensed and regulated tokenized 7 crypto currency exchange and index fund"" (emphasis added), claims that it has 8 already raised more than $2.5 million in pre-I CO sales of its BL V digital tokens 9 (""BL Vs""), and that it will raise $100 million during its ICO, purportedly to fund 10 Block.vest's digital asset-related financial products and services. 11 2. Blockvest and Ringgold claim their ICO has been ""registered"" and 12 ""approved"" by the SEC and other regulators, even going so far as to use the SEC's 13 seal to promote their offering. None of that is true: the SEC has in no way approved, 14 authorized or otherwise endorsed defendants, their entities, nor their ICO. 15 Defendants also claim they are ""partnered"" with and ""audited by"" Deloitte Touche 16 Tohmatsu Limited (""Deloitte"")-which they are not. 17 3. To carry out this scheme, Ringgold created a fictitious regulatory 18 agency, the ""Blockchain Exchange Commission,"" or ""BEC,"" which he claims 19 ""regulates"" the ""Blockchain Digital Asset Space,"" supposedly to ""protect"" digital 20 asset investors. But the BEC is not a regulator at all. It falsely conjures similarities 21 to the SEC: its logo is similar to the SEC's; its mission statement is cribbed from the 22 SEC's own; and its offices share the same address as SEC headquarters. The 23 Block.vest website links directly from the BEC seal to the SEC's website. Ringgold 24 promotes the Blockvest offering and the BEC side-by-side, further conveying a false 25 veneer of legitimacy to the Blockvest ICO. 26 4. In reality, defendants have neither the regulatory ""approvals,"" nor the 27 established business relationships they claim. The BL V offering is not ""U.S. SEC 28 2 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.2   Page 2 of 30 () () 1 approved,"" nor approved by any other U.S. financial regulator. The BEC has no 2 affiliation with the SEC, and Blockvest is not affiliated with the name-brand 3 companies whose logos appear in its marketing materials. Investors' assets therefore 4 lack the safety or protections that defendants are falsely portraying in their ongoing 5 scheme to raise money through Blockvest's planned ICO and ongoing pre-sales. 6 5. Unless restrained and enjoined, Ringgold is scheduled to appear at 7 two ""VCs, Angels, Crypto and ICOs"" events in Los Angeles on October 9, 2018 8 and in Orange County on October 11, 2018, where he will likely continue 9 promoting Blockvest and the BEC in order to raise additional monies from 10 investors through his fraudulent misrepresentations and scheme to defraud-11 including for Blockvest's intended December 2018 ICO. 12 6. By lying to investors and perpetrating a fraudulent scheme through the 13 Blockvest ICO, each of the defendants is violating the antifraud provisions of 14 Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section lO(b) of 15 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule lOb-5 thereunder, 16 as well as the securities offering registration provisions of Section 5 of the 1 7 
Securities Act. 18 7. The SEC seeks orders temporarily, preliminarily and permanently 19 enjoining defendants from violating the securities laws; an order temporarily, 20 preliminarily and permanently enjoining Ringgold 
from participating in an offering 21 of digital or other securities or making misrepresentations regarding regulatory 22 approval in connection with such offerings; orders freezing defendants' assets; 23 requiring accountings from defendants; and prohibiting the destruction of 24 documents; as well as disgorgement of defendants' ill-gotten gains and civil 25 monetary penalties against defendants. 26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 27 28 8. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b ), 3 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 30 (! (! 1 20(d)(l), and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(l), and 2 77v(a), and Sections 21(d)(l), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 3 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(l), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e), and 78aa(a). 4 9. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or 5 instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a 6 national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, 7 and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 8 10. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the 9 Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 
15 10 U.S.C. § 78aa(a), because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of 11 conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred 
within this 12 district. In addition, venue is proper in this district because defendant Ringgold 13 resides in this district and defendant Blockvest has its principal place of business in 14 this district. 15 THE DEFENDANTS 16 11.

() 1 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 2 A. Background on Initial Coin Offerings 3 18. An initial coin offering or ""ICO"" is a fundraising event in which an 4 entity offers participants a unique ""coin"" or ""token"" or ""digital asset,"" in exchange 5 for consideration, often in the form of virtual currency-most commonly Bitcoin 6 and Ether-or fiat currency. 7 19. The digital assets are issued on a ""blockchain"" or cryptographically 8 secured ledger. 9 20. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database 10 spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically 11 unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains 12 a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the 13 previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on 14 cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can 15 be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Bitcoin 16 blockchain is an example of a ""non-permissioned,"" or public and open access 17 blockchain. Anyone can download the Bitcoin open-source software and join. All 18 participants share a single view of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is updated when 19 Bitcoin network participants reach a consensus on the validity of transactions 20 under review. ""Permissioned"" or private blockchains are modifications to that 21 model and require permissioned 
servers to be approved to participate on the 22 network or to access particular information on the blockchain. Blockchains or 23 distributed ledgers can also record what are called smart contracts, which 24 essentially are computer programs designed to execute the terms of a contract 25 when certain triggering conditions are met. 26 21. Generally, digital assets issued in an ICO entitle holders to certain 27 rights related to a venture underlying the ICO, such as rights to profits, shares of 28 7 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.7   Page 7 of 30 () (! 1 assets, rights to use certain services provided by the issuer, and/or voting 2 rights. These digital assets may also be listed on online platforms, often called 3 virtual currency exchanges, and tradeable for virtual or fiat currencies. Often, the 4 digital assets are immediately tradeable. 5 22. ICOs are typically announced and promoted through public online 6 channels. Issuers usually release a ""whitepaper"" describing the offering and the 7 terms of the ICO. To participate, investors are generally required to transfer funds 8 (often virtual currency) to the issuer's address, online wallet, or other 9 account. After the completion of the ICO, the issuer distributes its unique digital 10 assets, commonly known as ""tokens,"" to the participants' unique addresses on the 11 blockchain. 12 23. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued a Report of Investigation pursuant 13 to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act that put the digital-asset industry on notice 14 that many digital assets are securities and subject to the federal securities laws and 15 the registration requirements, regardless of whether the issuing entity is a 16 traditional company or a distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means of capital 17 raising, regardless of whether the securities are purchased with U.S. dollars or 18 virtual currencies, and regardless of whether the securities are distributed in 19 certificated form or through distributed ledger technology. 20 B. The Blockvest Pre-Sales and ICO 21 1. Blockvest's purported business 22 24. Blockvest purports to be a financial services company that, using 23 blockchain technology, ""aims to solve one of the biggest problems 
in the 24 cryptocurrency industry-volatility"" as well as the ""problems of trust and 25 custodianship."" 26 25. In or around February 2018, Blockvest issued a whitepaper, available 27 on its webpage, for the sale of BL Vs, which purport to be digital assets issued 28 8 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.8   Page 8 of 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 (! pursuant to a smart contract developed using the Ethereum Blockchain. 26. According to the whitepaper and the Blockvest website, Blockvest is developing four products, which will be funded by its planned ICO: a. ""Blockvest30"": purportedly a cryptocurrency index fund managed by BIG, using a ""proprietary trading strategy for trading all asset classes·"" ' b. ""Yields"": purportedly a digital currency described as a ""stablecoin,"" supposedly linked to the U.S. dollar, and also described as a ""digidend;"" c. The ""Blockvest Interface"": purportedly an automated ""investment portfolio structuring and management"" tool; and d. The ""Blockvest Decentralized Exchange"" or ""DEX"": purportedly ""a Bloomberg for crypto economics"" on which BL V holders will have the ability to track digital asset prices, follow market news, and acquire and sell digital assets through other ""major cryptocurrency exchanges."" 27. Based on Blockvest's website, none of the foregoing products are yet operational; Blockvest showed a demo version of the DEX at an August 2018 digital assets conference. 28. Blockvest's website and whitepaper reflect that it will receive certain services from BIG, Rosegold, and MIG. 2. Defendants' promotions and sales of the BL Vs 29. Blockvest first issued BL Vs, priced at $1 per token, in a transfer dated March 30, 2018. 30. Since March 30, 2018, Blockvest has been conducting BLV sales in 26 two tranches: (1) a ""private sale"" with a 50o/o bonus that ran through April 30, 27 2018; and (2) an ongoing ""pre-ICO"" or ""Testing the Waters Phase"" with a 20% 28 9 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.9   Page 9 of 30 (! \ ( I 1 bonus from July 1, 2018 through October 6, 2018. These sales lead up to a ""global 2 ICO"" that is planned for December 1, 2018. 3 31. Between early 2018 and the present, Blockvest also has conducted 4 several ""bounty programs,"" giving BL Vs in exchange for favorable social media 5 posts 
concerning the company, which have been advertised on Blockvest's social 6 media accounts. 7 32. According to Blockvest's website and whitepaper, Blockvest has 8 capped the supply of BL Vs at 100 million, with plans to issue 50 million of the 9 tokens during the pre-ICO and ICO. 10 33. Also according to the website and whitepaper, the company will issue 11 32.5 million of the tokens to investors, setting aside 10 million for management, 5 12 million for ""Core Activities Reserves,"" and 2.5 million for promotional incentives. 13 34. The company also claims on its website and whitepaper that it is 14 planning an initial public offering, or IPO, (separate from the ICO) of unspecified 15 securities in 2019. 16 35. Since early 2018, Blockvest has been promoting its pre-ICO and ICO 17 through Blockvest's whitepaper, the websites for Blockvest, BIG, and Ringgold, 18 and social media accounts held by Blockvest and Ringgold. 19 36. Also since early 2018, Ringgold has been appearing at various 20 blockchain conferences to tout Blockvest, and posting videos of these appearances 21 online. 22 37. On or about May 8, 2018, Blockvest claimed on social media 23 channels to have raised $2.5 million through the sale of BL Vs, within seven days 24 of the commencement of the pre-ICO sales. 25 38. By on or about September 17, 2018, Blockvest represented on its 26 website that it had sold 18% of the BL Vs being offered, or roughly 9 million 27 tokens. 28 10 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.10   Page 10 of 30 (! ( ) 1 39. Ethereum Blockchain data reflects that between March 30 and 2 September 26, 2018, Blockvest issued over 10 million tokens in 266 transfers. 3 4 3. Blockvest's and Ringgold's concessions that BL Vs are securities 5 40. Blockvest's Form D filing with the SEC, its promotional materials, 6 and Ringgold's public statements reflect defendants' understanding that BL Vs are 7 securities. 8 41. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act, any offer or sale of a security 9 must either be registered with the SEC or meet an exemption. Securities Act 10 Regulation D [17 C.F.R. §§ 230.500 et seq.] provides a number of exemptions 11 from the registration requirements, allowing some companies to offer and sell their 12 securities without having to register the offering with the SEC. 13 42. When relying on such an exemption, companies must file what is 14 known as a ""Form D"" after they first sell their securities. Form Dis a brief notice 15 that includes basic information about the company and the offering. 16 43. One of the exemptions provided for in Regulation D, Rule 506(c), 17 provides that a company can broadly solicit and generally advertise the offering 18 and still be deemed to be in compliance with the exemption's requirements if: (1) 19 the investors in the offering are all accredited investors; and (2) the company takes 20 reasonable steps to verify that the investors are accredited investors. 21 44. On April 16, 2018, Blockvest filed a Form D for a $100 million dollar 22 securities offering of BL Vs, claiming an exemption from registration under 23 Securities Act Regulation D, Rule 506( c ). 24 45. On information and belief, Blockvest does not take reasonable steps to 25 ensure that BL V investors are accredited. 26 46. Although Blockvest filed a Form D with the SEC for a Regulation D 27 registration exemption, its website instead invokes Securities Act Regulation A. 28 11 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.11   Page 11 of 30 (! () 1 47. SEC Regulation A [17 C.F.R. §§ 230.251 et seq.] constitutes an 2 exemption from Section 5 registration and is limited to eligible issuers as defined 3 in the regulation. On March 25, 2015, the SEC amended Regulation A pursuant to 4 Section 401 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of2012 [15 U.S.C. 5 § 
77c(b)(2)-(5)). Section 401 directed the SEC to adopt rules expanding the 6 previous Regulation A by, among other things, exempting public offerings of up to 7 $50 million annually (Regulation A, as amended, is commonly known as 8 ""Regulation A+""). 9 48. Under Regulation A, issuers must comply with different regulatory 10 requirements depending on whether the offering is a Tier 1 offering for up to $20 11 million in proceeds or a Tier 2 offering for up to $50 million. In either case, no sale 12 of a security may occur under Regulation A until ( 1) the issuer has filed an offering 13 statement on Form 1-A with the Commission and (2) the Commission has issued a 14 notice of qualification. 15 49. Block.vest's website states (falsely) that ""[t]he company is now SEC 16 Reg A+ compliant and can offer their securities offering to Unaccredited 17 Investors all over the globe."" (Emphasis added.) 18 50. Likewise, on or about June 23, 2018, Ringgold claimed during a 19 presentation at the ""Blockchain Economic Forum"" (""BE Forum""), a video of 20 which he posted online, ""Since we got our Reg A, we are able to take on investors 21 from pretty much everywhere for any amount. They don't have to be accredited."" 22 (Emphasis added.) 23 51. Blockvest has not filed a Form 1-A offering statement for a 24 Regulation A securities offering, nor has any offering been qualified by SEC staff 25 as required by Regulation A. 26 52. On or about July 29, 2018, Ringgold stated during a presentation at 27 the ""Digital Currency Con"" (""DC Con""), a video of which he posted online: ""The 28 12 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.12   Page 12 of 30 (! (! 1 SEC says it's a security so we registered with the SEC."" 2 4. Representations regarding expected profits and income 3 from the efforts of Blockvest, BIG, and their management 4 53. Blockvest's whitepaper and online materials represent that the 5 Blockvest30 and other Blockvest products and services will provide returns based 6 on the purported skill ofBlockvest's and BIG's management. 7 54. For example, Blockvest's website and other online materials highlight 8 the supposed decades of financial industry experience of a 21-person management 9 team. 10 55. In particular, the posted biography for ""Prof. Ringgold"" claims he 11 ""[ o ]verses all aspects of operations and important strategic decisions for [BIG]."" 12 56. Blockvest's Facebook page claims Ringgold has ""over 17+ years of 13 experience in the financial markets and has been a full-time financial trader for 14 several years trading the European, US and Asian markets."" (The post does not 15 allude to Ringgold's age, which is 34). 16 57. Blockvest's whitepaper emphasizes BIG's ""proprietary trading 17 strategy"" as the driver of steady profits for the Blockvest30, and states that 18 ""Blockchain Investments targets returns between 12% to 25% per annum."" 19 58. Blockvest' s online materials also promise that BL V holders will share 20 in the profits of the Blockvest30 and other ventures. 21 59. For example, Blockvest's whitepaper states, ""As a Blockvest token 22 holder, your Blockvest will generate a pro-rated share of50% of the profit 23 generated quarterly as well as fees for processing transactions."" 24 60. The whitepaper also states that, ""The BL V token is a novel 25 decentralized asset, whose intrinsic value is derived from the fees generated in the 26 network it collateralizes as well as the right to receive quarterly earnings from the 27 performance of the Blockchain Investments Fund."" 28 13 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.13   Page 13 of 30 () ( ) 1 61. Blockvest's website states that ""[s]imilar to a mutual fund, BlockVest 2 [sic] is a closed-end hybrid fund with a profit-sharing smart contract that pays 3 quarterly digital dividends."" 4 62. Next to the logo for Vanguard Investments (""Vanguard""), which was 5 used without the knowledge or permission of Vanguard, Blockvest's website states 6 that, ""Similar to a mutual fund[,] Blockvest is a closed-end hybrid fund with a 7 profit-sharing smart contract that pays quarterly digital dividends."" 8 63. Further, Blockvest' s promotional materials state that BL V investors 9 will earn ""passive"" income simply by holding their BL Vs in Blockvest's digital 10 wallets, referred to as ""Investomodes"" or ""Nvestnodes."" 11 64. For example, Blockvest's website states: ""Blockvest Nvestnodes 12 generate passive income through asset backed profit sharing smart contracts .... 13 The company is proud to introduce the Token-As-Fund business model, which 14 allows investors to subscribe to the fund's income stream."" 15 65. According to the Blockvest website, ""Simply holding 1000 BL V in an 16 Nvestnode generates passive income thru [sic] fees."" 17 18 c. Defendants' Material Misrepresentations and Omissions 1. False claims regarding regulatory approvals 19 66. Blockvest and Ringgold are falsely representing to investors that 20 Blockvest, the 
ICO, the Blockvest30, and/or the Blockvest DEX, have obtained· 21 regulatory ""approval,"" most notably misleading potential investors that Blockvest 22 and its ICO are ""approved"" by the SEC. 23 67. A reasonable investor in the Blockvest offering would consider 24 important the truth about the regulatory and registration status ofBlockvest, its 25 affiliates, and its ICO. 26 a. False claims regarding SEC ""approval"" 27 68. Since the Blockvest whitepaper was issued in February 2018 and 28 14 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.14   Page 14 of 30 () () 1 continuing through the present, Blockvest and Ringgold have falsely stated on 2 numerous instances that Blockvest, its planned products, or the ICO are 3 ""approved"" by the SEC. 4 69. Blockvest's whitepaper describes its ICO as an ""SEC Reg A+ 5 Securities Offering Approved."" (Emphasis added.) 6 70. Blockvest's website falsely states that: ""Blockvest is a U.S. SEC 7 approved platform that doubles as a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange as 8 well as a hedge fund."" (Emphasis added.) 9 71. Blockvest's public Facebook page likewise falsely states that: 10 ""Blockvest is a U.S. SEC approved platform .... "" (Emphasis added.) 11 72. Blockvest's website additionally reflects as a milestone in its 12 development the following: ""Blockvest DEX GETS SEC REG A+ APPROVAL 13 & PLANS TO 'TEST THE WATERS' WITH IPO."" (Emphasis added.) 14 73. In or about June 2018, Ringgold falsely stated at a blockchain 15 conference, the BE Forum: ""Good news, we just got our Reg A approval from the 16 SEC."" (Emphasis added.) 17 74. In or about July 2018, Ringgold falsely stated at another blockchain 18 conference, the DC Con: ""The SEC says it's a security so we registered with the 19 SEC' (emphasis added) and that: 20 ""Now, we have the 'JCO' -JOBS Crypto Offering -... a 21 combination of Reg A, Reg A+, a little sprinkle of Reg S. 22 It keeps you out [of] 'Reg Jail.""' 23 75. Blockvest, BIG, and Ringgold are not registered with the SEC in any 24 capacity. 25 76. The BL V offering, the Blockvest30, and the Blockvest DEX are not 26 registered with or ""approved"" by the SEC. 27 28 15 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.15   Page 15 of 30 (! (! 1 b. False claims regarding other regulatory approvals 2 77. Blockvest and Ringgold also are making numerous misleading 3 statements about supposed CFTC and National Futures Association (""NFA"") 4 approval, despite the NF A issuing a cease-and-desist letter to Blockvest on June 5 26, 2018. 6 78. The NF A is the industrywide, self-regulatory organization for the 7 United States derivatives industry. The NF A is designated by the CFTC as a 8 registered futures association. The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, 9 requires certain firms and individuals that conduct business in the derivatives 10 industry to register with the CFTC. CFTC regulations also require, with few 11 exceptions, CFTC-registered firms and individuals to be NF A members. The 12 CFTC has delegated registration responsibility to NF A. 13 79. Blockvest's website falsely states that: '""Under the helpful eye of the 14 CFTC and NF A, we look forward to providing certain qualified investors access 15 to this evolving market', the Fund will be managed by Blockchain Investment 16 Group, LLP, a commodity pool operator registered with the [CFTC] and a member 17 of the [NF A]."" (Emphasis added, internal quotes in original.) 18 80. While Blockvest was registered as a CTA in July 2018, BIG and the 19 similarly-named ""Blockchain Investment Group LLP"" have never been registered 20 as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. 21 81. Ringgold' s website states that Rosegold is ""a CFTC registered 22 Commodity Trading Advisor firm."" 23 82. Neither Rosegold nor Ringgold are registered with the CFTC in any 24 capacity. 25 83. Blockvest's website misrepresents that one of the company's 26 management members-""ChiefMarketing Strategist"" George B. Freeman-is 27 ""licensed with FINRA/NF A."" 28 16 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.16   Page 16 of 30 ( ) ( I 1 84. According to NF A and SEC records, Freeman has not been registered 2 with the CFTC since October 2014 and has never been registered with the SEC or 3 FINRA in any capacity. 4 85. On June 26, 2018, the NFA sent Blockvest a cease-and-desist letter 5 directing the company to stop to stop falsely claiming or implying membership 6 with or regulation by the NF A. 7 86. In particular, the letter demanded that Blockvest remove the language 8 on its website about being ""under the helpful eye of the CFTC and NF A"" and stop 9 its unauthorized and misleading use of the NF A logo. 10 87. The same date, Blockvest's chief financial officer emailed a response 11 to the NF A, stating that ""we intend to take every step to be fully compliant to NF A 12 membership requirements."" 13 88. As of this filing, however, Blockvest had not removed the NF A's 14 logo, the offending language about the regulators' ""helpful eye,"" nor the other 15 misleading representations about regulatory status on Blockvest's or Ringgold's 16 websites. 17 2. Fake affiliation with Deloitte 18 89. Blockvest and Ringgold also are falsely representing to investors that 19 Blockvest is associated with public accounting firm, Deloitte. 20 90. Blockvest's website falsely states that, ""Blockchain Investment Funds 21 will be Audited [sic} by Deloitte, as we plan to use Stratumn's Indigo Trace 22 platform this allows BLV Funds [sic] to become truly transparent."" (Emphasis 23 added.) 24 91. Blockvest and Ringgold also have disseminated online a video titled 25 ""ICO Overview,"" which falsely states that: "" ... we have partnered with Deloitte 26 and have built an innovative cryptographic audit technology."" (Emphasis added.) 27 92. Deloitte has no current or past business relationship with Blockvest or 28 17 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.17   Page 17 of 30 () ( ) 1 any related entities or individuals, including Ringgold, nor any knowledge of a 2 relationship between Deloitte and Blockvest or any related entities or indi"
24,24,"On September 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Russell Craig and his company, OneStep Financial Services, LLC with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws by promising investors profits in return for depositing funds into escrow for the purchase or development of real estate properties, and then misappropriating investor funds.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that in one of the schemes, Craig defrauded an investor of more than $900,000 between 2014 and 2016 and misappropriated over $600,000. Craig misrepresented that the investor's funds would remain in escrow and be used only for the purpose of obtaining a ""proof of funds"" to purchase a condominium property known as the Heritage Condominiums in Atlanta, Georgia. Craig also misrepresented that, after the property was purchased, the investor would receive a return of the principal plus a profit of approximately 30% in a short period of time. Despite these promises, Craig almost immediately transferred these funds to bank accounts that he controlled or to third parties. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Craig encouraged the investor to take out loans to further fund the investment, misrepresenting that Craig would make payments on the loans with his own funds until the real estate transaction closed. Instead, Craig allegedly used the investor's escrowed funds to make the payments.

The SEC further alleges that Craig and OneStep engaged in a similar scheme in late 2017. In this scheme, Craig and OneStep defrauded at least five investors, who were told that their funds were being used for a real estate development project, of $460,000 by guaranteeing high profits and then misappropriating the funds for other purposes.

The SEC's complaint charges Craig and OneStep with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks a judgment against the defendants providing for permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names Peter Baker, Elizabeth Oharriz, Prestige Global Trading, Ltd., and Diversified Initiatives Consulting & Logistics, Inc. as relief defendants, seeking disgorgement with prejudgment interest against them.

The SEC's investigation is led by Christina McGill and Matthew B. Reisig, with assistance from Richard G. Lill, and is supervised by Timothy England and Melissa Hodgman. The litigation will be led by Melissa Armstrong."," Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 1 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 2 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 3 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 4 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 5 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 6 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 7 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 8 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 9 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 10 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 11 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 12 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 13 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 14 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 15 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 16 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 17 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 18 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 19 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 20 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 21 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 22 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 23 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 24 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 25 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 26 of 27 Case 1:18-cv-04539-LMM   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 27 of 27 AO 440 (Rev. 06/12)  Summons in a Civil Action

26,26,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New Jersey-based broker with misusing his access to customers' brokerage accounts to enrich himself and family members at the expense of his customers, many of whom entrusted him with their retirement accounts. The SEC uncovered the alleged fraud with data analysis used to detect suspicious trading patterns.

The SEC filed fraud charges in federal district court against Michael A. Bressman of Montville, New Jersey, alleging that he misused his access to an omnibus or ""allocation"" account to obtain at least $700,000 in illicit trading profits over a six-year period ending in February. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bressman placed trades using the allocation account and cherry-picked profitable trades, which he then transferred to his own account and the account of two family members, while placing unprofitable trades in other customers' accounts. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Bressman.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, charges Bressman with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and a related SEC antifraud rule. The SEC is seeking return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, plus interest, penalties and a permanent injunction.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Vanessa De Simone and Charles Riely of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office with assistance from Jonathan Hershaff and Mark Kaplan in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and Hugh Beck in the Market Abuse Unit.

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED   COMPLAINT 
 Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commissi
on (the ﬁCommissionﬂ or ﬁSECﬂ) alleges the following against defendant Michael A. 
Bressman (ﬁBressmanﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ): 
SUMMARY 
1. This case involves a fraudulent ﬁcherry-pickingﬂ scheme carried out by Bressman in 
his role as a securities broker.  From at least 
January 2012 through February 2018, Bressman secretly 
misused his access to his customers™ brokerage accounts to enrich himself and two of his family members at the expense of his customersŠmost
 of whom were ﬁMain Streetﬂ investors with relatively modest investment portfolios.  As a re
sult of his deceptive scheme, Bressman received at least $700,000 in ill-gotten gains.   2. Cherry-picking occurs when a broker, who buys and sells securities on behalf of his brokerage customers, defrauds those customers by 
purchasing stock and then waiting to see whether the price of the stock goes up, or down, before allocating the trade.  If the stock goes up, the broker 
keeps the trade for himself or a set of ﬁfavoredﬂ accounts.  If the stock goes down, the broker puts 
the trades into other, disfavored customer accounts.  In other words, the broker ﬁcherry-picksﬂ the profitable trades for himself or certain favored accounts, while giving unprofitable trades to his 
other customers.   3. To carry out the cherry-picking scheme here, Bressman frequently purchased large quantities of stock using a block trading or ﬁallocationﬂ account (the ﬁAllocation Accountﬂ).  Bressman made these stock purchases without specifying whether the trade was for one or more of 
his brokerage customers or his own personal securities trading account.  Then, Bressman typically 
 2  waited to see whether the price of the stock he 
had purchased in the Allocation Account went up or 
down during the day of the trade (the ﬁTrade Dayﬂ).  If a stock™s price went up, Bressman routinely transferred that stock from the Allocation Account to his own account (the ﬁPersonal Accountﬂ) or 
an account jointly held by his sister-in-law and her husband (the ﬁFamily Accountﬂ).  Most 
frequently, Bressman transferred the profitable trad
es to his Personal Account.  By contrast, if the 
price of the stock went down during the Trade Day,
 Bressman routinely transferred the stock to one 
or more accounts held by his other customers (the ﬁCustomer Accountsﬂ).  
 4. In those instances that Bressman transferred a winning trade to his Personal 
Account, he often closed out the 
position on the same day.  These ﬁday tradesﬂ allowed Bressman to 
immediately lock in his gains.  In those instances that Bressman transferred a losing trade to one or 
more Customer Accounts, he typically held the position in the Customer Account(s) for an extended 
period of time as a ﬁbuy and holdﬂ investment.  Through this scheme, Bressman misappropriated 
profits that should have gone to his Customer Accounts, and avoided losses that should have been borne by his Personal Account and the Family Account.  5. Bressman™s conduct violated various antifraud statues and Commission rules, including Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) and Section 
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) and Ruled 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder.
 6. Based on these violations, the Commissi
on seeks: (1) entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting Bressman from further violat
ions of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws; (2) disgorgement of ill-gotten gains for the period covered by the applicable statute of limitations, plus pre-judgement interest; (3) the imposition of a civil monetary penalty; and (4) 
such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the enforcement authority conferred 
upon it by Sections 20(b) and 20(d)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) & 77t(d)(1)] and 
Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78u(d)]. 
8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d)(1) and 
22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1) & 77v(a)
] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
 §§78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. 
 3  9. Defendant, directly or indirectly, made use
 of the means and instrumentalities of 
interstate commerce, of the mails or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions acts, practices, and course of business alleged herein. 
10. Venue is proper in this district pursuant 
to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act  
[15 U.S.C. § 77(v)(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchan
ge Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa], because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within the District of Massachusetts.  Among other things, Bressman made certain of the 
fraudulent trade allocations while in Massachusetts. 
DEFENDANT 11. Michael A. Bressman (ﬁBressmanﬂ), age 61, resides in Montville, New Jersey, and until recently, worked as a securities broker.  From approximately 2010 to May 2018, Bressman was associated with a registered broker-dealer (the ﬁB
rokerage Firmﬂ) located in Chatham, New Jersey.  
The Brokerage Firm terminated Bressman™s employment on May 4, 2018.  Bressman held Series 63, 
65 and 66 licenses.   
ALLEGATIONS A. BACKGROUND 12. From at least January 2012 through February
 2018 (the ﬁrelevant periodﬂ), Bressman 
acted as a securities broker for more than 60 in
dividuals and families, many of whom had entrusted Bressman with their retirement savings.  Each of these customers held one or more accounts with 
the Brokerage Firm, to which Bressman had access.
 1  For the majority of these customers, Bressman 
was given discretionary trading authority, mean
ing that he could buy and sell stock for those accounts without receiving approval from the 
customer for each transaction.  For his other 
accounts, Bressman was supposed to obtain approval
 from the customer before making a trade on 
the customer™s behalf.  Even in the case of th
ese accounts, Bressman was responsible for entering 
the trades and, absent specific customer instructions to the contrary, could determine the time and 
price at which securities were bought and sold for the customer. 
                                                 1  The Brokerage Firm is an introducin
g broker.  All of the relevant accoun
ts described herein
 were maintained 
by, and cleared through, a separate clearing brokerage firm
 (the ﬁClearing Firmﬂ). Bressman did not have any direct 
relationship with the Clearing Firm.  
 4  13. Each of Bressman™s customers paid the Brokerage Firm a commission when 
Bressman bought or sold securities on his or her behalf.  The Brokerage Firm, in turn, paid Bressman a portion of these trading commissions.  14. Two of Bressman™s brokerage customers were his sister-in-law and her husband, the holders of the Family Account.  Bressman exercised discretionary authority over the Family Account.  In addition to buying and selling securities for the Customer Accounts or the Family Account, Bressman could buy and sell securities for himself through the Personal Account.   
15. Bressman could place trades for the Customer Accounts, the Family Account or his 
Personal Account in two ways.  First, Bressman co
uld buy or sell securities directly in a Customer 
Account, the Family Account, or the Personal Account.  Alternatively, Bressman could make trades 
using the Allocation Account and then subsequently distribute those trades to a selected Customer, 
Personal, and/or Family Account(s).  An allocation or ﬁomnibusﬂ account is a type of account used 
for large purchases of stock or trades in which a broker is purchasing the same stock for several 
different customers at the same time.  Typically, a broker purchase
s stock in an allocation account 
and then transfers the stock to one or more participating customer accounts.  These transfers are 
usually referred to as ﬁallocations.ﬂ  When used appropriately, an allocation account may reduce trading costs, by allowing the broker to execute one large transaction instead of several smaller 
transactions, and ensures that all customers purchasi
ng the same stock at the same time receive the 
same price. 
16. The Allocation Account used by Bressman wo
rked as follows: First, Bressman would place an order to purchase securities in the A
llocation Account using an online trading platform 
provided to the Brokerage Firm and its brokers by the Clearing Firm.  These orders did 
not identify which accounts were participating in the trade (
i.e., which accounts were supposed to receive the 
stock from the Allocation Account after the trad
e was executed).  After the trade was executed, 
Bressman would use the online trading platform to either (a) sell the stock using the Allocation 
Account or (b) allocate the stock from the Alloca
tion Account to one or more other accounts.  
Stock purchased in the Allocation Account could be
 allocated to Bressman™s Personal Account, the 
Family Account, one or more Customer Accounts, or
 some combination thereof.  If Bressman sold the stock directly from the Allocation Account, he 
would later have to allocate both the purchase 
transaction and the sale transaction to one or more 
of these accounts, again using the online trading 
platform.   5  17. During the relevant period, Bressman was the only person who made decisions 
about the trades made in, and the allocations made from, the Allocation Account.  
B. DEFENDANT™S FRAUDULENT SCHEME 
18. During the relevant period, Bressman misused the Allocation Account to disproportionately allocate profitable trades to his Personal Account and the Family Account and, conversely, to disproportionately allocate unprofitable trades to the Customer Accounts.  
19. During the relevant period, Bressman placed approximately 5,000 trades using the 
Allocation Account.  When Bressman purchased st
ock using the Allocation Account, he typically 
delayed making any allocation to another account, or otherwise indicating which account was 
supposed to receive the resulting stock.  This dela
y in making an allocation enabled Bressman to 
watch how the stock performed in the hours after the trade before deciding how to allocate it.  
Bressman then could, and did, make allocations based on the stock™s performance after the trade. 
20. When the price of the stock went up during the Trade Day (a ﬁwinning tradeﬂ),
2 Bressman, on disproportionately frequent basis, allocated the winning trade to his Personal Account, the Family Account, or both.  Most often, Bressman allocated winning trades solely to his Personal 
Account.  Conversely, when the price of the st
ock went down during the Trade Day (a ﬁlosing 
tradeﬂ), Bressman, on a disproportionately frequent
 basis, allocated the stock to one or more 
Customer Accounts.   
21. In a significant number of cases, when 
Bressman allocated a winning trade to his Personal Account, Bressman then locked in his gains on the winning trade by selling the security as a day trade.  In fact, when Bressman saw the price 
of a particular stock go up, he often immediately sold the stock from the Allocation Account, before allocating it to his Personal Account (or any other 
account).  Once his profit was guaranteed, Bressman
 then allocated both the purchase and the sale 
of the stock to his Personal Account, realizing an
 immediate profit for himself and taking on zero 
risk of price decline from such trades.   22. By contrast, when Bressman allocated losi
ng trades to his customers, he did not immediately sell the stock resulting from those losi
ng trades from the Customer Accounts in most 
cases.  Instead, Bressman typically kept these stocks in the Customer Accounts for an extended 
                                                 2  Specifically, a ﬁwinning tradeﬂ is defined as a purchase th
at is profitable based on (a) the actual sale price of the 
stock, if the stock was sold on the Trade Day or (b) the closin
g price of the stock on the Tr
ade Day, if the stock was not 
sold on the Trade Day.  A ﬁlosing tradeﬂ 
is defined as a purchase that was not 
profitable based on (a) the actual sale 
price of the stock, if the stock was sold
 on the Trade Day or (b) the closing pric
e of the stock on the Trade Day, if the 
stock was not sold on the Trade Day.  
Similar rules apply to ﬁshor
t salesﬂ when considering ﬁwinningﬂ and ﬁlosingﬂ 
tradesﬂ and ﬁlosing trades.ﬂ 
 6  period of time as so-called ﬁbuy-and-holdﬂ investments.  While the value of these holdings either 
rose or fell after the Trade Day, Bressman™s fraudule
nt allocations unfairly deprived his customers of 
first-day profits and saddled them with first-day losses.  
23. When Bressman allocated losing trades to the Customer Accounts, he never told the 
affected customers that the reason they had received th
ese particular trades was to help him and his 
family members avoid trading losses.  Indeed, Bre
ssman never revealed to his customers in any way 
that he was cherry-picking profitable trades to en
rich himself and his family members at their direct 
expense.  Instead, Bressman deceived his customers 
so that he could continue to receive both illicit 
profits from the scheme and from the commissions his customers paid him for making trades.  24. In the case of each of his discretionary-account customers, Bressman had affirmative 
fiduciary duties of loyalty, fairness and good faith.  These duties required Bressman to, among other 
things, act in the best interest of his customers when making trading or allocation decisions.  
Bressman violated these fiduciary duties by maki
ng allocations that were based on his own greed and 
self-interest, rather than his customers™ interests.    
C.  EXAMPLES OF DEFENDANT™S 
FRAUDULENT TRADE ALLOCATIONS 25. Bressman™s fraudulent conduct in allocating winning trades to himself and his family 
members as day trades, and allocating losing trad
es to his customers, can be illustrated by the 
following examples. 26. On November 24, 2014, Bressman allocated a winning day trade in the 
pharmaceutical company Baxalta, Inc. (ﬁBXLTﬂ) wo
rth more than $10,000 to himself and his family 
members, as shown in the chart below: 
 7   27. As shown above, Bressman purchased the 
BXLT stock using the Allocation Account in the morning, but delayed making any allocation of the stock for over six hours.  This delay 
allowed Bressman to see how the stock would perform.  Once the price of the BXLT stock (shown in blue) increased dramatically in the late afte
rnoon, Bressman sold the stock from the Allocation 
Account as a day trade.  Once the 
profit from this day trade was locked-in, Bressman then allocated 
the entire trade to his Personal Account and the Family Account.  Bressman™s other customers did 
not receive any allocation from the highly profitable BXLT trade. 
28. As another example, on March 21, 2017, Bressman allocated a losing trade of 4,000 shares of stock in MetLife, Inc. (ﬁMETﬂ) to certain Customer Accounts, giving these customers the 
resulting one-day loss of $4,280.  This fraudulent allocation is shown in the chart below: 
 8   29. As shown above, Bressman purchased th
e MET stock using the Allocation Account in the morning, but again delayed making an allocation for more than five hours.  In this case, the 
price of MET stock went down during the day.  At the very end of the trading day, when the price 
of the stock was still down, Bressman allocated the losing trade to a group of Customer Accounts.  Bressman did not give any part of this losing trade to his Personal Account or the Family Account.   
C. DEFENDANT CONTINUED HIS SCHEME AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PRE-CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT 
 30. In February 2016, the Brokerage Firm told Bressman that he would need to begin complying with the Brokerage Firm™s pre-clearance process for all of his personal trades, including trades that Bressman made in the Allocation Account and then allocated to his Personal Account.  
Under the Brokerage Firm™s policies, ﬁpre-clearingﬂ a trade meant that a broker had to submit a 
form to a designated Brokerage Firm employee indi
cating, among other things, (a) the stock that the 
broker planned to trade; (b) whether the broker planned to buy or sell the stock; (c) the number of shares to be purchased or sold and (c) whether any ﬁadvisory clientsﬂ (
i.e. customers) of the 
Brokerage Firm had a current order for the stock. 
 9  31.  The implementation of this pre-clearance process did not stop Bressman™s 
fraudulent trading scheme.  In many instances, Bressman waited to submit the pre-clearance form until well after he placed the initial trade in th
e Allocation Account.  This delay enabled him to 
continue to see whether the stock went up or down before making his allocation decisions.   
32. In other instances, Bressman submitted a preclearance form indicating that he 
intended to buy a security, but then still allocated the security to his customers.  Specifically, in 56 instances, Bressman submitted a pre-clearance form to
 the Brokerage Firm stating that a particular 
trade was for his own account, and that no customers had a current order for the stock, but then 
later allocated the entire trade to a group of Customer Accounts.  These trades performed 
significantly worse than the pre-cleared trades Bressman allocated to his Personal Account. 
Specifically, the pre-cleared trades allocated entirely to Customer Accounts had a win rate of less 
than 30% and an average first-day loss of 0.49%, while the pre-cleared trades allocated entirely to 
Bressman™s personal account had a win rate of 84% and an average first-day gain of 0.45%.  This 
disparity indicates that Bressman continued to 
make allocation decisions based on the post-trade 
performance of the stock, even after the imposition of the pre-clearance requirement.  
33. For example, at 10:28 a.m. on May 11, 20
16, Bressman submitted a pre-clearance 
form to the Brokerage Firm indicating that he planned to purchase stock in the biotechnology 
company Celgene Corporation (ﬁCELGﬂ) for his Personal Account.  On the pre-clearance form, 
Bressman stated that no customers had a current order for CELG stock and that he was not 
considering purchasing CELG stock for any of his customers. 34. As shown on the chart below, Bressman purchased CELG shares using the 
Allocation Account at 11:30 a.m.  Despite having
 told the Brokerage Firm that this trade was intended for his Personal Account, Bressman did not allocate the trade to his Personal Account.  
Instead, Bressman delayed making any allocation and waited more than four hours to see how 
CELG stock would perform.  During this period, the price of CELG steadily declined.  Finally, after the market had closed for the day and Bressman could see that the CELG stock had closed down, 
he allocated the entire trade to a group of Custom
er Accounts.  The Customer Accounts lost $1,914 
as a result.  Bressman™s Personal Account did not 
receive any of the CELG stock, and therefore did 
not share in this loss, even though he had told the Brokerage Firm on the pre-clearance form that 
the trade was for his Personal Account and that 
he was not even considering the trade for his customers.  10   D. THE RESULTS OF DEFENDANT™S FRAUDULENT SCHEME 
35. During the relevant period, Bressman regularly engaged in the type of fraudulent and self-serving trade allocations described above.  
During the relevant period, Bressman allocated approximately 1,610 trades to the Personal Account and the Family Account, approximately 1,179 
of which were profitable on the first day, for a success rate of approximately 73%.  The vast majority 
of these winning trades Œ 1,070 trades Œ were allocated to the Personal Account.  By contrast, of the 
3,371 trades Bressman allocated to the Customer 
Accounts during the same period, approximately 600 were profitable on the first day, a success rate of just 18%.  36. This scheme allowed Bressman to personally obtain at least $700,000 more than he would have received had he fairly allocated the trades.  Additionally, Bressman™s fraudulent 
allocations to the Family Account caused his fam
ily members to receive approximately $50,000 more 
than they otherwise would have received. 37. In the case of the Personal Account, at least $650,000 of Bressman™s ill-gotten gains 
were attributable to day trades in which Bressman closed out the trade on the same day it was made.  
In total, Bressman made 807 day trades for himsel
f, 92.1% of which were profitable.  Virtually all 
 11  (99%) of these profitable day trades involved inst
ances in which Bressman sold the stock from the Allocation Account before making an allocation, thereby ensuring that the trade was profitable 
before giving it to himself.   
38. By contrast, Bressman™s customers bore the cost of his fraud, collectively receiving 
approximately $750,000 less than they would have, absent Bressman™s scheme.

SECURITIES & EXCHANGE 
COMMISSION Boston Regional Office 
33 Arch Street, 24th Floor  
Boston, MA 02110      "
34,34,"On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy ""Lee"" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. According to the SEC's complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings. In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments.

Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450. The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval. Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock.

The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan. According to the SEC's orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young's investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young's antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Emily Shea and supervised by Kevin Guerrero and Antonia Chion.","      12

 Defendants.  Case No.   
  COMPLAINT
    Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges: 
SUMMARY 1. Defendants Leroy ﬁLeeﬂ K. Y

282. Young falsely represented that he 
would use the investors™ money for 
fees associated with selling bonds or, altern
ately, for fees associated with launching a 
hedge fund, when in reality he simply
 spent the investors™ money on personal 
expenses.  Young also falsely told investor
s that he would pay the promised returns from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offe
rings, which never occurred.   Young said that he could generate returns of ten times investors™ principal investment in 
sixty days.  To date, Young has not paid 
his investors the promised returns nor returned any of their principal investments. 3. By engaging in this c
onduct, Defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ), Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exch
ange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

28Beach, California, and Defendant YCM™s principal place of business is in Carlsbad, 
California. THE DEFENDANTS 
8. Defendant Leroy ﬁLeeﬂ K. Young of Solana Beach, California is the sole member and owner of YCM.  Sinc
e 2014, Young™s only employment and source 
of income has been raising money from inve
stors.  Young is not currently registered 
or associated with any entity 
registered with the Commission. 9. Defendant Young Capital Management, LLC
 is a Delaware limited 
liability company with its principal place of
 business in Carlsbad, California.  YCM has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
10. From January 2013 through Decemb
er 2017, Young and YCM obtained a total of at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme that included material misrepre
sentations and other deceptive conduct.  
Young and YCM sold investors securities and falsely promised investors a return of 
ten times their initial investme
nt in sixty days.     11. Young and YCM broadly solicited investors from multiple states 
through, among other means, emails, phone ca
lls, and the Internet.  Young identified 
one investor using the social network LinkedIn.  The majority of Young™s investors were referred to him by two individuals w
ho also invested personally.  Young did not ask potential investors about their income, net 
worth, or prior investment experience.   12. To induce individuals to invest
, Young knowingly or recklessly made 
numerous materially false statements in 
telephone conversations and e-mails.  Young promised investors a return of ten times their principal in sixty days.  Young told 

investors that he would use their money for 
legal fees or other expenses associated with a bond or hedge fund offering (which he sometimes called the ﬁYoung Capital 
Management Bondﬂ or ﬁYoung Capital Managementﬂ fund), and that he would pay investors™ returns from the proceeds of the offering.  In fact, Young never conducted Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 9   3   12

28a bond or hedge fund offering.  Instead, Young spent nearly all of the investors™ funds on personal expenses, such as dining,
 shopping, and entertainment.   
13. Young further lied to investors a
bout the bond or hedge fund offering.  He falsely claimed to investors that he had partnered with large broker-dealers to conduct the offering.  In fact, Young never partnered with any broker-dealer in connection with any securities offering.   14. Young also frequently told potentia
l investors that he had extensive experience with the type of investment he
 was offering and that it could not fail.  These statements were false and mislea
ding because Young had no prior experience 
conducting bond or hedge fund offerings. 15. For example, on August 12, 2016,
 Young met with Investor A.  Young 
told Investor A that he was raising mone
y to pay legal fees for a $100 million bond 
offering called the ﬁYoung Capital Manageme
nt Bond.ﬂ  Young identified three large 
broker-dealers as ﬁadministrators of the 
bond.ﬂ  Young told Investor A that if he 
invested $20,000, he would receive a return of $200,000 in sixty days.  Young said that Investor A™s principal would be held in
 an escrow account and would be returned to him if the bond offering did not occur.  
Young also told Investor A that he had done many of these types of bond offerings in the past. 
16. In another example, on June 23
, 2017, Young spoke with Investor B over the phone.  Young told Investor B that 
he had recently left a large broker-dealer 
and was conducting bond offerings with his former coll
eagues.  Young told Investor B that if he invested $5,000, he would receive a return of $50,000 in sixty days. 
17. After soliciting their investments 
through material misrepresentations, 
Young provided contracts to each investor.  
The contracts also falsely stated that investors would receive a ten times return on 
their investment in sixty days ﬁin regard to a transaction or transactions,ﬂ without further explanation.  For example, for one individual who invested $15,000, the agreement stated:  ﬁClient will be paid $150,000 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) in sixty (60) days in regard to a Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.4   Page 4 of 9   4   12

rns in sixty days was false.  Young 
did not provide investors with
 any returns within sixty da
ys of their investments and 
knew or was reckless in not knowing that these representations were false at the time 
that he made them.  Such returns would ha
ve been impossible because, rather than 
investing investors™ funds in any security that could have potentially provided a return, Young simply spent the money on hims
elf.  To date, Young has not returned any money to investors.     
19. Based on Young™s (and through
 Young, YCM™s) material misrepresentations, investors agreed to i
nvest in securities that took the form of 
investment contracts.  Sales of securities 
must be registered with the SEC unless an 
exemption from the registration requirements applies. 
20. During all relevant times, Young™s 
and YCM™s offering of investment 
contracts was required to be registered under the securities laws.  Young and YCM™s offering was not registered with the SEC and was not subject to any relevant exemption from registration. 
21. Young and YCM obtained $362,000 fr
om investors by means of their materially false statements and the illegal, unregistered sales of investment contracts to them.   22. To some investors, Young held himsel
f out as an investment adviser to a purported hedge fund, YCM. 
23. Young and YCM engaged in additiona
l deceptive conduct in furtherance of the scheme by funneling investors™ funds through a self-employed attorney working with Young.  Young directed investors to wire their investment funds to a 

trust account maintained by the attorney.  Young told investors that their principal 
would safely remain in escrow until the bo
nd or hedge fund offering was complete.   
24. Young™s representation that investor
s™ money would remain in escrow 
was also false.  At Young™s instruction, the attorney transferred the investors™ money

stors™ money on his personal expenses. 
25. Young™s misrepresentations to inve
stors about his relevant experience and industry access, the safety of the 
investment, and the high returns of the 
investment were material to investors. 
26. When pressed by investors for prom
ised returns, repayment of their 
initial investment, or status updates on 
their investments, Young concealed his misappropriation of their money by making 
more false statements.  Young sent 
emails to investors stating variously that
 he was ﬁin a lawsuit to refund [their] money,ﬂ ﬁgetting very close to getting a re
fund on [their] investment,ﬂ ﬁdoing a 144A Bond Offering in the next 30-60 days which will return 9X your money,ﬂ and ﬁgoing 
to start selling the bonds [him]self to institutional investorsﬂ in a ﬁbond offering now 
scheduled for January 8.ﬂ  At the time 
he made these statements, Young knew that 
they were false.  In fact, there was no lawsuit, there was no planned bond offering, 
and Young was never ﬁcloseﬂ to refunding investors™ money. 
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Connection with the Purc
hase and Sale of Securities Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (Against All Defendants) 27. The SEC realleges and incorporates
 by reference paragraphs 1 through 26 above. 28. As a result of the conduct alle
ged herein, Defendants Young and YCM knowingly or recklessly, in the offer or sale of securities, directly or indirectly, by the use of the means or instruments of tran
sportation or communication in interstate 
commerce, or the mails: 
a. Knowingly or recklessly employed devices, schemes, or artifices to 
defraud; 
b. Knowingly, recklessly, or neglig

38,38,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers - including many elderly retirees and unsophisticated investors - out of more than $2.7 million in a multi-year investment scam.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2014 through 2016, Ernest J. Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC. Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments. Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked. Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false. As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit. He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Romer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Wilburn Saylor of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Steven Klawans. The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Ms. Key-Patterson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Macomb County, Michigan Prosecutor's Office.","  - 1 - UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

____________________________________/ 
 COMPLAINT 
 Plaintiff, the United States Securities a
nd Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges as 
follows: 
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 1. The SEC brings this civil law enfo
rcement action to address Defendant 
Ernest J. Romer, III™s (ﬁRomerﬂ) multi-million-
dollar securities fraud.  From approximately 
2014 through 2016, Romer defrauded at least 30 of
 his retail brokerage customers out of 
approximately $2.7 million.  During that time
 period, Romer worked as a registered 
representative associated with
 CoreCap Investments, Inc., a 
registered broker-dealer with the SEC (ﬁCoreCap Investmentsﬂ).
 2. Romer persuaded at least 30 of his cu
stomers to sell securities in their 
CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer th
e proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC 
(ﬁP&R Capitalﬂ) or CoreCap Solutions, LLC (ﬁCoreCap Solutionsﬂ).  Romer represented to 
customers that upon transferring money to P&
R Capital and CoreCap Solutions, he would invest their money in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current 
Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.1    Page 1 of 10  - 2 - investments.  Based on Romer™s representati
ons, the customers understood that CoreCap 
Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with CoreCap Investments.    
3. Romer™s statements to his customers 
were false.  P&R Capital and CoreCap 
Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no relationship to CoreCap 

Investments.  Romer did not invest the cust
omers™ money in the stock market for their 
benefit.  He instead stole the money for 
his own personal use.  Romer commingled 
approximately $2.7 million of customer funds w
ith his advances from CoreCap Investments 
and other sources for a total of approximately $4.4 million.  Of that, Romer used 

approximately $3.5 million for trading in 
his personal brokerage accounts, paid 
approximately $714,000 to cover his personal 
expenses, paid approximately $343,000 to 
customers of his prior brokerage firms, 
paid approximately $302,000 to customers of 
CoreCap Investments, and transferred appr
oximately $41,000 to family members.   
4. By engaging in this conduct, Romer 
violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.   5. In connection with this lawsuit, 
the SEC seeks a permanent injunction 
against Romer to enjoin him from future viol
ations of the above-cited provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC furthe
r seeks an order requiring Romer to pay 
disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of th
e ill-gotten gains that he received through his 
fraud, along with the imposition of
 civil penalties pursuant to 
Section 20 of the Securities 
Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t] and Section 21 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u].  Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.2    Page 2 of 10  - 3 - JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
6. The Court has jurisdiction over this ac
tion pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa].  Defendant Romer, 
directly or indirectly, has made use of the 
means or instruments of transportation or co
mmunication in intersta
te commerce, or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
 or of the mails, or of any facility of any 
national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 
7. Venue is proper in this Court pursuan
t to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 
U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa] because certain of the acts, practices and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint 
occurred within the jurisdiction of the United St
ates District Court for the Eastern District 
of Michigan.  In addition, during the relevant time period, Defendant Romer resided and 
conducted business within the Eastern District of Michigan. THE DEFENDANT 
8. Ernest J. Romer, III is 57 years old and is a resident of Shelby Township, 
Michigan.  From October 2012 until his 
termination in January 2017, Romer was a 
registered representative associated with Co
reCap Investments.  Romer held Series 7, 63 
and 66 licenses.  CoreCap Investments termin
ated Romer in January 2017 for engaging in 
undisclosed outside business activities.  In July 2017, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) barred Romer in all cap
acities from association with any FINRA 
members.  In August of 2017, the Michigan
 Department of Licensing and Regulatory 
Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10  - 4 - Affairs (ﬁLARAﬂ) revoked Romer™s securities
 agent registration, barring Romer from 
registration with a broker-dealer.   FACTS 
Romer™s Professional Background 
 9. Romer has been a registered representative associated with various broker-
dealers since at least 1993.  Many of his customers followed Romer from broker-dealer to 
broker-dealer.  In 2012, Romer began wo
rking for CoreCap Investments. 
Romer™s Offering Fraud and Misappropriation Scheme  10. In 2014, Romer began recommending that certain of his CoreCap 
Investments customers sell secu
rities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer 
the proceeds to bank accounts in the name of 
either P&R Capital or CoreCap Solutions.  Romer represented that he would use the f
unds to make investments which would earn 
better returns than their current investments. 
 Romer told some customers he would invest 
their funds in a variable annuity and told others he would invest in stocks or mutual funds.  
Based on Romer™s representations, including Ro
mer™s installation of misleading signage 
directly behind the reception desk in the CoreCap Investme
nts branch office where he 
worked that read ﬁCoreCap Solutions,ﬂ th
e customers understood that P&R Capital and 
CoreCap Solutions were affiliated with CoreCap Investments.   

 11. Many of Romer™s customers were el
derly retirees and unsophisticated investors.  They had most of their life sa
vings invested with Romer.  Based on their 
decades-long relationship, the customers trusted 
Romer and agreed to sell securities and 
transfer their funds as Romer recommended. 
Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10  - 5 -  12. Based on Romer™s recommendations, from approximately 2014 to April 
2016, customers sold securities in their Co
reCap Investments account, transferred the 
proceeds to their personal bank accounts, and then wrote personal checks or provided 

cashier™s checks to P&R Capital or CoreCap So
lutions.  Romer deposited those checks into 
P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions bank accounts, over which he had sole control. 

 13. In April 2016, Romer began instructing 
customers to transfer money directly 
from their CoreCap Investments accounts to 
the P&R Capital bank account.  In those 
instances, Romer completed all the required pa
perwork, had the customers sign it, and then 
sent it to CoreCap Investments™
 back office for processing.    14. In total, approximately 22 cust
omers sent $1,962,887 to P&R Capital and 11 
customers sent $738,200 to CoreCap Solutions. 
Romer™s Misappropriation of Customer Funds  15. Contrary to Romer™s representati
ons, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions 
were Romer™s personal businesses and had no re
lationship to CoreCap Investments, and the 
customers™ money was not used to purch
ase securities for the customers.   
 16. Instead, Romer used another join
t checking account in his name to 
commingle the $2.7 million he raised from his customers with approximately $1.0 million 

in advances that he received from Co
reCap Investments, approximately $495,000 in 
cashier™s checks, and approximately 
$242,000 from other sources.  Romer used 
approximately $3.5 million for trading in his pe
rsonal brokerage accounts, realizing trading 
losses, primarily from options trading, 
of about $3.1 million.  Romer also used 
approximately $714,000 of the commingled funds for personal expenses, including 

mortgage payments, credit ca
rds bills, shopping, college costs for his children, Detroit Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10  - 6 - Lions tickets, and cash withdrawals.  Additionally, Romer transferred approximately 
$41,000 to family members.  

 17. From the time Romer began misappropr
iating his customers™ funds, he used 
some of their money to repay other customers 
at one of his former brokerage firms, who 
had suffered losses in a private offering in 2010 and 2011.  Eventually, Romer used 

approximately $343,000 of his customers™ f
unds for this fraudulent purpose.   18. Some of Romer™s CoreCap Investments 
customers requested that he return some of their funds.  He used funds from ot
her CoreCap Investments customers to make 
those payments.  In total,
 Romer made approximately
 $302,000 of such Ponzi-like payments, using money he received from his victims.   
19. Romer never disclosed to his CoreCap 
Investments customers that he would 
use, or had used, their funds for any of the purposes described in Paragraphs 16-18, above.   20. Romer acted deliberately, with the inte
nt to deceive.  He never intended to make the investments he promised to his customers, and he never invested any of the 
money he raised from his customers for their benefit.   
21. As a result of Romer™s false and misl
eading statements, at least 30 customers 
transferred at least $2.7 million to Romer.  
Uncovering Romer™s Fraud 
 22. As early as mid-2015, some of Rome
r™s customers began to question him 
about their investment returns and tax docum
entation.  Romer was unable to provide the 
customers with any documentation relating to 
the investments because none of the money 
had been invested as promised.  Instead, Rome
r told his customers various lies, including 
Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.6    Page 6 of 10  - 7 - that their money was safe and that he was 
waiting for better buying opportunities or market 
movement before investing on their behalf.   
23. Eventually, certain of Romer™s custom
ers complained to the local criminal 
authorities.  In September 2017, Romer was 
charged with embezzlement by the Macomb 
County Prosecutor™s Office.  In July 2018, he pled no contest to those charges, and is currently awaiting sentencing.

39,39,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company's developmental lung cancer drug.

The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug. According to the complaint, the company's investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally. Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent. The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016.

According to the SEC's complaint, in evaluating Clovis' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its ""efficacy,"" or how well the drug worked. In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci's efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company's CFO at that time, showed that Roci's efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent. Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward. In November 2015, after Clovis disclosed the true efficacy, using the methodology required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its stock price dropped approximately 70 percent.

The SEC's complaint charges Clovis with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint charges Mahaffy with violating Section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting Clovis' violations of Section 13(a). The complaint charges Mast with aiding and abetting Clovis' federal securities laws violations. The defendants agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and the settlements are subject to court approval. Clovis agreed to a $20 million penalty. Mahaffy agreed to a $250,000 penalty. Mast agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and to provide disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $454,145, attributable to selling Clovis stock during the relevant period at inflated prices. The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalties to harmed investors.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Cates and Kim Greer and supervised by Ian Karpel and Kurt Gottschall in the Denver Regional Office."," 1  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
  Plaintiff,
 v.  CLOVIS ONCOLOGY, INC., 
PATRICK 
J. MAHAFFY, and 
ERLE T. MAST
  Defendants.
   COMPLAINT
   Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁSECﬂ or 
ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint against Clovis Oncology, Inc., Patrick J. Mahaffy, and Erle T. 
Mast (collectively, the 
ﬁdefendantsﬂ) alleges as follows:
 NATURE OF THE ACTION
  1. From approximately July 8, 2015 through November 16, 2015 (the ﬁrelevant time 
periodﬂ), Clovis Oncology, Inc. (ﬁClovisﬂ or the ﬁcompanyﬂ), a biopharmaceutical company 
based in Boulder, Colorado and li
sted on NASDAQ, and its current Chief Executive Officer 
(ﬁCEOﬂ), Patrick Mahaffy (ﬁMahaffyﬂ), negligently made untrue statements of material fact 
and/or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements they made not 
misleading to i
nvestors about its then flagship lung cancer drug, rociletinib (ﬁRociﬂ). Clovis™ 
former Chief Financial Officer (ﬁCFOﬂ), Erle Mast (ﬁMastﬂ), aided and abetted such untrue 
statements and/or omissions. For investors, Clovis™ value in 2015 was directly tied t
o the ability 
of Roci to compete in the market for lung cancer drugs. One important driver of the
 competition
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 15 2  was Roci™s
 ﬁefficacyﬂ 
Œ how well the drug worked 
Œ and how that efficacy compared to a drug 
simultaneously under development by another biopharmaceutical company, referred to herein as 
ﬁDRUG X.ﬂ
 2. On May 31, 2015, Clovis disclosed to investors at the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ﬁASCOﬂ) conference, that Roci™s efficacy, referred to as Objective Response 
Rate (ﬁORRﬂ), in ongoing clinical trials was 60% for its 500mg dose, meaning that in 60
% of 
patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. That Roci™s efficacy was 60% was material to 
investors, as investors believed that this efficacy rate was almost identical to DRUG X, which 
had a disclosed efficacy rate at the time of 63%. Investors th
erefore valued Clovis stock 
assuming that Roci would capture meaningful market
 share.
 3. Shortly after the May 31, 2015 disclosure, the data provided to Mahaffy, Mast, 
and other Clovis senior executives began to show that Roci™s efficacy rate was materially l
ower 
than 60%. In mid
-June 2015, Clovis™ updated Roci data provided to Mahaffy showed an ORR in 
the mid
-40s. On July 7, 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the Roci data that would be 
submitted in the initial submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administra
tion (ﬁFDAﬂ) for
 Roci™s 
approval showed an ORR of 42%.
 4. While Clovis™ non
-public data, which was used to prepare its submission to the 
FDA, showed an ORR below 60%, Clovis continued citing to the May 2015 ASCO conference 
and its disclosure that Roci™s ORR w
as 60%. On July 8, 2015, Clovis referenced the May 2015 
ASCO conference and the 60% ORR for Roci in the solicitation materials for a $298 million 
offering of its securities (the ﬁOfferingﬂ). After the Offering, Clovis continued to repeat the
 60% 
ORR in pub
lic disclosures.
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 15 3  5. On November 9, 2015, the FDA informed Clovis that it disagreed with Clovis™ 
calculation of the efficacy results for Roci, that an accurate calculation of Roci™s efficacy put
 the 
ORR in the 20s, and that Clovis must provide ne
w calculations to the FDA by November 16, 
2015. On November 10, 2015, Clovis attended an investor conference and referenced the May 
2015 ASCO conference and the 60% ORR figure, but without disclosing that the FDA had told 
Clovis it disagreed with Clovis™ e
fficacy
 analysis.
 6. On November 16, 2015, Clovis disclosed the true ORR, as calculated by the 
methodology required by the FDA, telling the market that Roci™s ORR was 28%. The
 stock 
price collapsed as a result, dropping approximately 70% from $99.43 to $30.24
 per
 share.

13 of the Exchange Act and related rules thereunder. Throughout the relevant time period, 
Clovis issued stock to its employees in connection with their exercise of stock 
options pursuant 
to Clovis™ stock incentive plan.
 10. PATRICK J. MAHAFFY 
is a resident of this district. Since 2009, he has served 
as CEO and a director of Clovis. As CEO, Mahaffy reviewed and approved Clovis press
 releases 
and filings with the
 Commission.
 11. ERL
E T. MAST 
is a resident of this district. From 2009 to 2016, he served as 
CFO of Clovis. As CFO, Mast reviewed and approved Clovis press releases and reviewed, 
approved, and signed Clovis filings with the Commission. During the relevant time period, Mast

-1 plan, at inflated
 prices.
 FACTS
  Development of Roci
  12. There are various types of lung cancer, one of which is referred to as non
-small 
cell lung cancer (ﬁNSCLCﬂ). Some NSCLC patients can be 
treated with a class of drugs
 referred 
to as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ﬁTKIsﬂ). However, many patients™ disease will progress after 
treatment on TKIs because of an acquired resistance mutation called a ﬁT790Mﬂ mutation. As a 
consequence of this mutation,
 patients become resistant to TKI therapy. Clovis developed Roci 
to treat NSCLC patients who become resistant to TKIs due to the emergence of the T790M 
mutation.
 13. Before Roci could be sold in the U.S., Clovis needed to obtain approval from the 
FDA. In March
 2012, Clovis began the Phase 1 portion of a Roci clinical trial referred to as 
ﬁTIGER
-X.ﬂ The objective of the Phase 1 portion of TIGER
-X was to evaluate Roci™s
 safety
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 15 5  and determine the appropriate dose for further trials. The Phase 2 portio
n of TIGER
-X, 
measuring, among other things, Roci™s efficacy, began in February 2014. Clovis publicly 
disclosed that the primary endpoint of the TIGER
-X Phase 2 clinical trial was ORR 
Œ ﬁObjective 
Response Rate–per RECIST.ﬂ
 14. The Response Evaluation Criteria
 in Solid Tumours (ﬁRECISTﬂ) guidelines are 
an industry
-standard set of guidelines used in evaluating the response, measured by tumor 
shrinkage, to a cancer drug. Clovis™ protocol for the TIGER
-X trial required, per RECIST, that 
in order for tumor shrinkag
e to qualify as a response, among other criteria, the targeted tumor 
must shrink at least 30% and the tumor shrinkage must be sustained in a follow
-up examination. 
This latter requirement is referred to as
 ﬁconfirmation.ﬂ
 15. The data from TIGER
-X, and another
 ongoing Roci clinical trial called TIGER
-2 (a Phase 2 study evaluating efficacy that began enrolling patients in June 2014), formed the
 basis 
of Clovis™ New Drug Application (ﬁNDAﬂ) submitted to the FDA. The TIGER
-X and TIGER
-2 data were also going to be 
used to support Roci™s proposed labeling. A drug™s ﬁlabelﬂ is the 
printed information that comes with the drug and includes efficacy data such as
 ORR.
 16. Prior to 2015, there were no approved drugs to treat T790M
-positive NSCLC 
patients. However, concurrently
 with Roci™s development, another company was developing
 its 
own drug, referred to herein as DRUG X, to treat the same group of patients. The development 
of Roci and DRUG X was a race, with analysts and investors carefully comparing Roci™s 
published effica
cy data with DRUG X™s published efficacy data to determine which drug might 
capture more market share once approved by the
 FDA.
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 15 6  Clovis Tells Investors That Roci™s Efficacy is 60%
  17. Clovis disclosed to investors in early 2015 that it expected to submit its NDA to 
the FDA for Roci in mid
-2015. In 
advance of the NDA submission, Clovis told investors it 
would give a preview of its label at the ASCO conference in May 2015. The data presen
tation
 at 
ASCO was also a necessary step to raising capital from investors that Clovis
 needed.
 18. At an investor meeting at the ASCO conference on May 31, 2015, Clovis 
disclosed findings from Phase 2 of TIGER
-X, publicly announcing that Clovis™
 ﬁrecommendedﬂ 
or ﬁgo
-forwardﬂ dose of Roci would be 500mg and that, at the 500mg dose, Roci™s ORR was 
60%. Mahaffy stated that the data ﬁconfirm [Roci™s] compelling activityﬂ and would ﬁform the 
[NDA submission] in July [2015].ﬂ In its ASCO 2015 presentation, the compan
y developing 
DRUG X disclosed that its current 
confirmed 
ORR was
 63%.
 19. The disclosed Roci ORR presented at ASCO 2015 and referenced throughout the 
relevant time period by Clovis was ﬁunconfirmed,ﬂ meaning that the initial tumor shrinkage was 
not necessarily
 sustained through a follow
-up scan. Clovis™ 60% ORR at ASCO included 
patients who had a single responsive scan, but then progressed (
e.g.
, their target tumors grew or 
they developed new tumors) without a confirmatory scan. In other words, Clovis™ 60% ORR 
at 
ASCO included some patients who could never be confirmed responders; some patients who had 
a responsive scan, but had not yet progressed; and some patients who had not had the 
opportunity for a second responsive scan because they had not been on study l
ong enough.
 Later 
analysis of the ASCO data set showed that the confirmed ORR for the ASCO data set at the time 
it was presented was 40%.
 20. In the spring of 2015, Clovis statisticians provided Roci ORR data to Clovis 
senior clinical personnel showing a diver
gence between the confirmed and unconfirmed
 ORR.
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 15 7  Although Mahaffy, Mast and some other individuals at Clovis hoped that the FDA would allow 
Clovis to use Roci™s unconfirmed ORR on Roci™s label, certain senior Clovis employees believed 
that th
e FDA would require Clovis to follow RECIST and its own trial protocols in reporting a 
confirmed ORR on Roci™s label.
 Clovis Gets Initial NDA Data Showing Lower ORR, But Still Refers to the ASCO 2015 
60% ORR In Connection With Raising $298 Million in the O
ffering
  21. On June 19, 2015, Mahaffy and other members of Clovis senior management, not 
including Mast, received the ﬁclose to finalﬂ TIGER
-X data which would be used for the NDA. 
The unconfirmed ORR was 45.1% for the 500mg dose, or 25% lower than the 60% OR
R presented at the ASCO 2015 conference. Mahaffy at the time wrote to a Clovis executive that 
the data ﬁ[s]eem[ed]
 worrying.ﬂ
 22. After receiving the ﬁclose to finalﬂ TIGER
-X data, Clovis prepared drafts of a 
Prospectus Supplement for filing with the SEC and a
 roadshow presentation for use in soliciting 
potential investors in connection with the Offering. Both the Prospectus Supplement and the 
roadshow presentation referenced that Clovis had presented TIGER
-X data showing a 60%
 ORR 
at ASCO 2015, but without dis
closing that the data was unconfirmed. And in the case of the 
Prospectus Supplement, Clovis stated that TIGER
-X data, combined with data from the ongoing 
TIGER
-2 trial (which had patients on the 625mg dose), would ﬁform the basisﬂ of the 
forthcoming NDA su
bmission in late July 2015, without disclosing that Roci™s NDA ORR for 
the 500mg dose was lower than
 60%.
 23. On July 7, 2015, the day before the Offering, Clovis management, including 
Mahaffy and Mast, received the ﬁfinalﬂ data to be included in Roci™s initia
l NDA submission to 
the FDA. The data showed that Roci™s unconfirmed ORR was 42% for the 500mg dose. The 
data also showed that Roci™s confirmed ORR was only 31% for the 500mg dose, less than
 50% Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 15 8  of DRUG X™s confirmed ORR presented at ASCO. Later that same day, Mahaffy, Mast, and 
Clovis™ most senior clinical executives conducted an internal conference call to discuss the data.
 24. The defendants hoped, based on experience with prior Roci data sets, but d
id not 
know to any degree of certainty, that Roci™s ORR would increase by the time of a planned 90
- day efficacy update to the initial NDA submission. However, rather than disclose the current 
Roci ORR and Clovis™ hope that it would increase, Mahaffy and M
ast formally approved, in 
writing, the filing of the Prospectus Supplement with the SEC and the use of the roadshow 
presentation that both referenced the ASCO 2015 60% ORR. The Prospectus Supplement and 
the roadshow presentation omitted to disclose materia
l facts necessary to make the reference to 
the ASCO 2015 data not misleading, including Roci™s current unconfirmed and confirmed ORR. 
These documents gave investors the false impression that Roci™s ORR continued to be
 60%.
 25. The following day, on July 8, 201
5, Mahaffy led and Mast participated in multiple 
investor roadshow conference calls without disclosing Roci™s current unconfirmed or confirmed 
ORR.  During the conference calls Mahaffy described Roci and DRUG X as similarly 
efficacious.
 26. Clovis raised appro
ximately $298 million (net) in connection with the
 Offering.
  Not disclosing the current unconfirmed or confirmed ORR data inflated Clovis™ stock price and 
enabled Clovis to receive substantial ill
-gotten gains from the Offering.
 Roci™s ORR is Capped, But 
Clovis Continues to Reference the 60% Number from ASCO
  27. On or about July 28, 2015, Clovis™ lead statistician told Clovis™ lead clinician that 
the confirmed ORR in the NDA would improve only slightly by the time of the planned 90
-day 
efficacy update, if at all. The lead statistician also told the lead clinician,
 as well as Mahaffy, 
that the unconfirmed ORR might increase to 46% by the time of the planned 90
-day
 efficacy
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 15 9  update. Mahaffy therefore should have known that Roci™s unconfirmed ORR would not be more 
than 46% at the time of the 90
-day effica
cy update.
 28. On August 6, 2015, Clovis issued a press release announcing its second
-quarter 
2015 earnings. Mahaffy and Mast reviewed and approved the issuance of the press release and 
the accompanying earnings call script. The press release was also furnishe
d to the Commission 
on Form 8
-K and signed by
 Mast.
 29. The press release stated that Clovis had filed its initial NDA on July 30, 2015, and 
also summarized the data presented at the ASCO 2015 conference, again citing the 60% ORR 
figure (without disclosing it 
was unconfirmed) and again stating that the TIGER
-X and TIGER
-2 data formed the basis of Clovis™ NDA for Roci. During the accompanying investor conference 
call on August 6, 2015, Mahaffy told investors that Clovis had ﬁpresented a full update of our 
data s
et at ASCO,ﬂ giving the false impression that the ASCO 2015 data was consistent with the 
NDA data. Similarly, Mahaffy further stated on the August 6 investor call that, ﬁ[t]he primary 
dose we are seeking approval for is 500[mg], and that all comes from TIG
ER-X and the data you 
saw at ASCO.ﬂ In describing the data submitted in the NDA, Mahaffy further claimed that the 
ﬁdata sets have continued to demonstrate compelling and consistent
 activity.ﬂ
 30. In approximately September 2015, another biopharmaceutical compa
ny 
(ﬁCompany Yﬂ) conducted due diligence, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, as to Roci in 
connection with a potential acquisition of Clovis. When Company Y learned during the due 
diligence of the undisclosed ORR data concerning Roci 
Œ the same data 
that Clovis submitted to 
the FDA in its NDA 
Œ it withdrew from the potential acquisition of Clovis. The defendants knew 
or should have known that Company Y™s view was that Roci would not be competitive with 
DRUG
 X. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 15 10  31. The 90
-day efficacy update 
for Roci, submitted to the FDA on October 22, 2015, 
showed confirmed ORR of 33% and unconfirmed ORR of 46% for the 500mg dose. The 90
-day 
efficacy update data was shared and discussed with Mahaffy and Mast before it was submitted to 
the
 FDA.
 32. On November 5,
 2015, after submitting the 90
-day efficacy update, Clovis issued 
a press release announcing its third
-quarter 2015 earnings. Mahaffy and Mast reviewed and 
approved the issuance of the press release and the accompanying earnings call script. The press 
rele
ase was also furnished to the Commission on Form 8
-K and signed by
 Mast.
 33. In the press release and on the accompanying earnings conference call led by 
Mahaffy, Clovis highlighted medical presentations of Roci
 data that occurred during the third 
quarter and directed investors to review the presentations on Clovis™ website. These medical 
presentations again highlighted the ASCO 2015 data and the 60% ORR at the 500mg dose, 
without disclosing that the data was unc
onfirmed, or disclosing the lower ORR data submitted in 
the initial NDA submission, or disclosing the lower ORR data submitted to the FDA in 
connection with the 90
-day efficacy
 update.
 Clovis™ Disclosures Misled Investors
  34. Clovis™ references during the rel
evant time period to the ASCO presentation and 
its highlighting of the 60% ORR figure for the 500mg dose were misleading because the data 
submitted to the FDA showed response rates far below 60% for that dose, on either a confirmed 
or unconfirmed basis. In
vestors fairly understood that the ORR in the NDA submission, and the 
eventual Roci label, would be substantially similar to the 60% ASCO figure, when in fact the 
undisclosed data 
Œ which Clovis provided to the FDA 
Œ showed ORR ranging between 31% 
(confirm
ed) and 46%
 (unconfirmed).
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 15 11  35. Further, investors believed that the 60% ORR was ﬁconfirmed.ﬂ Presenting an 
ORR comprised of only confirmed responses was customary, and therefore investors would
 have 
expected Clovis to disclose if it was deviating
 from customary practice and its own clinical trial 
protocols by presenting unconfirmed ORR. Indeed, even a Clovis employee involved with 
medical publications believed that the ASCO 60% ORR represented a confirmed response
 rate.
 36. The continued use of the 60
% ORR figure, without disclosing that it was 
unconfirmed, and without disclosing that the data submitted to the FDA showed responses rates 
far below 60%, on either a confirmed or unconfirmed basis, led investors to the false
 conclusion 
that Roci
 and DRUG X had similar efficacy and therefore that Roci would be competitive in the 
marketplace. As late as November 6, 2015, analysts continued to cite Roci™s ﬁ60% response 
rateﬂ in concluding that Roci™s efficacy was ﬁvery similarﬂ to DRUG
 X. Clovis™ Su
bsequent Disclosure of Roci™s Confirmed ORR
  37. On Friday, November 6, 2015, the FDA sent a memorandum to Clovis in advance 
of a planned conference call on November 9, 2015, referred to as the ﬁMid
-Cycle 
Communication.ﬂ 
In 
the memorandum and conference call o
n November 9, 2015, the FDA 
informed Clovis that its seeking approval for Roci on the basis of unconfirmed data that deviated 
from RECIST was unacceptable, and that the accurately calculated confirmed ORR may not be 
of sufficient magnitude to predict clini
cal benefit. Mahaffy and Mast both received the FDA™s 
November 6, 2015 memorandum, and were informed following the November 9, 2015 
conference call that the FDA would not change its position that Clovis must use confirmed
 ORR.
 38. On November 10, 2015, Mast 
was scheduled to attend an investor conference
 that 
Mahaffy was originally scheduled to attend. Mahaffy and Mast spoke prior to the conference, 
and they decided together that Mast would still attend the conference. During the
 conference,
 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 15 12  Mast
 spoke from a deck of slides that was displayed overhead for investors to see and also 
posted to Clovis™ website. Even though Mahaffy and Mast knew or should have known that the 
FDA would require confirmed ORR, one of the slides included the ASCO 2015 60% 
ORR for 
the 500mg dose, but without disclosing that fact or the accurate ORR.
 39. On November 16, 2015, Clovis disclosed that Roci™s confirmed ORR for the 
NDA dataset was only 28%. When Clovis disclosed the true ORR, analysts reported that they 
were ﬁshockedﬂ 
and ﬁblindsided.ﬂ Analysts also concluded that Roci™s ORR was now 
ﬁmeaningfully lowerﬂ than DRUG X and, accordingly, ﬁreduced its competitiveness 
substantially.ﬂ As a result, on November 16, 2015, Clovis™ stock price closed down 
approximately 70%, or $69.1
9 per share (from a closing price of $99.43 per share on Friday, 
November 13, 2015 to a closing price of $30.24 per share on November 16). By May 2016,
 after 
receiving further feedback from the FDA, Clovis had ceased development of Roci and 
terminated enro
llment in all Clovis
-sponsored clinical studies of
 Roci.

 Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 15"
41,41,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against the former owner of a Texas-based investment education franchise for lying to dozens of investors in connection with a multimillion dollar offering fraud.

According to the SEC's complaint, Defendant Thomas J. Caufield convinced more than 40 investors to invest over $6 million in his high-yield promissory notes by promising investors significant returns generated from the revenues of what he claimed was a profitable franchise. Caufield allegedly used a combination of false pitches and offering materials to lure investors, who included both students of the franchise and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC-a former state-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield. According to the complaint, Caufield misled investors about the franchise's bleak financial condition, used new investor money to repay earlier investors, and falsely claimed that investors' notes were secured by assets.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas, charges Caufield with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Caufield consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating these provisions, and from engaging in certain future activities in connection with the purchase, offer and sale of securities. The final judgment orders disgorgement of $614,815.14 plus prejudgment interest of $126,032.11, both of which will be deemed satisfied by proceeds repaid to certain investors from Caufield's 2018 sale of the franchise. Caufield also agreed to a $160,000 civil penalty and will be barred from further association with certain regulated entities.

The SEC's investigation was led by Robert C. Hannan and Melvin Warren with litigation assistance from Christopher A. Davis, and supervised by Scott F. Mascianica and Eric Werner."," SEC v.

 SUMMARY
 1. From 
at least as early as 
2013 through 2017, 
Defendant 
Thomas J. 
Caufield 
convinced investors
Šincluding his advisory clients
Što invest 
more than 
$6 million in his high
-yield promissory note
s by misrepresenting key aspects of the offering. 
 Caufield represented that 
he would use investor funds to acquire and operate a fr
anchise that 
offer
ed investment education 
programs
.  Instead, he used 
a large portion of 
the funds for other 
purpose
sŠincluding paying 
returns to earlier investors
 and paying past
-due franchise expenses
.  He also
 misled investors 
about 
the franchise
™s 
financial condition
 and
 the safety of the investments. 
 The investor
 victims
 included 
both
 students
 of the franchise
 and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC (ﬁDAT 
Capitalﬂ)
Ša former state
-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield
. 2. Caufield conducted his offering

Caufield 
used a combination of verbal pitches and written offering materi
als to 
solicit
 investors, 
falsely 
portraying the investment as lucrative and safe.  
He did not disclose
 that
: (1) the franchise
 routinely failed to meet its current financial obligations
; (2) the notes 
were not 
secured by the franchise™s business
 assets,
 as claimed; and 
(3) investor funds 
would be used to
 pay his obligations on the prior, past
-due notes. 
 Additionally, Caufield 
did 
not 
register the 
offering 
with the SEC 
as required.
 3. By engaging in this conduct
, Caufield
 violated the antifraud
 and registration
 provisions of the federal securities laws.  He 
also violated the fiduciary dut

federal securities laws, the

 7. Venue is proper because 
the 
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business 
described
 below occurred within the jurisdiction of the Northern District of Texas.
 PARTIES
 8. Plaintiff 
SEC
 is an agency of the United States of America charged with 
enforcing the federal securities laws.
 9. Defendant 
Caufield
, age 
59, resides in Colleyville, Texas. 
 Caufield started in the 
securities industry in 1984 as a registered broker
-dealer representative and 
work
ed in the 
securities industry in various capacities until 2015.  Although not presently 
registered with the 
SEC or 
associated with a regulated entity, Ca
ufield was the sole associated person, operator
, and 
owner of DAT Capital
Ša state
-registered investment adviser from 2008 to 2015.
  During the 
offering, Caufield operated the franchise out of Irving, Texas
 and Frisco, Texas
. FACTS
 A. Caufield acted as an 
investment adviser
. 10. For more than 30 years, Caufield worked in the securities industry in various 
capacities.  
In 2008, he established DAT Capital
Šwhich 
was
 registered
 as an investment adviser 
in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin
, and Texas
.  Through DAT Capital, 
Caufield provided 
investment 
advisory services
Šincluding recommending
 investments in different securities. 
 He provided 
these services for a fee, which was based on the amount of client assets under management.  
Caufield managed 
as muc
h as
 $13 million in client assets as part of his advisory business.
 11. As an investment adviser, 
Caufield
 was a fiduciary to his clients.  Consequently, 
he had a fundamental obligation to act in his clients™ best interests and to provide investment 
advice tha
t was in their best interests.  He also owed his clients a duty of undivided loyalty and 
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 3 of 11   PageID 3 SEC v. 
Caufield
         Page 
4 Complaint
 utmost good faith.  
Finally, he was
 required to employ reasonable care to avoid misleading his 
clients and to provide them full and fair disclosure of all material fac
ts.
 B. Caufield offered unregistered securities.
 12. In 
2011, Caufield sought to expand his business activities and entered into 
discussions with 
a fr
anchisor about purchasing 
its Dallas
, Texas
 based franchise
.  The franchisor 
and its franchises were in the bu
siness of providing investment education classes.
  Caufield
 ultimately acquired the franchise 
later that year
.   13. After that
, from
 at least as early as
 2013 until 2017
, Caufield coordinated a series 
of 
integrated 
securities
 offerings to raise capital
Špurportedly
 to finance and operate the 
franchise
.  In these offerings, he offered high
-yield notes with
 annual
 interest rates ranging from 
10% to 1
8%.  The maturities on the notes ranged from 60 days to 
24 months.  These offerings, 
which were not limited 
to accredited investors,
1 were not registered with the SEC.
 14. These offerings were an integrated offering, since they shared a number of key 
characteristics: 
(1) Caufield controlled the operations of each of the 
note 
issuers and their bank 
accounts and facil
itated the transfer of funds between the issuers and 
the franchise
; (2) Caufield 
did not take any steps to verify whether the investors were accredited; 
(3) Caufield represented 
that 
franchise
 revenues would be used to repay investors; 
(4) Caufield represe
nted that 
investor
 funds would be used 
to pay
 the expenses of acquiring and operating 
the franchise
; (5) Caufield 
represented that each note would be secured by 
franchise 
assets; and 
(6) Caufield portrayed 
the 
franchise
 as a 
financially 
successful business
 venture
.                                                  1 An accredited investor is high
-net
-worth and/or sophisticated investor, as defined by the relevant statutes, rules, 
and regulations.
                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 4 of 11   PageID 4 SEC v. 
Caufield
         Page 
5 Complaint
 15. Between 2013 and 2017, Caufield raised approximately $6.
8 million through the 
integrated securities offering.
  He received investments from 
more than
 30 investors
Šincluding 
his advisory clients, to whom he recommended the investments.
 C. Caufield
 made material misrepresentations in connection with the securities offering
. 16. Caufield marketed the notes through both verbal presentations and written 
materials
.  When doing so, he misled investors regarding the financial condition of the franchise 
and th
e risks of the notes.
 17. As Caufield knew
 as its owner and operator
, the franchise was 
strained financially
 throughout the time of the offering.  It was not generating sufficient revenue to pay its current 
liabilities.  As a result, the franchise could only s
tay afloat by using proceeds from the offering
Šrather than business revenues
Što pay these liabilities.
 18. For example, Caufield knew that 
the franchise
 was 
regularly
 delinquent in its 
franchise payments to the 
franchisor. 
 This resulted in 
the
 franchise 
viola
ting
 the terms of the 
franchise agreement, 
which
 jeopardized 
Caufield
™s ownership
 of the franchise.
  Caufield cure
d these de
linquencies
 by using
 incoming investor funds 
from the offering 
to pay the past
-due 
obligations
.  On at least six occasions, Caufield used a total of $368,362.31 in investor funds to 
pay 
the franchise™s
 obligations to the 
franchisor.
 19. Despite the franchise™s 
strained
 financial condition, Caufield touted its 
supposed 
financial success when offering the notes to prospective investors.  In both written offering 
materials distributed to investors and verbal pitches, 
Caufield 
claimed that the franchise was 
a profitable and 
financially su
ccessful
 enterprise
Ševen though it w
as not.
 20. Caufield 
also 
sometimes 
included unaudited financial information for 
the
 franchise
 in his written offering materials
Šincluding a profit
-and
-loss statement and facts on 
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 5 of 11   PageID 5 SEC v.

 student enrollment and tuition.
  This financial information 
was misleading becau
se it 
portrayed 
the franchise to be financially successful.
  It did not
 disclose
 important information regarding the 
franchise™s liabilities
, including
 details about the millions of dollars in notes payable from the 
offering
. 21. Caufield 
also 
represented
Šboth
 verbally and in writing
Šthat the notes were 
secured by 
the franchise
™s assets.  
In reality,
 however,
 Caufield never caused 
the franchise
, or 
any of the 
entities
 he controlled
, to file a financing statement in favor of the investors.  
Nor did 
he ever cause
 the franchise
 to segregate proceeds for the purpose of repaying the notes.  
Therefore
, in reality
, the notes were completely unsecured.
 D. Caufield misapp
lied
 investor funds in order to keep the franchise afloat and to pay 
promised returns on the notes
. 22. Due to the franchise™s 
strained
 financial condition, Caufield deceptively 
misapplied investor funds to keep it afloat.  
He 
also failed to
 disclose th
is deceptive conduct
 to 
investors.
   23. Caufield represented that: 
(1) he would use investor funds to finance 
franchise
 operations
 (typically advertising campaigns or expansion and relocation expenses
); and 
(2) he 
would use 
franchise
 operating revenues
 (not funds from other investors)
 to repay investors.  
However, as the controller of the bank accounts, he 
did not
 actually 
do this
.  In reality
Šsince the 
franchise was failing financially, as detailed above
ŠCaufield resorted to misapp
lying investor 
funds both to pay 
unauthorized 
business expenses and to pay the promised investment returns.
                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 6 of 11   PageID 6 SEC v.

 E. Funds were re
paid to 
investors through
 payments from later investors and

franchise
. 24. From 2013
 to 20
17, Caufield raised
 $6,762,031.37 from investors
 while returning 
$6,147,216.23 to them
.  This left 
a shortfall to 
investors 
of $614,815.14. 25. After the SEC™s invest
igation began, 
the franchisor placed 
Caufield and the Dallas 
franchise on heightened supervision.  
Then, i
n 2018, the Dallas franchise was sold to an 
independent third party.  The sale of the franchise
, pursuant to terms set by the franchisor,
 resulted in 
an additional
 distribution of
 $1,329,976.97 to 
the franchise™s student investors

42,42,"The SEC filed insider trading charges on September 10, 2018 against a corporate deal advisor for trading in securities of two China-based companies based on confidential information about their impending acquisitions. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Rong Chen obtained this inside information in the course of his work advising the acquiring companies on these transactions and used an account bearing his wife's name in order to conceal the illicit trades. The SEC also charged Chen's wife, Yuehong Wang, as a relief defendant.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Chen was Vice President of Investments for Tsinghua Unigroup Limited during its 2014 acquisition of RDA Microelectronics Inc. and learned of the deal before it was announced. The SEC's complaint alleges that shortly before the November 11, 2013 announcement, Chen opened a brokerage account in his wife's name and used that account to make a series of well-timed purchases of RDA securities ahead of the announcement to generate more than $79,500 in trading profits. The SEC further alleges that when Chen later became Managing Director at a Hong Kong-based investment banking firm advising 58.com Inc. on its April 2015 acquisition of rival ganji.com, he again used his wife's brokerage account to commit insider trading, buying high risk 58.com call options, which he sold after news of the acquisition for profits of more than $94,400.

The SEC's complaint charges Chen with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, jointly and severally from Chen and Wang plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty from Chen.

The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Marcus Fruchter and Amy Flaherty Hartman of the SEC's Cyber Unit in the Chicago Regional Office and David Makol and John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The case has been supervised by Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Kathryn Pyszka, an Associate Regional Director in the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Benjamin Hanauer and Marcus Fruchter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Association.","  COMPLAINT 1   12

 Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges as 
follows: JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
1. The Commission brings this action 
pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78u-1].   2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 3. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(3) and 
Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 4. On information and belief, Defendant Rong Chen is an inhabitant, transacts business, and may be found in the 
Central District of California.  Relief Defendant Yuehong Wang is Chen™s wife and is an inhabitant of and may be found in the Central District of California.  Wang 
resides, and, on information and belief, Chen at least periodically resides, at their hom
e in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.      
5. Chen has directly or indirectly made use of the means or 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein. 
6. Chen will, unless enjoined, continue to engage in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint, or in acts, practices, 
transactions, and courses of business of similar purport and object. 
SUMMARY 7. Over a two year period, Defendant Rong Chen engaged in multiple acts of insider trading by making timely and highly profitable securities purchases based on material nonpublic information about the impending acquisitions of two China-

based companies whose securities traded on 
exchanges in the United States.  Chen obtained this inside information in the course of his work advising the acquiring

28companies on these transactions.  Attempti
ng to conceal his insider trading, Chen 
placed his trades using the brokerage account of his wi
fe, Yuehong Wang.  Chen™s 
insider trading generated more
 than $173,000 in illicit profits, the majority of which 
Chen transferred to his and Wang™s joint bank account.  Because Wang shared the benefits of Chen™s illegal conduct, she is named as a Relief Defendant in this action.  8. Chen™s first set of insider trades occurred while he was the Vice 
President of Investments for the Chin
ese company Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. 
(ﬁTsinghuaﬂ).  On November 11, 2013, Ts
inghua publicly announced that it would acquire another Chinese comp
any, RDA Microelectronics, Inc. (ﬁRDAﬂ).  Prior to that announcement, Chen used his wife™s U.S. brokerage account to make a series of 
well-timed purchases of RDA securities, 
generating profits of more than $79,500 
following the acquisition announcement.  Chen personally worked on the RDA acquisition, and made those trades based on material, nonpublic information not available to the investing public.   9. In early 2015, Chen again engaged in insider trading, this time 
purchasing securities of the Chinese compa
ny 58.com Inc. (ﬁ58.co
mﬂ).  By January 2015, Chen was working as an investment 
consultant to 58.com on the acquisition of a large stake in a rival company.  Shortly
 before the acquisition was announced to the public, Chen used his wife™s brokerage account to buy ﬁout of the moneyﬂ 58.com 
call options on a U.S. exchange.  When news of the acquisition became public, 58.com™s stock price skyrockete
d, and Chen sold his options, earning profits of more 
than $94,400.  Again, by virtue of his work on the deal, when he purchased the 58.com options Chen had knowledge of material, nonpublic information that was not 
available to other investors.   10. Chen™s insider trading violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5).  The Commission brings this action to hold Ch
en accountable for his illegal conduct, permanently enjoin Chen from further insi
der trading, and impose civil penalties.  Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 3 of 14   Page ID #:3  COMPLAINT 4   12

COMMONLY-USED 
TRADING TERMS 11. A stock option, commonly referred to as an ﬁoption,ﬂ gives its 
purchaser-holder the option to buy or sell shares of an underlying stock at a specified 
price (the ﬁstrike priceﬂ) before a specified time (the ﬁexpirationﬂ).  Options are 
generally sold in ﬁcontracts,ﬂ which give the option holder the opportunity to buy or 
sell 100 shares of an underlying stock.  If 
the holder does not exercise the option prior 
to the expiration date, the option expires as worthless. 12. A ﬁcallﬂ option, such as those purch
ased by Chen, gives the purchaser-holder of the option the right, but not the 
obligation, to purchase a security at a specified strike price prior to expiration.
  For example, one ﬁDecember 2013 $15ﬂ 
call on ABC Co.™s shares would give the purchaser the right to buy 100 ABC shares 
for $15 per share before the call expired on a specified date in December 2013.  
Generally, the buyer of a call option anticip
ates that the price of the underlying security will increase prior to expiration.  If the call option™s strike price is above the price at which the underlying stock is trading, the call option is considered to be ﬁout 
of the money,ﬂ because it woul
d be unprofitable to exercise the call and pay more for 
the stock than the price for which it could be obtained in the market.  Conversely, if 
the strike price is below the then-current market price, the call is 
considered to be ﬁin the money,ﬂ because one could exercise th
e option, obtain the stock at the strike price, and then sell it at the higher market
 price for a profit.  For a given expiration month, out of the money options are typica
lly cheaper to buy than those that are in the money.

28FACTS 
The Defendant and Relief Defendant 13. Defendant Rong Chen, 50 years old, is a United States citizen.  On 
information and belief, Ch
en resides both in China and Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  During the period at issue in this lawsuit, Chen worked as a Vice 
President for Investments at Tsinghua, and la
ter worked as a managing director at a 
Hong Kong investment banking firm. 
14. Relief Defendant Yuehong Wang is a United States citizen who resides in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  Wang is Chen™s wife.  Wang and Chen share a 
joint bank account that received the proceeds of Chen™s insider trading. 
Relevant Entities 15. Tsinghua is a Chinese company engage
d in electronics, biotechnology, 
science park development, and urban infrastructure development.   16. RDA was a China-based semiconduc
tor company that produced 
component parts used in mobile phones.
  RDA™s American Depository Shares (ﬁADSﬂ) traded on NASDAQ (ticker: RDA) until RDA was acquired by Tsinghua in July 2014.  Prior to the acquisition, RDA 
options traded on U.S. securities exchanges 
including NASDAQ and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (ﬁCBOEﬂ).  17. 58.com is a China-based company that op
erates one of China™s largest online marketplaces, transferring products and services between purchasers and sellers.  58.com™s shares are listed on th
e New York Stock Exchange (ticker: WUBA), and its options are traded on U.S. securities exchanges including CBOE and 
the New York Stock Exchange. 18. ganji.com was a privately held China-based online classified 
advertisement company which was a 
business competitor of 58.com.  
Chen™s RDA Insider Trading 19. In September 2013, RDA had discussions with its investment banking advisors about potential acquisition opportunities.   Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 5 of 14   Page ID #:5  COMPLAINT 6   12

2820. On September 27, 2013, RDA publicly 
announced that it had received a non-binding acquisition proposal from a po
tential buyer at $15.50 per ADS.   21. By October 2013, Chen was employed by Tsinghua as its Vice President for Investments.  In that position, Ch
en had access to and possessed material, nonpublic information about Tsinghua™s acqui
sition of RDA described herein.  Chen also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, 
that he was required to keep information 
about the acquisition confidential.   22. On October 21, 2013, personnel from 
RDA and Tsinghua met to discuss a potential acquisition and, three days later, the companies executed a non-disclosure 
and confidentiality agreement.   23. On October 24, 2013, the potential buyer that submitted the acquisition 
proposal previously announced on Septem
ber 27 informed RDA that it would not 
consider increasing its acquisition offer.   24. The next day, October 25, Tsinghua made an acquisition proposal to 
RDA for $18.00 per ADS Œ a $2.50 per ADS increase over the proposal announced on September 27.  Tsinghua™s offer included a confidentiality requirement that 
precluded RDA from immediately disclosing it.  25. On October 28, 2013, RDA sent a draft 
merger agreement to Tsinghua.   26. That same day, Chen opened, in Wang™s name, a brokerage account at a 
United States brokerage firm 
(the ﬁWang accountﬂ).  Chen left blank the portion of 
the online account application that requested information about Wang™s marital 
status, and he listed Wang as the only person with trading authority over the account.  
When he opened the Wang account, Chen re
quested the ability to place trades in the account on margin. 
27. Despite listing Wang as the sole person with trading authority over the 
Wang account, Chen had access to and directed all of the trading in that account.  28. Upon opening the Wang account, Chen funded the account with an 
initial deposit of $17,000. Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 6 of 14   Page ID #:6  COMPLAINT 7   12

accountﬂ).  Chen had no prior history trading RDA securities in this account.  Chen 
sold those holdings for more than $19,000, 
and transferred the account balance to his and Wang™s joint bank account (the ﬁjoint bank accountﬂ). 
31. On November 1, 2013, Chen purchased 270 RDA December 2013 $15 
call options in the Wang account for $16,409.  That same day, Chen deposited an 
additional $18,000 into the Wang account from their joint bank account.   
32. On November 6, 2013, Chen pur
chased, on margin, eight RDA December 2013 $15 call options and 2,300 RDA 
ADSs at $15.59 per share, for a total of $36,512.   33. Later that day, after the close of trading, RDA publicly announced its receipt of Tsinghua™s previously undisclosed October 25, 2013 offer to acquire RDA 
for $18 per ADS.  34. The market reacted favorably to 
the announcement.  The next day, 
November 7, 2013, the pri
ce of RDA ADSs climbed a
nd closed at $17.24, up from RDA™s pre-announcement close of $15.55, a 10.9% increase.

purchased in the Wang account for approximately $39,700, realizing one day profits of $3,852.  Later that day, Chen purchased an additional 86 RDA December 2013 
$15 call options for $19,832. 36. On November 11, 2013 at 3:33 a.m.
 ET, RDA and Tsinghua issued a joint press release announcing the compan
ies™ entry into a definitive merger 
agreement under which Tsinghua would acquire RDA at a price of $18.50 per ADS Œ an increase of $.50 per ADS over Tsinghua™s previously disclosed offer.  The press release identified Chen as Tsinghua™s ﬁVice President Œ I

a director of a special purpose entity that was created to effectuate the merger and signed the amended merger agreement on behalf of that entity.  Other Commission filings also disclosed that Chen was an official designated by the parties to receive notices regarding the merger agreement. 38. On November 11, 2013, following the 
press release, Chen sold all 364 RDA December 2013 call options that he had 
purchased in November 2013, for more 
than $112,500, realizing a profit of roughly $75,670 on his RDA options trades.  

Chen™s illegal trading in RDA securities netted more 
than $79,520 in profits.  39.  On January 6, 2014, Chen transferred $60,000 from 
the Wang account to their joint bank account.   
Chen™s 58.com Insider Trading 
40. By January 2015, 58.com 
was considering acquiring a large stake in a privately-held rival company,
 ganji.com (ﬁganjiﬂ), and ha
d retained Chen to assist with the potential acquisition. 
41. On January 23, 2015, 58.com and Ch
en entered into a ﬁfinder™sﬂ agreement regarding the potential ganji 
acquisition.  In the agreement, 58.com 
acknowledged that Chen originated and introduced the potential ganji acquisition to 
58.com. 42. The finder™s agreement provided that 58.com would pay Chen $5 million 
in the event 58.com or its affiliates obtained a majority equity interest in ganji.  Should 58.com obtain less than a majority stak

Chen would receive a payment from 58.com in
 an amount to be mutually determined 
by 58.com and Chen. 43. The finder™s agreement additionally contained a confidentiality clause

2844. In early 2015, Chen became a Managing Director at a Hong Kong-based investment banking firm. 
45. On March 11, 2015, 58.com engaged Ch
en™s investment banking firm to 
advise on its potential acquisition of ganji.
  Chen worked on, and was privy to material nonpublic information about, the 
proposed ganji acquisition.  Chen also 
knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he was required to keep information about the acquisition confidential.   46. As consultants to 58.com, Chen a
nd his investment banking firm were subject to 58.com™s insider trading policies,
 which expressly prohibited trading based on material nonpublic inform
ation related to 58.com. 47. Between March 12 and April 12, 2015, 58.com and the investment 
banking firm where Chen worked excha
nged term sheets with various ganji 
stakeholders and executives and the parties convened several conference calls and meetings in Beijing to discuss a potential acquisition of ganji.  In a series of meetings 
that took place from late in the day of April 13, 2015 to the morning of April 14, 
2015 (Beijing time), management from 58.com 
and ganji agreed to a framework for the transaction and to a memorandum 
of understanding (ﬁMOUﬂ) regarding the 
acquisition, which was executed on April 14, 2015.   48. The same day 58.com entered the MOU, April 14, 2015, starting at 9:59 
a.m. ET (9:59 p.m. Beijing time) through 10:
06 a.m. ET (10:06 p.m. Beijing time), 
Chen used the Wang account to purchase, at a cost of $5,507.68, 100 58.com call 
options with a strike price of $55 and an expiration date only three days away.  These call options were significantly out of the 
money.  The day before Chen™s option 
purchases, 58.com™s shares 
had closed at $50.83.   49. Chen made these options purchases using nearly the entire cash balance in the Wang account.  Chen had no prior history trading 58.com securities in the joint brokerage account or the Wang account. 50. Less than 30 minutes after Chen ma
de the 58.com options purchases, Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 9 of 14   Page ID #:9  COMPLAINT 10   12

54. Following the announcement of the merger, Chen received a cash 
payment from 58.com pursuant to the finder™s

45,45,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged the U.S.-based former CFO of a public company based in China with improperly commingling corporate and personal funds as part of a practice to transfer funds to the U.S. while avoiding foreign currency controls.

According to the SEC's complaint, over a 20-month period, Adam C. Wasserman used a personal account to transfer over $400,000 in corporate funds from China to the U.S. to pay the Chinese company's U.S. expenses. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Wasserman had previously engaged in the same practice with at least two other China-based public companies. The SEC's complaint alleges that by repeatedly commingling corporate funds with his own personal funds Wasserman put the company's assets at risk for misuse and loss and, through his conduct, Wasserman knowingly failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Wasserman agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gregory C. Padgett and Cecilia B. Connor and supervised by Amy L. Friedman, with assistance from Leigh Barrett, Jan M. Folena, James E. Smith, and Janet S. Yang."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

DEFENDANT 
7. Adam Wasserman, age 54, lives in Weston, Fl
orida.  He served as Issuer A™s outsourced CFO from November 2007 to Fe
bruary 2008, from March 2008 to December 2008, and from December 2012 to February 2016.  At
 all other times since November 2007, 
Wasserman provided outsourced ac
counting services to Issuer A through his business, CFO Oncall.    Wasserman was issued a license from
 the New York State Education Department to 
practice Certified Public Accountancy in November 1988; his license has been inactive since June 1997. Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 2 of 9 3 RELATED ENTITIES 
8. Issuer A is a company incorporated in Ne
vada with its principal place of business in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China.  Issu
er A was formed in 2007 through a merger of a 
public shell and a group of industrial manufacturing companies 
based in Wuxi, China, under common ownership and control.  During the relevant time period, Issuer A had a market 
capitalization of less than $15 million and was in 
the business of manufacturing textile machines 
and industrial components.  Issuer A™s securiti
es trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market and are registered with the Commission pursuant to
 Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. 9. CFO Oncall is a company incorporated in Florida with its principal place of 
business in Broward County, Florida.  Wasserman is the principa
l and majority owner of CFO 
Oncall. 
FACTS 
10. As a public company, Issuer A  was required to devise and maintain a system of 
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that, among other things, 
transactions were recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting prin
ciples and to maintain accountability for 
assets. 
11. As a public company, Issuer A was also required to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflected the transactions 
and dispositions of the company™s assets. 
12. As CFO of Issuer A, Wasserman was re
sponsible for devising and maintaining 
Issuer A™s system of internal accounting controls
 and for ensuring the accuracy of Issuer A™s 
books and records.  Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 3 of 9 4 A. China Currency Restrictions 
13. Upon information and belief, currency 
restrictions imposed by the Chinese 
government limit the ability of co
mpanies to transfer cash direc
tly from China to a corporate 
account in the U.S.   B. Management of Issuer A™s U.S. Cash and Expenses 14. For each fiscal year from its format
ion in 2007 until at least 2016, Issuer A generated most of its revenue in China. 15. During this period, Issuer A incurred a variety of U.S. expenses including audit, legal, and filing fees.  16. Prior to December 2014, Issuer A genera
ted cash within the U.S. to pay its  expenses in at least two different ways.   17. From approximately 2012 to 2013, Issuer A ma
de sales of at least $1.7 million to a U.S.-based customer who paid through wire 
transfers to Issuer A™s U.S. corporate bank account. 18. Issuer A also raised cash from time to time 
by issuing securities to U.S. investors.  These investors wired funds to a U.S. escrow account and in turn to Issuer A™s U.S. corporate bank account. C. Wire Transfers from China to the U.S. 
19. By late 2014, Issuer A lacked sufficient U.S. cash to pay expenses. 20. To address this problem, Wasserman devel
oped the following practice:  Issuer A personnel wired Issuer A funds into Wasserm
an™s personal bank account, a joint checking 
account with his wife.  After subtracting wire fees, Wasserman transferred 
these funds to Issuer A™s U.S. account under his control. Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 4 of 9 5 21. From December 2014 to July 2016, in a series of nine transactions, Wasserman 
transferred a total of $423,989.00 in Issuer A™s corporate funds from China to the U.S. via his personal account:   Wires of Issuer A Funds from China to

46,46,"On September 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Nevada Sports Investment Group, LP (Nevada Sports) with violating the federal securities laws. Nevada Sports was one of a number of organizations formed pursuant to a 2015 Nevada state law that, for the first time, allowed Nevada-based entities to collect and pool money from investors anywhere in the world for purposes of sports wagering. Entities like Nevada Sports promoted their investment opportunities as functioning like mutual funds.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of Nevada, in 2015 Nevada passed a law allowing entities to solicit and collect funds from individual investors anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, place wagers on certain sporting events, and split the wagering profits among the investors. From 2015 through 2017, Nevada Sports raised over $1 million from more than 30 investors. Nevada Sports conducted a general solicitation by widely offering its investment opportunity on the internet and further failed to make a determination regarding whether all of its investors were accredited.

The Complaint charges Nevada Sports with conducting an unregistered offering of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission accepted Nevada Sport's offer of settlement in which, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, it consented to the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requiring it to send a copy of the final judgment to each investor.

 1 2. In 2015
, the 
Nevada 
legislature 
enacted Senate Bill 443 (ﬁNVSB 
2 443ﬂ)
, allowing entities that fulfilled req
uirements specified in the bill to collect 
3 funds from individuals anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, wager 
4 those funds on sporting events, and share the wagering profits with the 
5 individu
als who contributed the funds.
 6 3. Such entities, 
sometimes 
known as ﬁsports betting funds
,ﬂ were 
7 described 
by some
 (including Contrarian)
 as 
functioning like mutual funds.
 8 4. Pu
rsuant to NVSB 443, each sports betting fund must
 keep
 a N
evada 
9 bank account in which it
 aggregates
 the funds 
raised from individuals, 
which 
are 
10 then
 used 
to wager on sporting events.
 11 5. Contrarian
 retained a 
percentage 
of any
 profit generated
 as a fee
.  12 After that fee was subtracted, 
Contrarian
 divided the 
remaining 
profit 
pro rata
 13 among all the individuals that contributed funds
 (ﬁClientsﬂ)
.  Thus, as profits 
14 increase
d or decrease
d, the fortunes 
of the 
Clients
 and Contrarian
 rose or
 fell 15 together
. 16 6. Contrarian
 had an individual who
, working
 alone
, decided how the 
17 funds would be wagered on sporting events.

 sports betting fund
, and

2 fulfill the requirements 
necessary 
to qualify for

 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 9 of 9"
48,48,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against a microcap company and its CEO for issuing false and misleading press releases as part of a market manipulation scheme.

According to the SEC's complaint, In Ovations Holdings, Inc. (ticker: INOH) and its CEO, Mark Goldberg, issued false and misleading press releases as part of a scheme to fraudulently induce investors to buy Ovations stock so that one or more stock promoters could sell their Ovations shares. For example, as alleged in the complaint, on June 10, 2014, Ovations claimed that it ""obtained exclusive rights to market"" a ""sophisticated sputum cytology technology for early and pre stage detection of lung cancer from . . . an officer and director of INOH."" In fact, according to the complaint Goldberg knew this release was false and misleading because Ovations never provided any funding to the individual under its licensing agreement and that individual never served as an officer or director of Ovations.

The United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced criminal charges against Goldberg, who was a registered representative associated with ten broker-dealers between 1992 and 2003.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, charges Ovations and Goldberg with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering permanent injunctive relief and civil monetary penalties against Ovations and Goldberg, and also disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, an officer and director bar, and a penny stock bar against Goldberg.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the FBI."," MARC P. BERGER

of selling 
environmental controls and 
biochar products to the cannabis industry
. Since then, Ovations has claimed
 to sell water filtra
tion 
and purification 
systems.
 Ovations™ common stock, not

seven false or misleading press 
releases about its business. 
 12.On information and belief, Goldberg
, as Ovations™ CEO, 
generated each of these 
press releases himself and
 caused Ovations to issue them
.  13.Goldberg did so 
to 
fraudulently induce investors to buy shares of Ovations stock 
so 
that 
one or more stock promoters could sell their Ovations shares 
in the market 
for 
a profit
.  14.Goldberg knew or recklessly disregarded the falsity or misleading nature of each of 
these press releases. 
 15.On information and belief, 
Goldberg received approximately $250,000 in return 
from one or more stock promoters at least partly for Goldberg™s role in 
issuing 
Ovations™ 
false or 
misleading press releases. 
 A.The Press Releases

Ovations 
issue
d a press release
 entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, 
Inc. Announces the Licensing of Technology for Early Detection of Lung Cancer.ﬂ
 17.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this 
press release.
 18.The press release claimed
:  
[Ovations] 
has concluded negotiations for licensing sophisticated 
sputum cytology technology for early and pre stage detection of lung 
cancer from Mel Ehrlich, Ph.D., who is also an officer and director 
of INOH. Dr. Ehrlich has invented, patented, perfected and 
marketed multi
ple biomedical and energy efficiency technologies. 
Pursuant to the license, INOH obtained exclusive rights to market 

the sputum cytology and related technologies world-
wide from Dr. 
Ehrlich. 
Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4 5 
 19.On July 2, 2014, at approximately 9:25 a.m.,
1 Ovations 
issued a 
press release
 entitled 
ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Announces the Immediate Ava
ilability of the Early Detection
 of Lung 
Cancer Kit.ﬂ 
20.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this 
press release. 
 21.The press 
release claimed
: 
[Ovations] is pleased to announce the implementation of the 
technology using sputum cytology for the early detection of lung 
cancer, a recognized laboratory procedure similar to the ‚Pap™ test. 
Mel Ehrlich, Ph.D. stated, ‚I am pleased with the diligent effo
rts that 
[Ovations] is implementing with the sputum cytology technology for 

the early detection of lung cancer.™ 
 22.In reality, 
Dr. 
Ehrlich never served as an officer or director of Ovations
, as Goldberg 
knew from his position as Ovations™ CEO. 
 23.Nor did Ovations ever provide any funding to Dr. Ehrlich under its licensing 
agreement
 in order to obtain rights to his technology
, as Goldberg similarly knew. 
 24.On June 30 and 
July 1, 
2014, the two days before Ovations issued its July 2 press 
release, 
and on 
July 
2, 2014, no shares of Ovations
™ common stock 
traded in the market.  
 25.On July 3, 2014, 
the day after Ovations issued 
the 
press release, approximately 
9.95 million 
Ovations 
shares traded in the market. 
 B.The Press Releases about 
Acquiring a Wholly
-Owned Subsi
diary
 26.Less than seven months later, on January 20, 2015, at approximately 8:50 a.m., 
Ovations 
issued 
a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Acquires NBE Financial 
Network, Inc. With Close to 1 Million Dollars in Annual Revenues Through 
Management of Several 

Locations in Four States.ﬂ 
                                                           1  All times alleged in this Complaint reflect 
Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Time. 
 Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 5 6 
 27.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this 
press release.
 28.The press release claimed: 
 [Ovations] has acquired NBE Financial Network, Inc. (NBE) as a 
wholly owned subsidi
ary. With nearly $1 million d
ollars in revenues 
in 2014, NBE™
s acquisition by INOH continues the trend of the 

company™s diversification and augments its current holdings with a 
strong revenue generating network. NBE, managing established 
offices in Florida
, New York, New Jersey and Illinois, is engaged in 
the operation and management of law offices in these multiple states 

and is also engaged in the acquisition and management of residential 
properties. 
29.The press release also quoted Goldberg:  
Mark Goldberg,
 INOH Co
-CEO added, ‚–In seeking out this 
relationship and ultimately acquiring NBE as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary, we consistently kept in mind the feedback from our 
valued shareholders. By acquiring NBE, a company with nearly $1 
million dollars in revenues
 and a presence in multiple metropolitan 
areas, we have augmented INOH™s holdings in order to balance 

active, present value with our other holdings of strong future 
potential.™ 
30.In reality, Ovations never acquired NBE Financial Network, Inc. (ﬁNBEﬂ)
 and NBE 
never became Ovations™ subsidiary, as Goldberg knew from his position as Ovations™ CEO. 
31.On January 16, 2015, the last trading day before Ovations issued its January 20 press 
release, approximately 74 million shares of Ovations™ common stock traded in the 
market. 
 32.On January 20, 2015, the day Ovations issued th
at press release, almost four times as 
many
Šover 275 million
ŠOvations shares traded in the market. 
 33.On March 16, 2015, at approximately 9:40 a.m., Ovations issued a press release 
entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc.™s Wholly-
Owned Subsidiary NBE Financial Network, Inc. 
Reports Substantial Increases in Revenue.ﬂ

Ovations 
issued 
a press release 
entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Announces Expansion Into Multimedia Production, Network

 40.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this

Multimedia (ASAP). Since 1987, ASAP has been a leading full service television, web, multimedia 

and production company and creative agency.
ﬂ  42.From his position as Ovations™ CEO and his discussions with ASAP™s president
, Goldberg knew that Ovations had never acquired an ownership interest in ASAP. Indeed, Goldberg 

knew that, in approximately March 2015, 
Ovations had entered into an agreement with ASAP by 

which Ovations would obtain an interest in ASAP 
in the future
 upon Ovations™ ful
fillment of certain
 conditions and that Ovations had not in fact fulfilled those conditions.

D.The Press Releases About the Tank Farm 
 47.On June 10, 2015, at approximately 9:23 a.m., 
Ovations 
issued 
a press release entitled 
ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. (INOH) Enters Into Letter of Intent on Acquisition of 7.5 Million 
Gallon Tank Farm Calculated to Value Over $13,000,000 and to Yield Revenues of $1.8 Million 

Dollars per Year.ﬂ
 48.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issu
e this 
press release.
 49.The press release c
laimed:
 [Ovations] and 
2 Lisa Court Corporation executed a Letter of Intent 
(LOI) for the purchase and rehabilitation of the Meridian Mid 
Continent Tank 
Farm and Terminal (hereinafter ‚Tank Farm™) located 
in 
Meridian, Mississippi. The Tank Farm
–, after rehabilitation, will 
produce an approximate income in excess of $1,800,000 per year and 

possess a total property/project value of between $13,000,000 and 
$14,000,000.
   
50.The press release also 
announced Goldberg™
s resignation as co
-CEO. 
 51.On June 25, 2015, at approximately 8:54 a.m., 
Ovations issued a press release entitled 
ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. (INOH) Executes Purchase and Sale Contract on Acquisition of 7.5 
Million Gallon Tank Farm Calculated to Value Over 
$13,000,000 and to Yield Revenues of $1.8

   Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8 9 
 52.This press release similarly claimed:
 [Ovations] 
and 2 Lisa Court Corporation executed a formal Purchase 
and Sale Agreement for the purchase and rehabilitation of the 
Meridian Mid Continent Tan
k Farm and Terminal (hereinafter ‚Tank 
Farm™
) located in Meridian, Mississippi.
 The Tank Farm
–, after 
rehabilitation, will produce an approximate income in excess of 

$1,800,000 per year and possesses a total property/project value of 
between $13,000,000 an
d $14,000,000.
 As previously disclosed, 2 Lisa 
Court Corporation has already committed to provide up to 50% 

seller financing to [Ovations] 
on the approximately 20 acre 
site.
 Additional financing is expected to come from private offerings 
and a traditional bank-
financed real estate loan.
  
53.The press release further claimed: ﬁ[W]e are pleased to announce that [Ovations] has 
welcomed Mr. Ted Doukas 
[the owner of 2 Lisa Court Corporation] 
to its Board of Directors.
 Mr. 
Doukas is a recognized corporate turn-around specialist and [Ovations] looks forward to receiving 
his input and expert advice.ﬂ 
54.In fact, a
lthough Goldberg had spoken with Ted Doukas about Ovations™ potential 
purchase of a Mississippi tank farm (for oil storage) owned by 2 Lisa Court, Goldberg 
never
 asked 
Doukas to serve on Ovations™ Board of Directors, and Doukas never agreed to do so.  
55.Goldberg thus 
knew that 
Doukas had never agreed to join and indeed never joined 
Ovations™ Board of Directors.  
56.Furthermore, o
n information and belief, Ovations had no reasonable basis for the 
tank farm 
income and valuation projections contained in the June 10 and June 25 press 
release
s. 
57.On June 9, 2015, the day before Ovations issued the June 10 press release, 
approximately 37 million shares of Ovations traded.  
58.On June 10, 2015, the day Ovations issued that press release, almost eight times as 
many Ovations shares

Ovations™ 
June 25 press release, he complained to 
Goldberg 
that the press release was false. Goldberg cla
imed that it was a mistake
 and did not say 
anything to Doukas to give him the impression that Goldberg was no longer involved with 
Ovations
.  62.On October 27, 2015, Ovations issued an ﬁAnnual Report Œ

50,50,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the former president of a Tennessee-based energy company with concealing from investors that two convicted criminals ran the company and led a $15 million oil investment scheme affecting more than 150 investors.

The SEC's complaint alleges that the former president of Southern Energy Group, Inc., Robert William Dorrance, misled investors by failing to disclose that the two individuals actually were running the company instead of Dorrance. Last year, the SEC charged the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling investors that the funds would be used to acquire interests in wells and to recover oil from wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for their personal use. With no background in the oil industry, Dorrance's main work experience was as a former stereo salesman. He largely performed clerical and administrative work at the direction of the two convicted criminals.

Dorrance agreed to be permanently prohibited from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay $101,075 in disgorgement plus interest, and $42,500 in civil penalties, for a total of $143,575.

The SEC's continuing investigation is being handled by Brian M. Basinger, Stephen E. Donahue, and Edward G. Sullivan, all from the agency's Atlanta office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the U.S. Secret Service.

  ROBERT WILLIAM DORRANCE,
    Defendant
.     AMENDED
 COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
   The plaintiff, 
the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this 
Complaint and alleges the following:
 SUMMARY
 1. Between at least January 201
5 and February 2016, 
Defendant Robert William 
Dorrance 
(ﬁDorranceﬂ) 
aided and abetted 
a scheme by 
David R. Greenlee (ﬁGreenleeﬂ) 
and 
David 
A. Stewart, Jr. (ﬁStewartﬂ)
 that resulted in the 
fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million
 of securities 
to more than 150 investors.  
 2. During this time
, Greenlee, Stewart, their principal salesman, 
Richard P. 
Underwood (ﬁUnderwoodﬂ)
, and other 
salesmen whom 
Greenlee and Stewart 
recruited and 
controlled, 
fraudulently sold
 int
erests in various
 limited 
partnersh
ips and
 joint ventures t
hat were 
purportedly created t
o extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
 3.   In soliciting investors, Greenlee, 
Stewart
 and Underwood represented that the 
limited partnerships and joint ventures would us
e investor funds to (a) acquire ﬁworking 
   2 interestsﬂ in various oil wells and (b) employ enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as fracking, 
to develop and recover oil from the wells.  Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also told investors 
that the entities wo
uld sell the oil in order to earn for investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 
percent, or more, per year ﬁfor decades.ﬂ
 4. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, 
Southern Energy Group, Inc. (ﬁSEGﬂ), which is now adminis
tratively dissolved, and Bl
ack Gold 
Resources, Inc.
, which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc. 
(ﬁBGR/Tennstarﬂ).
 5. Greenlee, Stewart, and Underwood represented 
to investors 
that SEG would 
manage the limited partnerships and 
BGR/
Tennstar would man
age the joint ventures, and that 
each of these companies w
ould be 
headed by an individual with meaningful experience in the oil 
industry.
 6. Greenlee and Stewart 
installed figurehead executives 
for SEG and 
BGR/
Tennstar 
who pretended to run the companies so th
at Greenlee and Stewart
Šboth 
convicted 
felons
Šcould conceal their own involvement in the 
scheme
. 7. Dorrance was the figurehead installed over SEG, and he knew that he was falsely 
portrayed to investors as both running the company and experienced in the oil i
ndustry.
 8.  Dorrance 
also 
substantially assisted the fraud by 
transferr
ing 
investor funds at the 
direction of Greenlee and Stewart 
from SEG accounts 
to accounts that he knew were under 
Greenlee and Stewart™s control
. 9. Dorrance 
received significant 
compensation while serving as the figurehead 
executive for SEG.
      3 VIOLATIONS
 10. Dorrance, by virtue of his conduct
, aided and abetted 
Greenlee™s and Stewart™s 
direct violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
 of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ)
 [15 U.S.C. § 
77q(a)]
 and Section 10(b) of the 
Securities 
Exchange Act
 of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ)

78j(b)], 
and Rule 10b

  15. Dorrance
, age 
61 and a resident of 
Bowling Green
, Kentucky
 was the purported 
President of SEG between January 2015 and 
February 2016, when 
the fraud
ulent offering was 
halted
.  He was selected 
by Greenlee and Stewart as SEG™s figurehead because he was the uncle 
of Greenlee™s spouse and willing to take the job.  For most of his working life, Dorrance was a 
stereo system salesman, who also periodically helped with administrative tasks
 at his spous
e™s 
private place of business
.  He has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
 OTHER 
RELEVANT PEOPLE AND ENTIT
Y 16. David R. Greenlee
, age 
42, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was convicted 
in state court
 and served time in a Kentucky prison during 1999
 to 
2000 for forgery and burglary, 
and again in 2004 for vehicular manslaughter.
 17. David A. Stewart, Jr.
, age 
47, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee,
 is a former 
registered representative of two 
Commission
-registered broker
-dealers
 in 2001 and 2002
.  In 
April 2007, Stewart was convicted of federal income tax evasion and sente
nced to 
federal prison.  
Later, in 2008, the Alabama Securities Commission issued a cease
-and
-desist order against 
Stewart, among othe
rs, for previously participating in a separate oil and gas offering s
cheme
.   18. Southern Energy Group, Inc.
 was a Tennessee corporation and the purported 
manager of at least four limited partnerships offered to investors.  SEG was administratively 
dissolved 
by Tennessee in August 2016 for failure to meet registration renewal requirements.  
 19. On August 11, 2017, the Commission filed a complaint in 
SEC v. Tennstar 
Energy, Inc., et al.
, Cas
e No. 4:17
-cv-00151 (S.D. Ga.),
 alleging 
violation of the antifraud 
statut
es of the federal securities laws 
by 
BGR/Tennstar, 
Greenlee
, Stewart
 and
 Underwood
.      5 FACTS
 A. Background
  20. Between at least January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlee and Stewart, acting 
individually and through a network of salesmen whom they recruited and 
controlled, 
fraudulently sold to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests, called ﬁunits,ﬂ in 
various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell 
oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, an
d Texas.
 21. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee 
corporations
ŠSEG for the limited partnerships and 
BGR/
Tennstar for the joint ventures
Šeach 
of which 
they promoted as being run
 by an individual ex
perienced in the oil industry.
 22. In so
liciting investors, Greenlee
, Stewart
 and Underwood 
represented that the 
limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in 
various oil wells, employ techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil f
rom the wells, 
and sell the oil to earn investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent or more per year, claiming 
returns would last f
or decades.
 23. In fact, while Greenlee and Stewart used some investor money at several wells to 
create an appearance of acti
vity to dupe investors who wanted to see the wells in production, 
they used nearly two
-thirds of the $15 million raised for their own benefit or to pay the costs of 
conducting the fraud, such as adve
rtising and sales commissions.
 24. Greenlee, Stewart and Unde
rwood also represented that SEG was led by an 
individual experienced in the oil industry.  In fact
, SEG, was 
not managed
 by 
someone with 
experience
 in the oil industry.  Instead, 
Greenlee and Stewart installed a figurehead that had little 
   6 or no experience 
in the oil industry and created and distributed 
a false biograph
y that 
misrepresented that 
the figurehead 
had significant relevant experience.
 25. Given their criminal backgrounds, 
Greenlee and Stewart used fake names 
when 
soliciting investors 
to conceal their
 involvement in the scheme.
 B. Dorrance 
Substantially Assisted the Fraudulent Offering 
  26. Dorrance was the figurehead installed by Greenlee and Stewart 
in January 2015 
to 
run SEG.
 27. Dorrance 
was portrayed to investors as 
run
ning 
SEG
 when
, in reality
, that entity 
was controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.
 28. Dorrance knowingly allowed himself to be falsely portrayed to investors as 
running SEG and 
as 
being experience
d in the oil and gas industry.
 29. Specifically, Dorrance knew he was being presented to investo
rs as SEG™s 
President even though he had no actual control over SEG
.  Dorrance also knew that he had b
een 
given this title in order to allow Greenlee and Stewart, both of whom he knew were 
convicted 
felons, to conceal their 
own involvement in the scheme.
 30. Dorrance acted in his role as SEG™s President solely at the direction of Greenlee 
and Stewart, who determined his compensation and instructed him 
in his day
-to-day 
assignments.
 31. Dorrance™s work tasks were typically clerical or administrative in nature and 
included moving investor funds, as instructed by Greenlee and Stewart, from SEG™s bank 
account to bank accounts of entities that he knew to be under the control of Greenlee and 
Stewart.
    7 32. Dorrance also knowingly allowed Greenlee and Stewart to draft 
a fake bio
graphy 
of 
Dorrance and 
place 
that fake biography 
in SEG™s private placement memorandum (ﬁPPMﬂ)
.   Dorrance knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the PPM 
was distributed to 
investors
.  33. This fake biography claimed that Dorrance
 had ﬁover 30 years of experience in 
finance, sales, oil & gas, and almost every capacity of corporate America
.ﬂ  Dorrance knew 
this 
statement was false, at a min
imum
, because he had no work experienc
e in the oil and gas 
industry.
 34. Additionally, Dorrance kn
owingly allowed Greenlee and
 Stewart to feature him 
prominently on SEG™s website and in SEG brochures with false claims, among others, that he 
had ﬁ40 years of business experienceﬂ (10 more years than the claim in the PPM) and 
ﬁassociation[s] with some of 
the most capable and experienced pr
ofessionals in the oil industry.
ﬂ This 
too 
was false because Dorrance had no such associations.
 35. For the approximately thirteen months that Dorrance purportedly 
served as 
 SEG™s President, he received $3,000 a week plus an
 occasional bonus, for a total of 
approximately $166,250
Šall paid from investor funds.

   "
52,52,"On August 30, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Bowling Green, Kentucky-area men with defrauding investors in oil-and-gas securities offerings.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, alleges that Scott Stacy Phelps and James Michael Harper raised approximately $611,000 by selling securities to nine investors between February 2015 and March 2016. Although they told prospective investors that the investment proceeds would be used to drill for oil in Kentucky, the main goal of the offering was to enrich Phelps and Harper. They spent the vast majority of the investor funds on themselves and their families, paying themselves generous six-figure salaries, and using the investor funds for rent, vacations, consumer goods, dating and adult websites, entertainment, golf, and hotels. They used a small amount to drill two wells. Neither well was commercially viable. Despite knowing this, the complaint alleges that Defendants continued soliciting additional funds from investors, purportedly to drill for oil in both wells.

The SEC's complaint charges Phelps and Harper with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Arsen Ablaev, Jonathan Polish and Barry Isenman. The litigation will be led by Jonathan Polish. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kentucky and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

  The United States
 Securities and Exchange Commission (
the 
ﬁCommissionﬂ) 
files this complaint against Defendants 
Scott 
Stacy Phelps and James Michael 
Harper (together 
the 
ﬁDefendantsﬂ)
: 1. This matter involves a fraudulent oil
-and
-gas investment scheme. From 
February 2015 through March 2016, Harper and Phelps raised approximately 
$611,000 
by 
selling 
securities to nine
 investors. 
 2.
 Defendants told prospective investors that investment proceeds would 
be used to drill for oil in ﬁprovenﬂ fields in Kentucky. These representations were 
false. Harper and Phelps spent the vast majority of 
the investor funds on themselves 
and their families
. They paid themselves generous six
-figure ﬁsalaries.ﬂ Defendants 
Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 1 of 10 PageID #: 26536   2  used the investors™ money to pay their rent; to take vacations; to buy consumer 
goods, a firearm and ammunition, and auto parts. They 
also 
spent the money on 
dating and adult websites, entertainment, golf, and hotels. 
 3.
 Although they spent a 
small
 amount to drill two wells on two different 
properties, neither of them was 
a ﬁprovenﬂ 
field, 
and 
neither 
well 
was commercially 
viable
. Despite that,
 Defendants
 continued soliciting additional funds from investors, 
purportedly to drill for oil in both wells.
 4.
 The Commission seeks 
to 
permanently 
enjoin Defendants from 
engaging in such misconduct, to disgorge their ill
-gotten gains, and to pay penalties, 
among other relief.

effective and equal control over Phoenix™s expenditures, business decisions, and 
dealings with third parties
. FACTS
 The Offering
s 12.
 From at least February 9, 2015 through March 2016, 
Harper and Phelps 
cold
-called 
potential investors
, most of whom resided
 outside of Kentucky,
 using 
ﬁlead lists
ﬂ obtained from third parties.
  13.
 Defendants told 
prospective 
investors 
that 
their 
investment 
would be 
used 
to drill 
for oil 
on the ﬁprovenﬂ 
Lee 
Miles 
lease in Hart Count, Kentucky
. They 
touted 
Phoenix 
as a 
low
-overhead
 operation. 
 14.
 Once a prospective investor expressed interest, 
the investor 
received 
offering materials
 Œ documents that 
Harper and Phelps revised, reviewed, approved
, and 
caused to be 
disseminated
. In 
these 
offering materials, Defendants 
reiterated 
that 
Pho
enix would use the invested funds to drill for oil.
  15.
 Defendants offered different investment opportunities
. The 
ﬁPhoenix 3 
Selectﬂ investment concerned the 
sale 
of seven ﬁunitsﬂ in three new wells to be 
drilled by Phoenix on Phoenix
-selected oil and gas le
ases in Hart
 County
, Barren 
County 
or Monroe 
County
. In the offering documentation, Defendants represented 
Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 26539   5  that 
the main purpose of the enterprise was to develop the ﬁproven Lee Miles 
lease
ﬂ in Hart 
County, Kentucky. 
 16.
 The 
ﬁPhoenix 3 Preferredﬂ investment 
concerned the sale of 
seven 
ﬁunitsﬂ in three new wells to be drilled by Phoenix on the Miles lease. 
 17.
 Both offering documents contained a joint venture and a joint operating 
agreement
. Under the terms of 
those
 agreement
s, each investor 
Œ referred to as 
a ﬁWo
rking Interest Partnerﬂ and 
a ﬁNon
-Operatorﬂ 
Œ receive
d a 14% per unit 
working interest in
, and 
a 10% per unit net revenue interest in and to
, the oil and gas 
produced from the Miles lease
. Phoenix
 received a specified 
net revenue interest in 
the oil and g
as produced
, in 
return for 
which it 
would 
overs
ee the drilling operations 
ﬁwith diligenceﬂ and ﬁus[ing] its best efforts
.ﬂ  18.
 Still another 
Phoenix 
investment opportunity
, an Overriding Royalty 
Interest
 (ﬁORIﬂ)
 in all of Phoenix drilling operations,
 offered 
investors 
ﬁa guarantee 
of at least 6%ﬂ return on investment
 for the first year
. Investors were told that 
the
ir 
money 
would be ﬁused to further the growth of Phoenix
.ﬂ  Defendants
™ Spend
ing of
 Investor 
Proceeds on Themselves
 19.
 Defendants
 told 
investors the
ir 
money 
would be used for 
the 
oil
 drilling 
operations. 
Phoenix 
promised to 
work with diligence
, and 
to 
use its best efforts
, drill
ing
 for oil
. But Defendants
™ primary focus 
was self
-enrichment. 
Of the $611,000 
Defendants
 raised from 
investors, they spent
 no 
more than 
ten percent
 to 
drill for oil
 or 
for 
other legitimate business expense
s.  Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 26540   6  20.
 Harper and Phelps spent the vast majority of the investor funds on 
themselves and their families. 
Harper and Phelps paid themselves 
purported
 ﬁsalariesﬂ totaling $112,661 an
d $118,002, respectively. They 
also 
used more than 
$100,
000 of 
the investors™ money on resorts, amusement parks, golf, jewelry, dating 
and adult websites, auto parts, gas, groceries, clothing, 
and 
online gambling, 
among 
other things
. Defendants also used i
nvestment proceeds to pay their agents to solicit 
new investors.
 21.
 Defendants
 and their agents 
offered investors 
little 
in return
, spending 
most of their time golfing, 
engaging in other recreational activities
, and soliciting 
fresh 
investment
 proceeds
 to fin
ance their lifestyle
.  22.
 Defendants 
also used 
new
 investment proceeds 
to 
make 
Ponzi
-like 
payments to 
existing 
investors.
 Such payments perpetuated Defendants™ fraudulent 
operation
, encouraging 
additional 
investments while
 discouraging redemptions
. Defendants
 represented that these payments 
were 
ﬁORIﬂ
 payments, leading i
nvestors  
to believe that these payments
 were 
oil production revenue from Phoenix™s wells. 
In 
fact, Phoenix never made a penny of 
oil 
revenue. 
 Defendants™ 
Other 
False Statements
 to Investors
 23.
 Defendants 
described the Miles lease 
to investors 
as 
ﬁprovenﬂ or 
a ﬁproven field
.ﬂ But 
no wells 
had been 
drilled on 
th
at lease
 before Phoenix drilled 
a single, 
non-producing well.
  Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 26541   7  24.
 Defendants 
also 
raised additional funds from 
two investors 
for 
payments for 
ﬁcompletionﬂ and ﬁacid treatmentﬂ for one well before that well was 
actually drilled, falsely representing 
that the well
 was already 
ﬁ[blowing] 
nice quality 
oil.ﬂ
 Defendants 
did not
 use the investment proceeds for such purposes.
 25.
 Although 
Defendants
 spent a
 small
 amount to drill two wells on two 
different properties, 
neither well was commercially viable
. Defendants
 knew
, or were 
reckless in not knowing,
 that 
neither well was 
commercially viable.
 Despite that, 
they continued soliciting additional funds from i
nvestors
, purportedly to drill for oil 
in both 
wells.
 26.
 Phelps 
lied to investors in other ways as well. 
During golf games
 he 
would 
text investors 
that he was ﬁin the 
field
ﬂ or ﬁstaking [out] well locations
.ﬂ He 
told 
one investor that he was travel
ing
 to Cana
da for a conference with ﬁourﬂ 
Canadian investors
. But 
Phoenix 
had no 
investors
 in Canada

53,53,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former Chief Commercial Officer of Redwood City, Calif.-based Qualys, Inc., a cloud security and services company, with insider trading by tipping his brothers in advance of the company's announcement of poor financial results, thus helping them avoid losses of over half a million dollars.

According to the SEC's complaint, Amer Deeba gifted his two brothers Qualys shares in 2005. The SEC alleges that on April 7, 2015, Deeba learned that Qualys had missed its internal Q1 2015 sales forecast, which served as a basis for the revenue guidance the company provided to the market. According to the SEC, the next day, Deeba informed his two brothers about the miss and contacted his brothers' brokerage firm to coordinate the sale of all of his brothers' Qualys stock. When Qualys publicly announced its financial results, it reported that it had missed its previously-announced first-quarter revenue guidance and that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward.  On the same day, Deeba sent a message to one of his brothers saying, ""We announced the bad news today."" The next day, Qualys's stock price dropped 25%. Although Deeba made no profits from his conduct, Deeba's brothers collectively avoided losses of $581,170 by selling their Qualys stock.

After seventeen years at Qualys, Deeba resigned his position as a senior leader and officer of Qualys on August 2, 2018. Under the terms of his settlement, which is subject to court approval, he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-reporting company for two years and he will pay a $581,170 penalty.

To settle the SEC's charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, Deeba has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew G. Meyerhofer and supervised by Tracy L. Davis of the San Francisco office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","   COMPLAINT

guidance, that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downwar
d, and that the growth rate of its largest business segment had declined.  The next day Qualys
™s stock price fell 25%.  As a result of Deeba tipping his brothers with material 
nonpublic information, both brothers so
ld all of their Qualys shares ahead of the announcement and avoided losses of $456,636 and $124,534, respectively.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE

28 OTHER RELEVANT ENTITI
ES AND INDIVIDUALS 
9. Qualys, Inc. is a provider of cloud security, compliance, and related services 
incorporated in Delaware with its principal place 
of business in Redwood City, California.  At all 
relevant times, Qualys™s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 
12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁ
Exchange Actﬂ) and was quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker QLYS. 
10. Brother 1 is an engineer residing in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.  He is 
Deeba™s older brother and a citizen of Lebanon.   11. Brother 2 is a doctor residing in Beirut, Lebanon.  He is Deeba™s younger brother and a citizen of Lebanon. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. Background 12. Deeba worked at Qualys from 2001 to 2018 
and was an important member of the 
company™s leadership team.  Hi
s responsibilities included running Qualys™s marketing division, 
overseeing Qualys™s alliances with its distributor
s, vetting potential acquisitions, negotiating deals 
with prominent customers, and assisting with the 
preparation of the company™s quarterly earnings 
releases.  During the time period relevant to th
is action, Deeba was the only senior executive at Qualys with a workstation near Qualys™s CE
O, and the two executives spoke frequently. 13. Deeba is close with his two brothers, and he speaks with them often.  Brother 1 provided significant financial assistance to Deeba during college and gr
aduate school.  Deeba in turn 
provided significant financial assistance to Brother 2 during and after medical school. 
14. In 2005, Deeba gifted his brothers Qualys stock.  After Qualys went public in 2012, Deeba arranged for a brokerage firm (the ﬁBrokerage
 Firmﬂ) to open accounts for each of his brothers 
to hold their Qualys shares.  The only securities that the brothers™ accounts ever held were the Qualys shares that Deeba had gifted to them in 2005.   Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 3 of 7  COMPLAINT

28 B. Qualys™s Insider Trading Policy 15. In 2012, Deeba received a copy of Qualys™s insider trading policy.  Deeba was aware that he had a duty not to trade Qualys shares on material nonpublic in
formation gained in the course of his employment or share such 
information with others outside
 the company who might trade. 16. Qualys™s insider trading policy specifically warned employees that ﬁdisclosing 
material nonpublic information dire
ctly or indirectly to others who then trade based on that information or making recommendations or expressing 
opinions as to transactions in securities while 
aware of material nonpublic informati
on (which is sometimes referred to 
as ‚tipping™) is . . . illegal.ﬂ C. Deeba Tips His Brothers, Who Sell All Their Qualys Stock 17. In early February 2015, Qualys forecasted 
internally that Q1 2015 sales would be 
$42.6 millionŠrepresenting 28% year-over-year growth. 
18. On February 9, 2015, Qualys publicly announced that it expected Q1 2015 revenue to be between $37.6 million and $38.1 million and that it 
expected full-year 2015 revenue to be between 
$167.3 million and $169.3 million.  Qualys derived thes
e public revenue guidance numbers, in 
substantial part, from the nonpublic sales forecast 
it had prepared.  At all relevant times, Qualys 
treated its sales figures as nonpublic, confidential information. 
19. Qualys™s internal sales results were ma
terial information.  Qualys employees 
considered the internal sales forecast and internal
 sales data to be an important metric for the 
company and often viewed it as a barometer of the 
business.  For example, Qualys™s former Chief 
Financial Officer described the company™s sales figur
es as the company™s ﬁprincipal determinant of 
revenue.ﬂ  Qualys™s former Vice President of Fina
nce described them as a ﬁleading indicatorﬂ of the 
health of Qualys™s business. 20. Qualys™s CEO had a practice of sharing quarter-end sales results with Deeba before 
Qualys announced its results to the market.  For ex
ample, after three of th
e four quarters in 2014, the CEO emailed the quarter-end sales results to Deeba 
within three days of th
e end of the quarter.  21. Qualys™s Q1 2015 ended on March 31.  On April 2, Qualys™s Vice President of Finance sent an email to Qualys™s CEO showi
ng that the company had achieved Q1 2015 sales Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 7  COMPLAINT

28 growth of 23.6%, representing about $41 million in sales.
  This was lower than the internal forecast 
of $42.6 million, which would have 
equated to 28% growth.   
22. Late in the day on April 7, Deeba spoke with Qualys™s CEO by telephone for twenty minutes.  At the time, Deeba was in Lebanon visiting 
his family.  Deeba learned of Qualys™s Q1 2015 
sales miss during this call. 
23. The next day, on April 8, Deeba tipped his brothers about the sales miss.  That 
morning, he called Brother 1, and the two spoke by telephone for 11 minutes.  D
eeba also sent a text message to Brother 2, asking him to give Deeba a call. 
24. Later on April 8, just four minutes afte
r the U.S. stock markets opened, Deeba 
contacted his financial advisor at the Brokerage Firm and told him that 
he wanted to coordinate trades for his brothers.  Deeba then called Brother 2. 25. A few minutes later, Deeba had a nine-and-
a-half-minute telephone call with a broker 
in the Brokerage Firm™s international group, whic
h was responsible for maintaining Brother 1 and 
Brother 2™s brokerage accounts.  Immediately after 
that call ended, the broker with whom Deeba had 
been speaking placed orders to sell all of Brothe
r 1 and Brother 2™s Qualys stock.  Brother 1 sold 
42,164 shares of Qualys stock, and Brother 2 sold 
11,499 shares of Qualys stock.  According to the broker, Brother 1 and Brother 2 each instructed the broker to
 sell their respective shares. 
D. Qualys Reveals Its Q1 2015 Financial Results 26. On May 4, 2015, after the U.S. markets had cl
osed, Qualys publicly announced its Q1 2015 financial results.  The company revealed th
at it had missed the low end of its previously-
announced Q1 2015 revenue guidance range by $100,000.  At the same time, the company 
announced that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward, from $167.3 million - 
$169.3 million to $165 million - $166.5 million.  Qualys al
so disclosed that the growth rate for its 
largest business segment had declin
ed.  That same day, after the 
earnings announcement, Deeba sent 
a text message to Brother 2, stating, ﬁWe announ
ced the bad news today.ﬂ  The following day, Qualys™s stock price dropped 25%. 27. By selling their stock on April 8, Brother 1 and Brother 2 avoided losses of $456,636 
and $124,534, respectively, totaling $581,170 in losses avoided. Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 5 of 7  COMPLAINT

COMMISSION 
 Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 7 of 7"
54,54,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 1 Global Capital LLC and its former chief executive officer for allegedly defrauding at least 3,400 retail investors, more than one-third of whom invested their retirement funds. The Florida-based cash advance company and former CEO Carl Ruderman allegedly fraudulently raised more than $287 million since 2014 in unregistered securities sold through a network that included barred brokers.

On August 23, 2018, the Honorable Judge Beth Bloom of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze against Ruderman and other Ruderman companies charged by the SEC as relief defendants. The Court also granted the SEC's request to appoint a receiver over certain of the relief defendants - Bright Smile Financing, LLC, BRR Block, Inc., Digi South, LLC, Ganador Enterprises, LLC, Media Pay LLC, and Pay Now Direct LLC. The Court scheduled a hearing for September 7, 2018, for Ruderman and the relief defendants to show cause, if any, why the asset freeze Order should not continue for the pendency of the litigation or until otherwise ordered by the Court.

According to the SEC's complaint unsealed yesterday, although investors were promised profits from 1 Global's loans to small and mid-sized companies, a large portion of their money went to Ruderman's lavish personal spending and to his consumer-loan companies, Bright Smile Financing LLC and Ganador Enterprises LLC, which had nothing to do with 1 Global's cash advance business. Investors in 1 Global allegedly were given bogus account statements and were falsely told that it had an independent auditor, and that its secured loans, typically for small amounts, had low default rates. According to the complaint, in contrast to what it told investors, 1 Global marketed itself to business borrowers as a low-hassle way to access cash quickly, often made large, unsecured loans, and had significant problems with collections. 1 Global declared bankruptcy in July and Ruderman resigned from the company.

The SEC's complaint charges 1 Global and Ruderman with violations of Sections 5(a), (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Action of 1934 (""Exchange Act""). Additionally, the complaint charges Ruderman with aiding and abetting 1 Global's violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and with violating Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest from the defendants and relief defendants, and financial penalties against the defendants.

The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Gary Miller and Mark Dee in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Elisha L. Frank and Fernando Torres. The SEC's litigation is being led by Christopher Martin and Robert K. Levenson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the Colorado Division of Securities.

The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and confirm their identity."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA CASE NO.

UNDER SEAL ,_ FILED BY 1.1!/ o v .c. AUG 2 3 
2018 STEVEN M. LARIMORE CLERK US. DIST CT S.D. OF FlA. FT lAUD. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows: I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Commission brings this action as the result of a four-year-long unregistered securities offering fraud conducted by Defendant 1 Global Capital LLC, and overseen by Defendant Carl Ruderman, that victimized thousands of investors nationwide, many of whom used their retirement savings to invest. From no later than February 
2014 until July 27, 2018, 1 Global (also referred to as ""the Company""), a private, South Florida firm, fraudulently raised more than $287 million from more than 3,400 investors to fund its business of offering short-term financing to small and medium-sized businesses. Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 1 of 34 2. 1 Global used a network of barred brokers, registered and unregistered investment advisers, and other sales agents -to whom they paid millions in commissions -to offer and sell unregistered securities to investors in no fewer than 25 states. The Company, through its marketing materials distributed to sales agents and the sales agents themselves, promised investors a high-return, low-risk investment in which 1 Global would use investor money to make short-term cash advances called Merchant Cash Advances (""MCAs"") to businesses that could not obtain more traditional financing such as bank loans. The Company touted a rigorous underwriting process through which it purportedly approved only one in ten merchants who applied for a loan, and an electronic collection process that would allow investors to make a profit. 3. In reality, the Company used substantial investor funds for purposes other than the cash advances, including paying operating expenses and purchasing already-distressed, term credit card debt. In addition, 1 Global and Ruderman misappropriated at least $35 million of investor money, at least $28 million of which was paid: (1) directly to Ruderman, Relief Defendant Ruderman Family Trust, and other entities he owned or controlled; (2) to companies owned or operated by Ruderman's relatives and acquaintances that had nothing to do with 1 Global's cash advance business; and (3) to fund Ruderman's lavish expenses such as a luxury vacation to Greece and monthly payments for his Mercedes Benz. 4. 1 Global and its sales representatives also made numerous other material misrepresentations and omissions to investors, including: (1) deceptively claiming the Company would only use investor money to fund MCAs; (2) falsely representing the amount of investor money the Company would take for its own use; (3) sending monthly account statements to investors that falsely represented their portfolio balances, rates of return, and the amount of their 2 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 2 of 34 cash 1 Global had in the bank to fund merchant loans; and ( 4) falsely representing the Company had an independent auditor that had endorsed certain aspects of the Company's business model. 5. Largely as a result of 1 Global and Ruderman's misappropriation and improper use of investor funds, by no later than October 2017 1 Global experienced a shortage of investor funds approximating $23 million that should have been in the Company's bank accounts and available for merchant loans. This shortfall continued and increased with time, so that by June 30, 2018, 1 Global's financial records showed approximately $50 million in missing investor funds. 6. Less than a month later, 1 Global and a sister company, Relief Defendant 1 West Capital LLC (which 1 Global used to make merchant loans in California), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, placing investors at risk of losing significant funds. An independent management team is now operating 1 Global and 1 West. 7. Ruderman founded 1 Global, 
was its chairman, and functioned for the entirety of its operations as its Chief Executive Officer. He maintained sole operational control over the Company, closely monitored its fundraising from investors and the merchant loan process, and made all key management decisions. Although Ruderman 
is no longer associated with 1 Global, he continues to control or have access to entities that received misappropriated investor funds from 1 Global. 8. Through their conduct, 1 Global and Ruderman violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and Section 17(a) ofthe Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c) and 77q(a), and Sections 
10(b) and 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and 78o(a)(l) and 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5. Additionally, Ruderman aided and abetted 1 Global's violations of Section 1 O(b) and Rule 1 Ob-5 of the 3 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 3 of 34 Exchange Act. As 1 Global's control person, due to 1 Global violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, Ruderman also violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78t(a). The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both Defendants, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest against the Relief Defendants. Simultaneously with filing this Complaint, the Commission also seeks emergency relief, including the appointment of a Receiver over certain Relief Defendants and an asset freeze against Ruderman and certain Relief Defendants. II. DEFENDANTS AND RELIEF DEFENDANTS A. Defendants 9. 1 Global is a Florida limited liability company headquartered in Hallandale Beach and formed in 2013. Corporate records show the Company is owned entirely by the Ruderman Family Trust. Until July 27, 2018, Ruderman was its Chairman and CEO.

Through June 2018, Pay Now Direct received approximately $5.3 million in investor funds from 1 Global and the Ruderman Family Trust for no consideration or legitimate services. 18. The Ruderman Family Trust is a Florida trust instrument dated June 2, 2014, created to administer certain Ruderman assets. Ruderman is the grantor, his brother-in-law is the 6 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 6 of 34 trustee, and Ruderman's wife and children are the beneficiaries. Through April 2018, the Trust received approximately $4 million in investor funds from 1 Global for no consideration or legitimate services. III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 19. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b ), 20( d), and 22(a) ofthe Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a), and Sections 21(d), 2l(e), and 27 ofthe Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa. 20. This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants and Relief Defendants and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida as Ruderman resides in the District and 1 Global and all of the Relief Defendants used addresses in this District and conducted their business in this District. In particular, 1 Global's operations were located in the Southern District, and Ruderman and other Company officers conducted, supervised, and managed all aspects of 1 Global's fundraising and MCA business at 1 Global's Hallandale Beach headquarters. 21. The Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint. IV. 1 GLOBAL'S MERCHANT CASH ADVANCE BUSINESS 22. Ruderman founded 1 Global in 2013, purportedly seeking ""a better growth opportunity for his family's funds."" By 2018, the Company had grown to more than 100 employees in sales, underwriting, collections, finance, technology and lawyers. 23. Ruderman was a hands-on Chairman and CEO, personally overseeing all aspects of the Company's operations. There was no board of directors or any other high-level executive 7 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 7 of 34 with decision-making authority. Ruderman knew at all times how much 1 Global had raised from investors and received a daily report showing how many cash advance transactions the Company had funded. Ruderman signed 1 Global's agreements with third-party sales agents to allow them to offer and sell 1 Global's unregistered securities. He thus was responsible for the terms of those agreements, which specified the sales agents' compensation and required 1 Global to approve all marketing materials and sales brochures the agents used. 24. Ruderman also personally directed or approved all of the Company's maJOr transactions, including an approximate $40 million loan to a California automotive firm and the $50 million purchase of distressed credit card debt, the latter of which was not an allowed use of investor funds. He carefully monitored account statements the Company sent to investors each month, approved sending them, and knew they contained false statements about the value of investors' portfolios and rates of return. He directed bad debt reserve amounts, ordered investor funds sent to himself and companies his family owned, and told one employee who questioned those transactions it was his company and he could do what he wanted with investor money. 25. In fact, Ruderman was so involved in the Company that he bragged in an email to an executive of a hedge fund that gave 1 Global a line of credit in 2016 ""I'm personally on top of all operations from Sam thru 6:30pm everyday!"" 26. Until it ceased operations on July 27, 2018, 1 Global was in the business of funding MCAs -short-term loans to small and medium-sized businesses. According to its marketing materials and website, 1 Global provided these businesses with an alternative source of funding to traditional bank loans and other financing methods, which it touted as insufficient to meet the short-term needs of smaller businesses. 27. 1 Global contracted with 100 to 200 third-party vendors to find merchants 8 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 8 of 34 interested in applying for cash advances. 1 Global paid those companies a finder's fee for each merchant who received a cash advance. The amount of each finder's fee varied, depending on the loan amount, the third party's track record with 1 Global, 
and other factors. 1 Global determined the amount of the finder's fee in each instance. Through April 2018, 1 Global paid third parties who solicited merchants approximately $15 million in finder's fees for their efforts. 28. Once a finder located an interested merchant, the merchant would apply directly to 1 Global for a cash advance. In marketing materials 1 Global sent to sales agents to use in soliciting investors, 1 Global touted a comprehensive underwriting process and stressed that it only approved loans to one out of every ten merchants who applied. 29. The Company indicated in its 
marketing materials that it used a variety of methods to weed out risky loan candidates, including internet research, credit checks, specific programs for background checks and business analysis, a review of bank records and other documents, and, most importantly, personal contact with every merchant before the Company made an advance. 30. The Company's materials also reported that 1 Global's MCAs were typically small, averaging $68,000. The typical repayment term was anywhere from four months to one year. The MCAs were purportedly made against a business' future cash receivables, and merchants agreed to make daily payments via electronic (ACH) debiting from their business operating bank accounts as they received payments from their customers or vendors. 31. 1 Global's materials also touted a consistently low default rate, specifically stating that its average annual loan write-off rate was only 4%. In addition, the Company told investors and others that approximately 30% of the merchants it loaned money to refinanced their loans. 32. In reality, the Company's MCA process was not nearly so rigorous and its cash 9 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 9 of 34 advance business functioned much differently. In contrast to its claim that its average loan amount was $68,000, 1 Global often made loans of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. In one instance, 1 Global made an MCA of approximately $40 million to a single California automobile dealership-a transaction Ruderman personally directed. 33. The Company also had far more difficulty collecting from merchants than it publicly disclosed. For example, in 2016, 210 of the approximately 1,166 MCAs 1 Global funded, a total of 18%, were the subject of collection lawsuits. In 2017, 328 of 1 Global's 2,092 MCAs, a total of 15%, were the subject of collection lawsuits. 34. Additionally, the Company's website told a far different story than the thorough underwriting process 1 Global touted to investors and elsewhere. The website stressed how simple and quick it was for merchants to obtain loans, noting that the MCAs were unsecured business cash advances. The website consistently promised merchants they could execute an MCA and ""have your money in as little as 24 hours."" 35. The website also promised merchants that ""If you own a business and need cash fast, we're the company to call,"" going on to promise ""We can provide the money you need without the hassles and hoops other financial institutions put you through ... You do not have to come to us hat in hand with scads of paperwork proving your credit worthiness only to have your application denied. We fund 90% of the businesses that apply without basing it on their credit scores ... We have the resources and the commitment to get you that unsecured advancement you need immediately."" Emphasis added. 36. Through April 2018, 1 Global and 1 West made about $348 million in merchant cash advances involving approximately 4,000 MCAs. As of that same date, merchants had repaid approximately $241 million of that amount. As of April2018, due to collectability issues 10 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 10 of 34 and the Defendants' misappropriation of investor funds, 1 Global owes investors at least $272 million but only had $27.5 million in its 
bank accounts. 1 Global does not currently have enough funds to repay investors and filed for bankruptcy in July 2018. V. 1 GLOBAL'S SOLICITATION OF INVESTOR FUNDS A. The Network Of Sales Agents 37. 1 Global funded its MCA business and its operations almost entirely with money from investors, whom the Company referred to alternately as ""Lenders"" or ""Syndicate Partners."" The only non-investor source of funds for 1 Global came from a $10 million line of credit the Company obtained from a hedge fund in 2016, from which it drew down $9.5 million over several months in 2016 and 2017 to make MCAs at the direction of the hedge fund. The remainder of 1 Global's MCA business derived entirely from investors' contributions. 38. 1 Global found its investors through a second network of sales agents consisting in large part of registered and unregistered investment advisers and former (and in some cases barred) brokers. The Company had dozens of sales agents, to whom it paid commissions usually ranging from .75% to 3% of the amount of investor funds they brought to 1 Global. 39. For example, many sales agents received 3% of every new investment amount they brought in to the Company. If the investment rolled over into another term, most sales agents received an additional .75%. In addition, some sales agents who brought other sales agents into the Company received an additional .75% of every amount their recruited sales agents sold. Through April 2018, 1 Global paid sales agents nearly $9 million in commissions for getting investors to put money into 1 Global. 40. Sales agents signed an Affiliate Agreement with 1 Global outlining their rights and responsibilities in, and compensation for, selling the 1 Global investment. Ruderman signed at least two of these Affiliate Agreements on behalf of the Company, allowing sales agents to 11 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 11 of 34 market the 1 Global investment. The Agreements specified that 1 Global had to provide or approve all marketing materials the sales agents provided to prospective investors. In the Agreements and in meetings and telephone calls, 1 Global stressed that its minimum investment amount was $25,000, and that the investment opportunity was for a limited number of sophisticated investors. 41. In practice, however, 1 Global placed no restrictions on who sales agents could solicit to invest in the Company, and frequently 
waived the $25,000 minimum investment requirement. Sales agents regularly solicited large numbers of their existing clients to invest. In short, the Company accepted money from any and all investors the sales agents could find. As 1 Global's owner, Chairman, and CEO, Ruderman substantially participated in the offer and sale of 1 Global's unregistered securities to the investing public and paying transaction-based compensation to the sales agents by: (1) hiring sales agents; (2) attending due diligence meetings with sales agents; (3) executing at least two Affiliate Agreements; and (4) directing 1 Global to pay the sales agents' commissions. 42. From February 2014 through April 2018, 1 Global received at least $287 million from 3,400 investors located in at least 25 states, with at least 100 investors each located in California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Tennessee. More than one-third of the money came from those who invested through IRAs. In the months after April 2018, 1 Global continued to receive millions of dollars from investors. The funds 1 Global raised were commingled or pooled together into one or more of 1 Global's bank accounts. B. 1 Global's Sales And Marketing Efforts 43. 1 Global regularly provided sales materials to its agents for use in marketing the investment. Those materials included a list of Frequently Asked Questions, a history of the 12 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 12 of 34 Company, and a description of both the MCA program and the investment process. Sales agents used the materials in soliciting clients to invest, attaching them to emails in at least one case and other times using the information in them when they spoke to prospective investors. 44. The marketing materials contained the statements about the purportedly rigorous MCA loan approval and repayment process described earlier in this Complaint. In addition, the marketing materials consistently touted 1 Global's alleged consistently high returns for investors. The Frequently Asked Questions claimed 1 Global investors had averaged ""high single digit"" and ""low double digit"" annual returns. 45. In addition, 1 Global sent copies of actual monthly investor account statements to sales agents to show investors. Those account statements showed returns ranging from 8% to 17% a year. Starting in January 2018, 1 Global changed its marketing materials to tell investors that they would earn a guaranteed minimum of 3% a year, with the possibility of much higher returns. 46. The marketing materials, including the Frequently Asked Questions, also stated that 1 Global collected an average of $1.30 to $1.35 or $1.40 on each dollar it advanced in an MCA. This was the means by which 1 Global and investors both purportedly made a profit. 47. Using this information, sales agents usually told investors 1 Global could earn them high single digit to low double digit returns a year, and at least one sales agent created his own promotional flyer based on the Company's information emphasizing these returns. Both the Company and sales agents stressed that 1 Global offered better returns than fixed instruments such as annuities, and was a safe, short-term alternative to more risky stock market investments. 48. Both sales agents and investors were attracted by these allegedly high profits, with many investors deciding to send money on the basis of them. For example, based on the 13 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 13 of 34 promised high returns, one investor gave almost $1 million from a 401 K retirement plan to 1 Global for MCAs. Another investor invested $135,000 after his sales agent showed him one of the sample client statements that reflected double digit annual returns. That same investor sent in another approximately $150,000 in the ensuing months based on receiving his own monthly account statements showing annual returns of at least 8%. Still another investor contributed approximately 20% of her net worth in two investments in September 2017 and May 2018 based on the promised high rates of return and the profits being shown on her monthly account statements. 49. Although 1 Global told sales agents and investors that it was not selling securities because the notes it gave to investors were allegedly only for nine months, at least one early version of the Company's marketing materials called the opportunity to put money into 1 Global an investment. The cover read ""Putting cash to work for merchants while earning high returns on your investment."" Many investors wrote the word ""investment"" in the memo line of their checks, and 1 Global's marketing materials touted the Company as an investment alternative to annuities and stocks. At least one sales agent repeatedly told clients in emails that he was offering them an investment in 1 Global. C. The Memorandum Of Indebtedness 50. For the vast majority of the four-plus years 1 Global offered and sold its investment, it used an instrument entitled a Memorandum of Indebtedness (""MOl"") as the note or contract between the Company and investors. 51. The MOl termed the investor a ""Lender,"" and identified the Company as the ""Borrower."" The MOl specifically stated that an investor was providing money to 1 Global so the Company could expand its business activities, which it termed the ""Covered Activities."" The 14 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 14 of 34 only specific Covered Activity identified in the MOl was the MCAs. And the only use of investor money the Company identified in its marketing materials was the MCAs. After 1 Global received investor funds, it pooled and commingled them together in non-segregated 1 Global bank accounts. 52. While the MOl stated that it was a nine-month note, for most of the time 1 Global raised money from investors, the MOl also stated the note would automatically roll over into a new nine-month term unless the investor expressly informed the Company in writing at least 30 days before the end of the nine months that he or she did not want the note to roll over. 53. For a brief period in early 2018, 1 Global changed the MOl to provide that the note would mature after nine months unless an investor specifically informed the Company that he or she wanted to renew the investment. However, 1 Global reinstated the automatic rollover provision about two months later as a result of the ""paperwork nightmare"" the revised opt-in procedure was causing. 54. In fact, the overwhelming majority of investors allowed their investments to automatically roll over. One sales agent estimated only six to eight of the hundreds of investors he solicited redeemed their investments after nine months. Company bank records show that as of April 30, 2018, investors had sent more than $287 million to 1 Global, but 1 Global had returned only about $16 million of those funds through redemptions or other payments. 55. Even if an investor redeemed his or her investment after nine months, the note extended beyond nine months because it took 1 Global several months to fully pay out an investor's principal and interest. 1 Global called this period ""the unwinding"" and ""the grace period"" in the MOis. 56. The unwinding period was caused by the way 1 Global used investor money to 15 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 15 of 34 fund MCAs. Rather than use investor funds on a single MCA or a small number of MCAs, the Company gave each investor a small, fractionalized interest in up to hundreds of MCAs. A Company computer system would assign the investor's funds automatically, based on the amount of MCAs that came in daily in the weeks following an investment. Under this system, one MCA would be funded with dozens or even hundreds of investors' funds pooled together. 57. Using this process often resulted in the Company taking months to place all of an investor's funds into MCAs. Thus, if an investor elected to redeem his or her investment after nine months, it could take months after that for the merchants who received the investor's money to fully repay the MCAs. Often the Company would not generate enough money from the MCAs to fully pay redeeming investors, forcing the Company to use new investor funds to pay off redeeming investors. 58. 1 Global did not pay investors the interest or the increase in valuation of their portfolio the Company told them they were earning until the investor cashed out some or all of their investment. Although 1 Global sent investors monthly account 
statements purporting to show each investor's account credited with the interest the investor had earned on MCA repayments, investors did not receive those payments right away. Rather, 
1 Global simply commingled all those investor funds into its various bank accounts and frequently reinvested the investor money into new MCAs. This also allowed 1 Global to misappropriate investor funds. 59. 1 Global eventually memorialized the unwinding period into specific timetables at the beginning of 2018. It informed investors through marketing materials sent to sales agents that if an investor who redeemed had placed less than $250,000 with 1 Global, he or she would be fully repaid in 12 months, three months after the end of the nine-month term. For investments of greater than $250,000, the repayment would take six additional months, making the MOl a 15-16 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 16 of 34 month note. 60. Another key provision of the MOl provided that it was within 1 Global's sole discretion how to use investor money to make MCA loans. In fact, investors had no say in how 1 Global used their money. Investors could not and did not manage their MCA loan portfolios; it was solely up to 1 Global whether and when to use an investor's money to fund 
MCAs and which MCAs to fund. The success of the investment and whether an investor earned profits was solely dependent on 1 Global's decisions on MCA funding and other uses of funds, as well as repayment and collection efforts. 61. The MOl contained a paragraph stating the investor was sophisticated and was ""qualified,"" meaning he or she had a certain income level or net worth. However, 1 Global never enforced this provision, did not restrict who sales agents could offer the investments to, and accepted investments from anyone who wanted to invest, regardless of their net worth, income, or sophistication. 62. Finally, the MOl disclosed 1 Global would charge investors in two ways. The first was a 13% management fee that 1 Global would take from the amount collected from MCA repayments. The second way 1 Global said it would charge investors was to have them reimburse the Company the finders' fees it paid to third parties for finding merchants to take MCAs. The MOl contained only those two ways 1 Global could charge investors. However, in truth 1 Global took far greater amounts from investor funds to pay its operating expenses, and for its"

The SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2014, Richard J. Greenlaw, of Kittery, Maine, raised approximately $500,000 from at least 59 investors by offering securities in 20 cannabis-related entities that he formed, which purportedly sold medical marijuana products that did not contain THC, the chemical compound responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects. According to the complaint, Greenlaw sold ownership interests in the companies by posting advertisements on Craigslist. When prospective investors responded to his online ads, Greenlaw followed up with securities offering documents and sales materials describing the purported marijuana products. No registration statement was on file or in effect with the SEC with respect to this offering of securities.

The SEC's complaint charges Greenlaw and the 20 cannabis-related entities, including: NECS LLC, MaineCS LLC, VTCS LLC, MassCS LLC, NHCS LLC, RICS LLC, CTCS LLC, FLCS LLC, ILCS LLC, IACS LLC, LOUCS LLC, MICS LLC, MNCS LLC, NDCS LLC, NJCS LLC, NYCS LLC, OHCS LLC, PennCS LLC, UPCS LLC, and WICS LLC, with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Greenlaw and the cannabis-related entities consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctions from further violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. In addition, Greenlaw consented to a conduct-based injunction. The settlement also requires Greenlaw to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $340,142 and a civil penalty of $50,000.

  12. NECS
 is 
purportedly 
in the business of 
selling medical marijuana that does not 
contain Tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as ﬁTHCﬂ), the chemical compound responsible for 
most of marijuana™s psychological effects.  
Instead, NECS 
market

 present in 
hemp
, purportedly 
as a therapeutic aid for various medical 
conditions such as pain, nausea, and anxiety
, among others
. 13. In late 
2014, shortly after forming NECS, Greenlaw began 
promoting investment 
opportunities in NECS to prospective investors 
through 
advertiseme
nts on Craigslist
, an 
online
-classified
 advertising
 website.
  Greenlaw described the 
securities 
offering as an opportunity to be 
part of the new medical cannabis industry ﬁwithout getting into marijuana and all of its 
regulations.ﬂ
  During the period December 2014 through May 4, 2018, 
Greenlaw 
posted his 
advertise
ments
 in various regional pages on the 
Craigslist 
website in order to reach prospective 
investors in various states throughout the country
. 14. Originally, 
Greenlaw
 formed
 LLCs f
or 
NECS and 
separate entities in 
each of 
the 
six New England states
.  Greenlaw
 typically 
offer
ed prospective investors
 a 5% share of each 
LLC for $5,000
.  Greenlaw offered 
prospective investors 
quarterly profits equal to the 
percentage of 
each investor™s
 ownership interest (
for example,
 5% of quarterly profits for 5% 
ownership
).  Greenlaw™s valuations 
of the underlying companies 
fluctuated, 
so he offered 
some 
prospective investors 
a 5% interest for as much as $10,000.
 15. Greenlaw 
later 
expanded to additional
 states, 
forming
 LLCs 
for
 Florida, Illinois, 
Iowa, 
Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Wisconsin
, and two 
for
 New York, one upstate and the other for New York City. 
     16. In response to 
inquiries from
 prospective investors who saw 
the Craigslist 
advertisement
s, Greenlaw email
ed prospective investors 
cannabis
-related literature describing 
CBD in further detail
, as well as 
securities 
offering documents, including 
LLC 
documents 
and 
subscription 
agreements
 (an investment document that contains a promise by a company to sell a 
Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 5 of 9    PageID #: 5 6  given number of shares to an investor at a certain price and an agreement by the investor to pay 
that price)
.  In 
certain 
instances, Greenlaw 
mailed the information to
 prospective inves
tors.
 17. Between December 2014 and April 2018, approximately fifty
-nine investors 
signed subscription agreements with Greenlaw
 and 
NECS
 or the 
Cannabis
-Related
 Entities,
 investing 
a total amount of approximately $500,000
.  Greenlaw
 signed 
the subscription 
agreements 
on behalf of NECS and/or the 
Cannabis
-Related
 Entities
 and
 typically transmitted 
signed copies of the completed executed subscription agreements 
to the investors 
either through 
email or by U.S. Mail.
    18. The securities transactio
ns that are the subject of this complaint were not 
registered with the Commission.
 19. Certain of the Commission™s securities registration rules allow for the sale of 
unregistered securities if the investors in the securities offering meet the standards for be
ing an 
ﬁaccredited investor
.ﬂ  An investor may have this status if the investor has 
a certain level of 
income or net worth.  
 20. Each of t
he 
signed 
NECS and 
Cannabis
-Related
 Entities
 subscription agreements 
have a box checked reflecting that the investors are accredited investors because they are a 
director, executive officer, or general partner of the LLC.  Greenlaw either pre
-checked this box 
or asked investors to check it. 
 However, 
the investors were not 
directors, executive officers, or 
general partners
 of the relevant LLCs
.  Greenlaw understood that many of the investors would 
be 
purely 
passive 
investors 
and that they would not be taking any active role in 
managing or 
running of the 
company
 as a director
, executive officer or general partner of the LLC
.  As a 
result, this section of the subscription agreements did not accurately reflect all investors™ 
qualifications as an ﬁaccredited investor.ﬂ
 Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 6 of 9    PageID #: 6 7  21. Further, i
n soliciting investments or otherwise offering for sale unregistered 
securities, 
Greenlaw
 did not 
otherwise take steps to determine whether the investors were 
in fact 
accredited investors.  For example, Greenlaw did not 
ask prospective investors for financ
ial 
information.  
At least 
some
 investors 
were not 
accredited
 investors because they did not meet the 
income or net worth thresholds for accredited investors
. 22. No registration statement is on file 
with the Commission 
or in effect with respect 
to, and no exe
mption applies to, the transactions alleged in paragraphs 1 through 2
1. V. CLAIM FOR RELIEF
 Unregistered Offer and Sale of Securities
 (Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act)
 23. The Commission restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 
22 above.
 24. Defendants
, by engaging in the conduct described above, directly or indirectly 
made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate 
commer
ce, or of the mails, to offer to sell or to sell securities, or carried or caused to be carried 
through the mails or in interstate commerce, by means or instruments of transportation, securities 
for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale, when no r
egistration statement had been filed or 
was in effect as to such securities, and when no exemption from registration was applicable.
 25. By engaging in the conduct described above, 
Defendants
 violated, and unless 
restrained and enjoined, is reasonably likely t
o continue to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the 
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77e(a) and (c)].

  Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 9 of 9    PageID #: 9"
57,57,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a corporation and its principals with conducting a multi-million dollar offering fraud.

The SEC alleges that Nevada-based microcap issuer Intertech Solutions, Inc., which purports to be a project finance and management company for mining operations, William Scott Marshall, and David Naylor raised over $7 million from hundreds of investors throughout the United States and Canada. According to the SEC, Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor misled investors about the value of Intertech’s gold mine interest, Intertech’s timeframe for generating revenue, and commission payments Intertech made to securities solicitors. The complaint also alleges that, at Marshall’s direction, Intertech hired numerous individuals to engage in cold-call solicitations of investors. Finally, Marshall and Naylor allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds, which they used to pay for personal expenses such as such as gym memberships, resort stays, personal medical expenses, and a car Marshall exclusively used.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Nevada, charges Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor with violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint also charges Intertech and Marshall with aiding and abetting violations of the broker registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Intertech, Marshall, Naylor, and relief defendant West Port Energy LLC, a company formed by Marshall and which allegedly received proceeds of the fraud, have agreed to disgorge nearly $7.4 million in proceeds from the alleged fraud, and Marshall and Naylor have agreed to pay civil penalties of $184,767 and $92,383, respectively. Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor have also agreed to permanent injunctions, and Marshall and Naylor have agreed to conduct-based injunctions and permanent officer-and-director and penny-stock bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC wishes to thank FINRA and the various state, federal, and foreign authorities that provided valuable assistance in this matter, including the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.

The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Laurie Abbott, James Thibodeau, and Kenji Kawa, was assisted by Trial Counsel Amy Oliver, and was supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley of the Salt Lake Regional Office.

The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.","  1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  Amy J.

U.S.C. § 78u(d), (e)] to enjoin such acts, 
practices, and courses of business, and to obtain 
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and such other and further relief as 
this Court may deem just and appropriate.
 8. The investments, which took the form of common stock and investment 
contracts, 
offered and sold by Defendants, are each a ﬁsecurityﬂ as that term is defined under Section

 12. Intertech Solutions, Inc.
 (f/k/a Amwest Imaging Inc.) is a Nevada corporation 
formed April 2010 with its principal
 place of business in Scottsdale, Arizona, 
and purports to be 
a project finance and management company for mining operations. 
 13. William Scott Marshall
, age 59, 
maintains residences in Calgary, Canada, and 
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, but also spends considerable
 time in the Phoenix, Arizona area. 
Although never officially an officer or director of ITEC, at all relevant times, Marshall acted as 
ITEC™s undisclosed control person.
 14. David Michael Naylor
, age 54, 
maintains residences in British Columbia, 
Canada, and Ca
bo San Lucas, Mexico, but also spends considerable time in the Phoenix, Arizona 
area. Naylor originally served as ITEC™s 
CEO
 and director, but as of April 28, 2014, assumed the 
role of CFO and director. Naylor is licensed as a Chartered Professional Accountant in Canada. 
 15. West Port Energy LLC
, is a Nevada limited liability company formed on 
August 1, 2013, with its principal pl
ace of business in Scottsdale, Arizona.
 Based on evidence 
presently available, staff believes that Marshall is West Port™s sole member. West Port was 
initially formed to acquire and bring into commercial production the gold mining claims that 
were the subj

 FACTS
 Background
 16. In 
or around 
late 2012, while exploring potential natural resource ventures, 
Marshall became acquainted with
 an individual,
 C.W.
, and learned that 
C.W.
 owned the rights to 
several placer gold mining clai
ms in La Paz County, Arizona.
 Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 4 of 18  5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  17. Marshall proposed that he and 
C.W.
 go in on a business venture in order to 
commercially develop 
C.W.
™s mining claims. 
C.W.
 agreed, and Marshall began 
pursuing
 money
-raising opportunities.
 18. On or around August 1, 2013
, Marshall 
formed West Port and became its sole 
member.
 That same month, 
C.W.
 quitclaimed his La Paz County, Arizona mining claims to West 
Port (
the ﬁWest Port Claimsﬂ)
. 19. In or around October 2013
, Ma
rshall obtained control of ITEC. 
Marshall enlisted 
Naylor
Šwho has a 
history with Marshall and who has been described as Marshall™s ﬁright hand 
manﬂ
Što serve as ITEC™s initial sole officer and director and to receive the controlling block of 
restricted ITEC common stock.
 Although not named an officer or director of ITEC, 
Marshall 
made all 
major
 business decisions for ITEC, 
including 
determin
ing
 how 
ITEC
 would raise and 
spend
 funds, and otherwise controlled ITEC.
 20. On or around November 10, 2013, ITEC and West Port entered into a ﬁFinancing, 
Production & Assignment of Interest 
Agreement,ﬂ pursuant to which ITEC was to obtain the 
necessary funding to 
bring the West Port Claims into commercial gold production in exchange 
for a percentage interest in the gross proceeds of any gold obtained from the West Port Claims.
 ITEC™s Securiti
es Offerings
 21. In or around 
February 2014, ITEC initiated an offering of its common stock, 
which 
it never registered with the Commission.
 22. To facilitate the common stock offering, Marshall and Naylor created offering 
documents such as a private placement memorandum (ﬁPPMﬂ), subscription agreement, and 
offering slide decks, which contained information about the offering and ITEC™s business 
Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 5 of 18  6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  arr
angement with West Port.
 Although both Marshall and Naylor were involved in drafting these 
offering and solicitation documents, Marshall had ultimate control over their contents.
 23. Additionally, Marshall enlisted 
the Solicitors
 to seek out investors on behal
f of 
ITEC
. Marshall also
 determ
ined 
the Solicitors™ 
compensation 
and provided the Solicitors
 with 
the offering documents that they would in turn provide to prospective investors.
 24. The 
Solicitors obtained lead lists of prospective investors who resided 
throughout 
the United States and Canada and used those lead lists to engage in cold
-call solicitations. After 
initiating contact with a prospective investor over the phone, the solicitors typically mailed or 
emailed the PPM, subscription agreement, and sli
de deck to the prospect, and directed the 
prospect to visit ITEC™s website.
 25. Once persuaded to purchase ITEC stock, investors would execute and submit to 
ITEC a subscription agreement and send their investment funds via either check or wire to 
ITEC™s 
bank
 account, and ITEC would direct its transfer agent to
 physically
 issue restricted 
stock certificates.
 26. Using
 the investment funds
 it received 
through its sale of
 common 
stock
, ITEC
, Marshall™s direction,
 paid the S
olicitors commissions ranging from approximately 35% to 50% 
of the total 
investment 
proceeds.
 27. As CFO, Naylor authorized and tracked ITEC™s commission payments.
 28. ITEC ran its common stock offering through December 2016 and raised 
over 
$6 million
 from 
hundred
s of investors
 throughout the United States and Canada.
 29. In addition to offering common stock, beginning
 in or around
 August 2014, ITEC 
also began offering ﬁSale/Purchase and Processing Agreement for In Situ Au Metalﬂ (the ﬁGold 
Contractsﬂ)
. Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 6 of 18  7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  30. The Gold Contra
cts gave investors the right to purchase a specified amount of 
gold from the West Port Claims™ future production at a specif
ied and highly discounted price, 
relative to the then spot price of gold. The Gold Contracts stated that investors would be 
investin
g in gold that was ﬁyet to be minedﬂ and was ﬁcurrently in situ.ﬂ
 31. The Gold Contracts represented that ITEC would deliver the gold 180 day
s from 
the date of the contract and gave investors the option of receiving delivery of physical gold or 
selling the gol
d to ITEC™s designated processing company.
 32. Solicitation documents sent to prospective gold investors
 via mail and/or email
 touted 
the possibility for gold investors to ﬁearn 60% 80% 100% or more return this year
,ﬂ access to the type of investment previousl
y available only to ﬁhigh net worth individuals and 
ventu
re capital firms,ﬂ and the chanc
e for a ﬁdramatic changeﬂ to an investor™s ﬁretirement 
plans.ﬂ
 33. Through its sale of Gold Contracts, ITEC raised over $1 million from at least 50 
investors throughout th
e United States and Canada. Of that amount, I
TEC paid 35% as 
commissions to S
olicitors and pooled the remaining investor funds to purportedly pay for mining 
expenses.
 34. In connection with the offer 
and sale of the subject 
ITEC
 securities, 
Defendants 
ITEC and Marshall 
engaged in
, and Defendant Naylor provided substantial assistance in,
 the 
making of misstatements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to 
make the statements made not misleading
, and 
Defendants ITEC, Marsh
all, and Naylor 
obtained 
money or property from 
ITEC
 investors thereby
. 35. Specifically, through the PPMs, gold contracts, slide decks, and information 
publicized on ITEC™s website, ITEC and Marshall made, and Naylor aided and abetted the 
Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 7 of 18  8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  making of, misstatem
ents or omissions regarding (a) the
 payment of commissions to the 
Solicitors, (b) the value of the West Port Claims, (c) the time required to bring the West Port 
Claims into commercial gold production and to begin revenue generation,
 and
 (d)

trol of ITEC
 and
 ITEC and West Port™s status as related parties.
  36. With respect to the 
payment of commissions to the S
olicitors, the ITEC PPMs 
represented that 10% of investor funds would be used for ﬁDiscounts & Commissions.ﬂ No other 
offering or solicitat
ion document mentioned the payment of commissions. Instead, they disclosed 
only mining related expenses when discussing uses of proceeds. Contrary to these 
representations, ITEC used 35% 
Œ 50% of investor f
unds to pay commissions to the S
olicitors.
 37. ITEC™s 
offering documents also made material misrepresentations regarding the 
value of the West Port Claims. The PPMs and slide decks represented that the West Port Claims 
had a ﬁproven resourceﬂ with a ﬁminimum average gradeﬂ of 2 to 3 grams of gold per ton of 
mining material and that the West Port Claims had a ﬁminimum gross valueﬂ of ﬁ$273 million.ﬂ 
The offering documents failed to mention that these valuation figures were based on limited 
initial testing conducted by West Port and were never confirmed by an in
dependent geologist. 
 38. In 
fact
, A.J.
, the independent geologist 
ultimately 
hired to analyze the West Port 
Claims
, stated in his final, May 2015 
report
, ﬁIt is clear that there has been insufficient 
exploration to define a mineral resource on [the West Port 
Claims]. In particular, . . . the average 
thickness and grade are inadequately known.ﬂ
 39. The offering documents additionally contained material misstatements regarding 
the timeframe within which West Port would begin commercial gold extraction on the West Po
rt 
Claims. The PPMs and slide decks made representations indicating that commercial gold 
Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 8 of 18  9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  production would begin within one year of the date of the offering. Additionally, the Gold 
Contracts stated that ITEC would deliver gold within 180
-days from the date 
of the contract.
 40. However, before West Port could begin commercial gold production, 
it was 
required to
 obtain extensive regulatory approval, including
 submit
ting
 a mining plan of operation 
(ﬁMPOﬂ) to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (ﬁBLMﬂ), obtain
ing
 BLM
 approval of that 
MPO, and obtain
ing
 numerous other federal and state permits
. Based on industry standards, 
completion of this regulatory process could 
take 
anywhere from 
3 to 10 years from the date an 
MPO is submitted to the BLM, depending in part on the size of the mining operation.
 41. In this instance, the BLM did not receive West Port™s MPO until
 at or around 
November 4, 2014
Šseveral months
 after ITEC began disseminating
 offering documents
 that 
represente
d West Port would begin commercial gold operations by the end of 2014.
 42. Although ITEC periodically updated its PPM and other offering documents, those 
documents continued to indicate that commercial gold production and revenue generation were 
only
 months aw
ay.
 43. In reality, the BLM did not approve of West Port™s MPO until at or around 
February 2017. 
In spite of receiving this and other necessary regulatory 
approvals, to date, 
West 
Port
 has yet to begin commercial operations on the West Port Claims, and neither
 West Port nor 
ITEC h
as generated any revenue
. 44. The offering documents also failed to disclose Marshall™s role as ITEC™s control 
person and that ITEC and West Port were related parties, such that their agreement constituted a 
related
-party transaction. The 
PPMs and slide decks each contained a section disclosing ITEC™s 
management; none of those disclosures listed Marshall as ITEC™s control person or even 
mentioned his involvement with the company. 
 Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 9 of 18  10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  45. Likewise, although the PPMs and slide decks represented that
 ITEC had executed 
a ﬁformal definitive gold streaming agreementﬂ with West Port, the documents failed to mention 
that Marshall controlled both ITEC and West Port, that Naylor was involved in the management 
of both entities, and that therefore the agreemen
t between ITEC and West Port was a related
-party transaction. Instead, the offering documents gave the appearance that the agreement 
constituted an arms
-length transaction
 skillfully negotiated by ITEC™s management.
 Misappropriation of Investor Funds
 46. In addition to 
engaging in
 misstatements and omissions, Defendants also 
defrauded investors through the misappropriation of investor funds. 
 47. As discussed above, ITEC used over $3 million of investor proceeds to pay
 exorbitant commissions to the S
olicitors. 
 48. Defendants 
also 
used 
hundreds of thousands of dollars
 of investor funds to pay for 
personal expenses such as gym memberships, resort stays, personal medical expenses, and a 
vehicle used exclusively by Marshall
, as well as to pay for the 
expense
s of other 
entities
 controlled by Marshall or Naylor that provided no goods, services, or other benefit 
to ITEC
. Marshall™s Beneficial Ownership and Sale of ITEC Shares
 49. Simultaneous with his involvement in the above misconduct, Marshall 
surreptitiously ben
efitted from the 
resale of ostensibly unrestricted ITEC shares into the public 
markets.
 50. In or around November 2013, shortly after Marshall obtained control of ITEC, 
ITEC issued 2.5 million unrestricted shares of its common stock to a Belizean entity 
named
 Anvil International Ltd. (ﬁAnvil Belizeﬂ
), purportedly as the result of 
the conversion of a 
promissory note (the ﬁNoteﬂ). 
Although 
Marshall was, in fact, the beneficial owner of the shares

 and controlled 
ITEC, 
Anvil Belize submitted a 
ﬁStatement of 
Non-affiliation
ﬂ in connection with the Note conversion
. 51. Anvil Belize
 deposited the 
ITEC 
shares into a brokerage account in
 its name,
 and 
Marshall directed a nominee 
of his 
to obtain trading authority over Anvil 
Belize™s 
brokerage
 account.
 52. From
 April 2014
 through April 2016
, Anvil Belize 
sold
 all 2.5 million
 ITEC
 shares 
held in its 
brokerage
 account
 into the public markets. 
No registrati
on statement was ever 
filed pertaining to this sale of ITEC shares.
 53. In or around August 2014, Marshall directed Naylor to form a Nevada entity, 
Anvil International Enterprises Ltd. (dba Anvil International Ltd.) (ﬁAnvil Nevadaﬂ), to receive 
the 
funds 
obtained 
from the sale of securities 
out of
 Anvil Belize™s 
brokerage 
account. 
Between 
August 2014 and May 2015, 
Anvil Belize™s brokerage account
 made payments 
of approximately 
$767,000 to 
Anvil Nevada.

 Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 18 of 18"
58,58,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Birmingham, Alabama-based certified public accountant with insider trading on confidential information about the impending merger of two potato chip manufacturers.

The SEC alleges that A. Catlin Cade, IV misappropriated material nonpublic information concerning the merger of potato manufacturer Golden Enterprises Inc. with privately-held Utz Quality Foods, LLC. The SEC alleges that Cade received the information through his work as an accountant providing tax advice for a private company owned by a member of Golden Enterprise's board of directors. Cade immediately purchased 2,000 shares of Golden Enterprises common stock for $22,467, and then sold his entire position immediately after the merger was announced the following day, realizing a profit of $8,745.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, charges Cade with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Cade has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of his profits.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama, and the Alabama Securities Commission in this matter."," IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMABIRMINGHAM DIVISIONSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,Plaintiff, Civil Action No.v.Electronically FiledA.

A. Catlin Cade, IV, age 65, resides in Birmingham, Alabama. Cade is registered as aCertified Public Accountant in Alabama and is a principal of a certified public accounting firm.RELEVANT ENTITIES11. Golden Enterprises, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Birmingham,Alabama. Golden Enterprises's common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant toSection 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was traded on NASDAQ under the symbol ""GLDC"" untilit filed a Notice of Termination of Registration with the Commission on October 13, 2016.12. Utz Quality Foods, LLC is a privately held snack food company based in Hanover,Pennsylvania.FACTS13. A member of Golden Enterprises's board of directors (""Director"") learned materialnonpublic information concerning the contemplated merger agreement between GoldenEnterprises and Utz beginning in November 2015.14. The Director owned and controlled a private company (""Director's Company"") that heldshares of Golden Enterprises's stock. On or about February 22, 2016, the Director sharedmaterial nonpublic information concerning the contemplated merger agreement with anemployee (""Employee"") of Director's Company so that the Employee could assess the associatedtax consequences for the Director's Company.15. Employee, in turn, sought related accounting advice from Cade, whose firm had served asthe Director's Company's outside accountant for over 20 years. As an Alabama-licensedaccountant, Cade had a professional duty to maintain the confidentiality ofhis firm's clients'information.3Case 2:18-cv-01323-JEO   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 3 of 6 16.

61,61,"On August 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against two sales agents for unlawfully acting as unregistered brokers and selling unregistered investments in two oil and gas companies based in Texas.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Alexander Charles White and Paul Douglas Vandivier illegally solicited and raised money from investors for Aegis Oil, LLC and 7S Oil & Gas, LLC. Both of these companies offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of ""joint venture units"" in oil and gas development projects located in Texas.

According to the SEC's complaint, White managed a marketing team that solicited investors for Aegis and 7S. White and his sales team made cold calls to potential investors using investor contact lists. In return, White was paid transaction-based compensation in the form of a 35% sales commission for each investor his team brought on in the Aegis offering and a 28% to 35% commission for each investor in the 7S offering. In total, White received commission payments of about $6.84 million from the Aegis offerings and $229,000 from the 7S offerings. White paid out a portion of those proceeds to his sales team.

The SEC's complaint also alleges that Vandivier managed a sales team that solicited investors for the offerings through his now defunct company, Aegis Marketing, Inc. Vandivier and his marketing team located investors through investor contact lists. Vandivier received commission totaling about $870,000 from the Aegis offerings, a portion of which he paid out to his sales team, and $23,000 from the 7S offerings.

The SEC's complaint charges White and Vandivier with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against White and Vandivier.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Raynette R. Nicoleau, Shan Chang, and Crystal Ivory in the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  The litigation will be led by Russell Koonin."," U

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
 
 
A.
 
Unreg
istered Securities Offerings
 
 
10.
 
Between October 2010 and October 2015, Aegis raised a total of approximately 
$35 million from about 250 investors nationwide through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and 
sales of securities in a continuous series of 15 offerings.

Action No. 16

BB (S.D. Fla., Sept. 29, 2016).
 
11.
 
Between November 2014 and July 2016, 7S
, 
which previously served as the field 
operator for the Aegis projects, began offering and selling its own investments in oi
l well 
projects to 
the public.  During this period, 7S 
raised approximately $7 million from a
t least 70
 
investors through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and sales of securities in a continuous series 
of 
8
 
offerings.

The securities sold in 
all
 
offerings were
 
investment contracts
 
in the form of 


Aegis
 
and 7S
 
offered and 
sold their securities to the public primarily through a network of 
sales agents, who would cold
-
call 
potential investors throughout the country using lead lists.  Aegis
 
generally paid its sales 
agents a 35% commission on each sale, which came o

7S
 
paid its agents comm
issions ranging from 20% to 35%, also out of investor money.  Neither 
Aegis nor 7S disclosed to investors the 
payment
 
of commissions higher than 10%.

13.
 
Sales
 
agents pitched the Aegis
 
and 7S
 
s
ecurities to potential investors based on 
promises of exaggerated rates of return, while minimizing the risks associated with the 
investment.  For example, some of the agents told investors that they would receive returns on 
their investment, ranging from 
15% to 200% on the Aegis units and 20% to 30% on the 7S units.  
Some investors were also told by agents that these investments had virtually no risk because, 
among other things, the projects were already up and running and the wells were located in areas 
t
hat have produced millions of barrels of oil. 
 
14.
 
After the initial phone contact with potential investors, sales agents would 

s
 
would 

mation to the company so that a package of materials, including 
a private placement memorandum (

PPM

) could be mailed out to the investor.  The agents in 

access cert

protected parts of the website
, 
including access to the PPMs.  The PPMs 
for both offerings contained standard boilerplate cautionary language about the investment and 

 
cured the 
misstatements and omissions that were made to investors.

Case 0:18-cv-61870-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 10 of 10"
62,62,"On August 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Chad Anthony Lewis, a Kentucky resident for unlawfully acting as an unregistered broker and selling unregistered investments in two oil and gas companies based in Texas.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Lewis illegally solicited and raised money from investors for Aegis Oil, LLC and 7S Oil & Gas, LLC. Both of these companies offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of ""joint venture units"" in oil and gas development projects located in Texas.

According to the SEC's complaint, Lewis, who worked at different times both for Aegis and 7S, helped train a network of sales agents that unlawfully solicited investments for Aegis and 7S and assisted agents in closing sales calls with investors. The SEC alleges that Lewis directly solicited at least one investor, who purchased investments in both Aegis and 7S. Lewis was paid transaction-based compensation in the form of a sales commission of 2% on all investor proceeds raised through the offerings. He also received commissions ranging from 20% to 31% from the proceeds of the investments he sold to one investor. In total, Lewis received about $374,000 in commission payments from the Aegis offerings and $250,700 from the 7S offerings.

.
 
Between October 2010 and October 2015, Aegis raised a total of approximately 
$35 million from 
approximately
 
250 investors nationwide through the fraudulent, unregistered 
offers and sales of securities in a continuous series of 15 offerings.

.
 
Between November 
2014 and July 2016, 7S
, 
which previously served as the field 
operator for the Aegis projects, began offering and selling its own investments in oi
l well 
projects to the public.  During this period, 7S 
raised approximately $7 million from a
t least 70
 
invest
ors through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and sales of securities in a continuous series 
of 
8
 
offerings.

The securities sold in 
all
 
offerings were
 
i
nvestment contracts
 
in the form of 


.  
Aegis
 
and 7S
 
offered and 
sold their securities to the public primarily through a network of 
sales agents, who would cold
-
call 
potential investors 
throughout the country using lead lists.  Aegis
 
generally paid its sales 

7S
 
paid its agents comm
issions ranging from 20% to 35%, 
also out of investor money.  
Neit
her 
Aegis nor 7S disclosed
 
to investors
 
the 
payment
 
of commissions higher than 10%.

Sales
 
agents pitched the Aegis
 
and 7S
 
securities to potential investors based on 
promises of exaggerated rates of return, while minimizing the risks associated with the
 
Case 0:18-cv-61869-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 3 of 9 4
 
 
investment.  For example, some of the agents told investors that they would receive returns on 
their investment, ranging from 15% to 200% on the Aegis units and 20% to 30% on the 7S units.  
Some investors were also told by agents that these investments ha
d virtually no risk because, 
among other things, the projects were already up and running and the wells were located in areas 
that have produced millions of barrels of oil.

After the initial phone contact with potential investors, sales agents would

a private placement memorandum (

PPM

) could be mailed out t
o the investor.  The agents in 

access certain password

protected parts of the website

including access to the PPMs.  The PPMs 
for both offerings contained standard b
oilerplate cautionary language about the investment and 

misstatements and omissions that were made to investors.

Between September 2013 and July 2016, Lewis worked at different times both for 
Aegis and 7S.  Lewis was recruited by

Lewis 
was hired to train the 

 
network of outside sales agents, which 
entailed traveling to the various sales offices to provide training on the Aegis oil wells.  Lewis 
also acted as the liaison between the sales agents and the fie
ld operator for the various oil well 
projects so 
sales 
agents could get the information they needed when speaking to investors.

Case 0:18-cv-61869-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 9 of 9"
64,64,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers out of nearly $4 million in a long-running investment scam.

According to the SEC's complaint, John C. Maccoll, who was affiliated with the Birmingham, Michigan branch of a nationwide registered broker dealer and investment adviser, used high pressure sales tactics to solicit at least 15 of his retail brokerage customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after private fund investment. Most of the injured customers were elderly and retired and invested through their retirement accounts. Maccoll told his customers that the purported fund investment would allow them to diversify their portfolios, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and give them investment growth potential that was better than the growth they received in their brokerage accounts. As alleged in the complaint, Maccoll's statements to his customers were false - he did not invest the customers' money but stole it for his own personal use. In total, the customers invested nearly $4 million in the fraudulent scheme. To conceal the scheme, Maccoll allegedly instructed his customers not to tell others about the purported fund investment, provided some of his customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns, and paid over $400,000 in Ponzi-like payments to certain of the customers to keep the scheme alive.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today filed criminal charges against Maccoll.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Maccoll with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Maccoll to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Richard G. Stoltz, Craig L. McShane and Anne C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier, Ms. McKinley and Mr. Stoltz. The case is being supervised by Kathryn A. Pyszka. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan and FINRA.","  - 1 - UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

  Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ) 
alleges as follows:
 SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
 1. The Commission brings this civil law enforcement action to address 
Defendant John C
. Maccoll™s (ﬁMaccollﬂ) multi
-million
-dollar securities fraud.
  Between 
approximately 2008 and March 2018, Maccoll defrauded at least 1
5 of his retail brokerage 
customers out of 
nearly
 $4 million.
  During that time period, Maccoll worked as a 
registered re
presentative associated with a large, nationwide broker
-dealer and investment 
adviser dually registered with the Commission (ﬁBroker
-Dealer Aﬂ).
 2. Maccoll
 lied and 
used high pressure sales tactics to solicit
 at least 1
5 of his 
customers 
to invest in what 
he described as a highly
-sought
-after
, alternative
, private 
fund 
investment.  
Maccoll 
represented to customers
 that
 by investing in the 
purported 
fund,
 they 
could 
diversify their portfolio
s, receive 
annual
 investment 
returns 
as high as 
20%, and 
have
 invest
ment growth 
potential 
that 
was better than on the 
securities
 that they held at Broker

.  Maccoll convi
nced the customers to sell or borrow against their 
securities
 at 
Broker
-Dealer A
 and to transfer 
nearly $4
 million 
of the proceeds to him to fund 
the 
investments.  
Maccoll™s statements to his customers were 
false
.  Maccoll 
did not invest the 
customers™ money but 
stole 
the money for his own personal use
.  He spent 
nearly
 $3.6 million on personal expenses
 and 
paid over $
400,000 
to 
certain 
of his custo
mers in 
Ponzi
-like payments to keep his fraudulent scheme alive.
   3. By engaging in this conduct, Maccoll 
violated 
Section
 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ)
 [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] 
and 
Section 10(b) of the Securities

§ 78j(b)] 
and Rule 10b
-5 [17 C.F.R. § 
240.10b-5] thereunder.  
 4. In connection with this lawsuit, the Commission seeks 
a permanent 
injunction against Maccoll to enjoin him from future violations of the above
-cited 
provisions o
f the federal securities laws.  The Commission further seeks an order requiring 
Maccoll to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of 
the 
ill-gotten gains that he 
received through his fraud, along with the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Sec
tion 
20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.

 FACTS
 Maccoll
™s 
Offering Fraud and Misappropriation Scheme
  8. Star
ting in 20
08, Defendant Maccoll began soliciting certain of his 
brokerage 
customers 
to invest in a 
purported 
private,
 alternative
, hedge
-type 
fund that 
Maccoll 
claimed 
was highly
-profitable, exclusive, and outside of 
Broker
-Dealer A™s 
investment platform.  Between 2
008 and 
March 
2018, Defendant Maccoll 
fraudulently 
convinced at least 1
5 customers to sell and/or borrow against securities in their brokerage 
accounts and transfer the proceeds to him for investment in the purported private 
Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10  - 4 - investment.
  In reality, Maccol
l used 
all of 
the funds that he raised 
for his own personal use 
and to make Ponzi
-like payments to certain customers. 
  9. Most of the customers targeted by Maccoll were elderly, retired
, and from 
working
-class or middle
-class backgrounds.  Maccoll had lon
g-standing
 relationships with 
these customers, who trusted him completely to manage their investments.
  10. The customers Maccoll
 targeted 
held tax
-advantaged retirement accounts at 
Broker
-Dealer A
, including IRA accounts, a pension fund conversion, and a 
federal 
government Thrift Savings Plan account rollover.  
One
 customer account included the 
customer™s life savings and money from her deceased husband™s life insurance payout, 
which she intended to use to pay for college expenses for her three children. 
 Maccoll knew 
that the funds invested in 
his 
customers™ accounts were intended for their retirement
 and for 
college expenses
.  11. When 
touting 
his fictitious 
fund investment, 
Maccoll 
used 
the name of a 
real
 family of 
alternative i
nvestment 
fund
s to cloak h
is fraudulent securities offering with 
legitimacy
.  Certain
 customers 
were aware of 
and t
ook comfort from the fact that an 
alternative fund investment 
in the name used by Maccoll actually existed.
   But
, in reality,
 Maccoll had nothing to do with 
the 
real,
 established fund family.  
 12. Maccoll 
told 
some 
of his customers
 that 
an investment 
in the 
purported
 fund 
 would diversify their portfolios.
  13. He 
also 
told 
customers that 
the 
purported
 fund paid returns on investment 
ranging from 10% to 20% each year 
and that the potential for investment growth was better 
than the investments they had made 
in their accounts
 with Broker
-Dealer A
.   Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10  - 5 -  14. Maccoll 
also 
told 
customers that 
the 
purported
 investment 
fund 
was 
exclusive and that he had a unique opportunity to p
lace them in a 
fund 
that otherwise would 
not be open to small, retail investors.  
 15. Maccoll told customers that that they were privileged to have an opportunity 
to invest because Maccoll was only offering 
the opportunity 
to a limited number of select 
clients.
  16. Maccoll applied pressure by telling customers that they had to act fast
 because 
the investment opportunity he offered 
was only open during short windows of time.  
Maccoll told one customer that if she decided not to invest, she would lose the o
pportunity 
in the future and he would find someone else.
 17. Maccoll told customers that their funds would be ﬁlocked upﬂ and 
 unavailable for withdrawals for a certain amount of time, and that they only could make 
additional investments in the fund when i
t was open for investment.
  He also told customers 
that they should expect little information directly from the fund 
including 
a prospectus, 
trade confirmations, or account statements.  
 18. In order to hide his fraud from 
Broker
-Dealer A
 and others, Macco
ll instructed his
 customers not to tell others about the fact that they had invested their funds in 
the 
purported
 fund investment because he could not open the offering to everyone.
 19. Maccoll 
fraudulently convinced
 his customers to sell 
securities held i
n their
 accounts 
or 
to open 
and draw down on 
a line of credit within their accounts
, using their 
securities as collatera
l, in order to finance the investments
.  He then 
instructed 
his 
customers 
to deposit or wire the 
proceeds from these transactions
 into t
heir personal bank 
accounts.
  Once
 the funds were in his customers™ personal bank accounts, Maccoll told the
 Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10  - 6 - customers
 to 
write check
s for their investments 
payable to ﬁMac 011ﬂ or ﬁMac 01
.ﬂ  Maccoll picked up the checks from his customers™ homes, 
added hi
s first name to the payee 
line
, and 
then 
deposited the check
s into his personal 
bank account
, over which he had sole 
control
.    20. Most of Maccoll™s customers did not ask for account statements or other 
documentation related to their purported investment
 and instead
, accepted Maccoll™s oral 
descriptions of the performance of the investment.  
  21. However, 
as part of his 
scheme
, Maccoll created and provided 
some of his 
customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns in connection with
 his 
fraudulent fund offering.  
  22. Maccoll
 acted deliberately, with the intent to deceive.  
He 
knew 
that 
the
 investment
 he described to 
his 
customers did not exist, and he 
never invested any of the 
money he raised from 
his 
customers in 
the promised inve
stment.  
  23. As a result of Maccoll™s false and misleading statements, at least 1
5 customers transferred 
nearly
 $4 million to Macoll.  
 Maccoll™s Misappropriation
 of Investor Funds
  24. Instead of using his customers™ funds as promised, Maccoll misapprop
riated 
the 
nearly $4
 million he raised, including at least 
$3,406,003
 between 
August 2018
 and 
March
 2018. In an attempt to keep the scheme alive,
 Maccoll used approximately 
$411,529 of the funds to make Ponzi
-like payments to at least six of his customers
 between 
November 2013 and March 2018
.  He used the remaining funds for his personal benefit.
    25. By 
April
 2018, Maccoll had less than $
7,000 remaining in his bank accounts.

Was Uncovered
 26. Maccoll™s scheme began to crumble in the fal
l of 2017, when one of his 
customers began asking Maccoll to provide him with documentation and online access for 
his investment.  In February 2018, after 
numerous 
requests, Maccoll finally sent 
the 
customer 
a fax containing a
 purported
 account statement f
or the purported fund investment 
that 
contain
ed several 
obvious 
errors and misspellings
.  This phony account statement
 caused
 the customer 
to 
have concerns about
 the legitimacy of the investment
, and 
 to 
contact
 Broker
-Dealer A and the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) 
to 
express
 his concerns
.     27. After 
Broker
-Dealer A 
and FINRA were notified about Maccoll™s likely 
fraud, they requested to interview 
him
.   However, Maccoll failed to appear and on or about 
March 10, 2018, 
Broker
-Dealer A
 received an 11
-page letter from Maccoll addressed to 
ﬁRegulators and FINRAﬂ in which Maccoll confessed to misappropriating funds from his 
customers.  
Broker
-Dealer A 
terminated Maccoll shortly thereafter.

 Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.10    Page 10 of 10"
65,65,"On August 6, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Salvadore D. Palermo, a trader formerly employed by J.P. Turner & Company, L.L.C., with entering fictitious sales of market-linked certificates of deposit (MLCDs) in order to avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations for the fixed income products.

According to the complaint, Palermo paid above-market prices to acquire MLCDs from J.P. Turner brokerage customers, and then held the MLCDs in J.P. Turner's inventory. To avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations, Palermo entered dozens of fictitious trades over a seven-month period, beginning in August 2014. Palermo entered the sham sales in order to give the impression that the MLCDs had been sold from J.P. Turner's inventory , knowing the named counterparty never agreed to buy the MLCDs and that each trade would ultimately be cancelled. As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner kept inaccurate trade blotters, showed incorrect asset and revenue account balances, and filed inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports for each month between August 2014 and February 2015.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Palermo aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties and other relief.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Mark Troszak, under the supervision of Peter Diskin in the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by Paul Kim and supervised by Graham Loomis."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIAATLANTA DIVISIONSecurities and ExchangeCommission,Plaintiff,Civil Action No.v.Salvadore D. Palermo,Defendants.COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEFPlaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"" or ""Commission"")files this Complaint and alleges as follows:OVERVIEW1. Defendant Salvadore D. Palermo (""Defendant"" or ""Palermo""), aformer fixed income trader for J.P. Turner, L.L.C. (""J.P. Turner""), anow-defunctbroker-dealer formerly registered with the Commission, knowingly entered a seriesof fictitious sales of certain financial instruments which resulted in J.P. Turner'screating and maintaining inaccurate financial books, records and reports.1Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 1 of 12 2. Specifically, between at least August 2014 and March 2015, Palermoentered certain fictitious sales orders in J.P. Turner's books, records and electronictrading systems despite knowing that the named counterparty/purchaser had neveragreed to buy the instruments and that each sales order would ultimately becancelled with the instruments being returned to J.P. Turner's inventory.3. Palermo created these sham sales to temporarily remove theinstruments from J.P. Turner's inventory in order to appear to comply with J.P.Turner's internal inventory policy, which strictly limited the dollar amount of fixedincome inventory that could be held at month end and at other times intra-month.4. As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner made andmaintained inaccurate trading and financial books and records, and filed with theCommission inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single(""FOCUS"") Reports, which contain certain financial and operational informationfor the firm, for each month between at least August 2014 and February 2015, allof which violated of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(""Exchange Act"") and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder.5. Palermo aided and abetted these violations by J.P. Turner.JURISDICTION AND VENUE2Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 2 of 12 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 21 ofthe Exchange Act, to enjoin Defendant from engaging in the transactions, acts,practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and. transactions, acts,practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object, for civil penaltiesand for other equitable relief.7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act.8. Defendant, directly, and indirectly, made use of the mails, the meansand instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce andthe means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with thetransactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.9. Venue lies in this Court because Defendant Palermo was and is aresident of this District, including during the time period between August 2014 andApri12015, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to theviolations of the Exchange Act occurred within this District.DEFENDANT AND RELEVANT ENTITY10. Defendant Palermo has resided within this District for several years,including between August 2014 and April 2015. Palermo worked for J.P. Turnerfrom February 2003 until his termination in July 2015, spending the last five yearsCase 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 3 of 12 of that time as a fixed income trader. Prior to his employment at J.P. Turner,Palermo worked for several broker-dealers, and he has held Series 7, 24(principal), and 63 licenses since the 1980s.11. J.P. Turner was a Georgia limited liability company with its principalplace of business in Atlanta, Georgia. J.P. Turner was privately owned from 1997until June 2014 when it was acquired by RCS Capital Corporation, whichthereafter filed for bankruptcy in 201.5. J.P. Turner was registered with theCommission as abroker-dealer until Apri14, 2016, when its withdrawal FonnBDW (filed earlier in February 2016) became effective. The firm is no longeroperational.BACKGROUND12. In 2003, Palermo joined J.P. Turner as a registered representative,after being employed for seventeen years in the Atlanta area with several differentbroker-dealers.13. In approximately 2010, after seven years of managing a retail book ofbusiness, Palermo transitioned to J.P. Turner's fixed income desk as a trader. Inthis position Palermo serviced the fixed income product requirements of J.P.Turner's registered representatives and their customers by locating and trading withthird-party buyers and sellers of fixed income products.Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 4 of 12 14. As a fixed income trader, Palermo frequently worked with a certainJ.P. Turner registered representative (""Broker"") who regularly invested clients in afixed income financial instrument called amarket-linked certificate of deposit(""MLCD"") .15. MLCDs are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"") insuredcertificates of deposit that tie their rate of return to the performance of one or moresecurities or market indexes, such as bond indexes, the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. MLCDs can be attractive toinvestors due to the possibility of higher returns than traditional CDs, whileproviding some ""principal protection"" for the original deposit amount via FDICinsurance. However, MLCDs are riskier than traditional CDs due to their longermaturity (generally from five to twenty years), limited secondary market andexposure to market downturns (which may result in little to no investment return atmaturity).16. Palermo would routinely buy and sell MLCDs and other fixed incomeproducts on the behalf of Broker and other registered representatives at J.P. Turner.Palermo would utilize J.P. Turner's fixed income desk trading accounts totemporarily maintain positions in these products. However, because the fixedincome desk did not conduct proprietary trading (i.e. trading for its own profit),5Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 5 of 12 and to avoid market risk due to long term positions in fixed income financialproducts, J.P. Turner internal policy placed strict limits on how much inventoryPalermo and the fixed income desk could hold in its accounts without authorizationby management. During 2014 and 2015, J.P. Turner required that the fixedincome inventory accounts be at zero at each month-end and not exceedapproximately $2 to $4 million at any point during each month (again, subject toauthorization by management) .PALERMO PURCHASES AND HOLDSMLCDs IN J.P. TURNER'S INVENTORY17. Beginning in approximately 2013, and continuing into 2014 and 2015,several of Broker's customers sought to sell certain MLCDs held in their accountsprior to maturity. However, the prevailing market price of the instruments wasoften significantly below par amount, which would result in a loss to thesecustomers upon sale.18. To avoid such losses, Broker reached out to Palermo for assistance.Frequently, Palermo would agree to repurchase the MLCD at par value and holdthem in J.P. Turner's fixed income inventory account. Then, Palermo would seekto sell the MLCDs from the fixed income inventory to a third party at a price at ornear par to avoid losses in the fixed income account.DCase 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 6 of 12 19. Although Palermo was occasionally able to sell the MLCDs at or nearpar value, locating a purchaser and completing a trade often took time and requiredPalermo to maintain multi-million dollar MLCD positions in the J.P. Turner fixedinventory account for weeks and in some cases months.PALERMO ENTERED FICTITIOUS SALES TO TEMPORARILYREMOVE MLCDs FROM J.P. TURNER'S INVENTORY ACCOUNT20. Beginning in approximately August 2014, this time delay requiredPalermo to hold MLCD positions for longer periods of time (sometimes as long asseveral months), substantially increasing J.P. Turner's fixed income inventoryposition.21. In order to comply with J.P. Turner's limits on fixed incomeinventory, while avoiding a loss due to market sales of the MLCD positions, foreach month-end from August 2014 through March 2015, and on several occasionsintra-month during that same period, Palermo entered fictitious sales of MLCDsfrom the firm's inventory.22. For each of these fictitious sales, Palermo named a large third-partybroker-dealer as counterparty (without their knowledge) (""Purchaser""), and set thepurchase price at par value (to avoid recording a loss). By entering these trades,Palermo was able to fraudulently remove the oversized MLCD inventory tocomply with J.P. Turner's inventory restrictions, while avoiding selling the7Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 7 of 12 inventory at a loss. Although the removal of the inventory was temporary, as thefictitious sales would ultimately be rejected by Purchaser and taken back into J.P.Turner's fixed income inventory, this process would take a few days' time. Thisdelay allowed Palermo to comply with the strict month-end inventory limitations(which did not allow any inventory to be held) and recover the inventory intra-month when J.P. Turner's policy allowed for several million dollars' worth ofinventory holdings.23. By way of example, on Friday, February 27, 2015 at 4:10 p.m. the lastbusiness day of the month, Palermo entered the following four sales of MLCDswith Purchaser as the purported counterparty:Ł $1,334,000 of Citibank MLCDs at 100 (par);Ł $380,000 of United Community Bank MLCDs at 100 (par);Ł $1,105,000 of Citibank MLCDs at 100 (par); andŁ $620,000 of United Community Bank MLCDs at 100 (par).24. By entering these four sales, Palermo removed $3.44 million ofinventory from the J.P. Turner's fixed income inventory at month end.25. In early March 2015, following J.P. Turner's clearing firm advisingthat the trades had not been ""recognized"" or accepted by Purchaser, Palermo~'3Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 8 of 12 cancelled the trades, with the $3.44 million of MLCD inventory returned to the J.P.Turner fixed income inventory.26. In some cases Palermo issued fictitious sales for the same instrumentnumerous times, while effectively holding the instrument for several months.27. In total, Palermo entered 48 fictitious sales totaling over $24 millionbetween August 2014 and March 2015.28. Palermo's fictitious sales resulted in errors to J.P.

66,66,"On August 3, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Florida residents in a securities offering fraud targeting immigrant investors.

According to the SEC's complaint, over a period of more than two years, Joseph J. Walsh and Robert V. Matthews defrauded dozens of foreign investors participating in the EB-5 program administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which provides foreign nationals with an opportunity to qualify for permanent U.S. residency by investing in domestic, job-creating projects. According to the SEC's complaint, Walsh raised close to $44 million from foreign investors which, through a loan, was to be used to acquire, develop, and operate a Palm Beach hotel controlled by Matthews. The complaint alleges that Walsh misappropriated more than $13 million of the investor funds and that Matthews misappropriated approximately $8 million, some of which he used to acquire a 151-foot yacht and to purchase his former Connecticut home out of foreclosure. According to the SEC's complaint, Walsh and two companies he controlled - Palm House Hotel LLLP (PHH) and South Atlantic Regional Center, LLC (SARC) - also misled investors about the use of an escrow account that purportedly held investor funds prior to disbursement to the hotel, and about Walsh's and Matthews' backgrounds.

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida, charges Walsh, PHH, and SARC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties. The SEC's complaint also charges Matthews with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and with aiding and abetting PHH, SARC, and Walsh's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. In addition, the SEC's complaint also charges as relief defendants 160 Royal Palm, LLC and United States Regional Economic Development Authority LLC d/b/a EB5 Petition for the sole purpose of recovering investor funds they received from Walsh and his entities or Matthews.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Shelly-Ann A. Springer-Charles, Timothy J. Galdencio, and Crystal C. Ivory and was supervised by Eric R. Busto. The SEC's litigation will be led by Alejandro Soto. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDACASE NO.:SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,Plaintiff,V.PALM HOUSE HOTEL LLLP,SOUTH ATLANTIC REGIONAL CENTER, LLC,JOSEPH J.

From November 2012 to March 2015, PHH offered and sold at least $43,991,458in PHH securities to at least 88 foreign investors through the EB-5 Program. The offeringmaterials provided to investors represented that PHH would loan investor funds to Palm HouseLLC (""Palm House"") to acquire, develop, and operate the Palm House Hotel (""Hotel"") located inPalm Beach, Florida. Instead, Walsh and Matthews misappropriated a significant portion of theinvestor funds. Walsh, PHH, and SARC also made false and materially misleading statementsregarding: (1) the use of investor funds; (2) the use of an escrow account to hold investor fundsprior to disbursement to Palm House; (3) the existence of conditions precedent to theadvancement of loan disbursements to Palm House; (4) the guaranteed return of investors' fundsif their 1-526 petitions (Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur) were denied; (5) Walsh andMatthews' backgrounds; (6) the preparation and periodic disclosure to investors of PHHfinancial reports; (7) Palm House's repayment of the loan in monthly installments; and (8) PalmHouse's purported ownership of and investment in the Hotel prior to the commencement of thePHH offering. Matthews participated in the scheme and, with the exception ofmisrepresentations (2), (4) and (6) above, aided and abetted Walsh and his entities in makingthese material misrepresentations and omissions. To date, the Hotel has not been completed andis subject to a foreclosure suit and receivership.4.

In August 2006, Matthews purchased the Hotel through his ownership of anentity. In 2009, that entity lost the Hotel via foreclosure and Developer acquired it through hisownership of 100% of the membership interest in 160 Royal.

PHH's EB-5 Securities Offering19. From November 2012 until March 2015, PHH raised at least $43,991,458 ininvestor funds from at least 88 foreign investors through an EB-5 offering of PHH limitedpartnership interests. The offering materials provided to investors represented that PHH wouldloan investor funds to Palm House to acquire, develop, and operate the Hotel.20. Walsh, PHH, and SARC disseminated at least three versions of PHH's EB-5offering documents and marketing materials (collectively, ""offering materials"") to investors overthe years. Each version included a private placement memorandum (""PPM""), to which abusiness plan, loan documents between PHH and Palm House (""loan documents""), a subscriptionagreement, a limited partnership agreement, and an escrow agreement were attached. PHH-6-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 6 of 18 combined these materials into a multi-hundred page investment portfolio. The investmentportfolio also contained an ""EB-5 Investor Documents & Process Guide,"" a fee agreement, and aUSREDA/SARC Service Agreement. To streamline and expedite the closing of an investment,PHH provided a booklet which contained only the signature pages of the documents necessaryfor investors to make their investments and file their 1-526 petitions with the USCIS.21. PHH's offering materials also included various versions of a project brochure thatwas translated into Chinese and Farsi (""brochures"") and a document titled ""EB5 Petition"" thatexplained the EB-5 process. PHH's offering materials appeared under some combination ofPHH, Palm House, SARC, and USREDA's names, and the Hotel and SARC's logos.22. PHH, through Walsh and others, solicited investors through sales agents. PHHprovided the sales agents with an email that included links to its investment portfolio, thebrochure, and the ""EB5 Petition"" document. Each investor or the sales agent for the investorreceived a copy of the relevant offering documents prior to investing.23. Walsh and USREDA's in-house counsel each participated in creating PHH'soffering materials. The in-house counsel drafted PHH's PPMs, business plans, loan documentsand subscription, limited partnership, and escrow agreements with information provided byWalsh and Matthews. Walsh reviewed and approved all of these documents. Walsh also signedsome of these documents, including the ""EB5 Investor Documents & Process Guide"" aspresident and managing partner of SARC and USREDA, the fee agreement as president ofSARC, and at least one version of the USREDA/SARC Service Agreement on behalf ofUSREDA. Further, Walsh edited, reviewed, and approved various versions of the brochure and""EB5 Petition,"" and signed a letter included in the EB5 Petition as ""C.E.O./President USREDA,Inc.""-7-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 7 of 18 24. Matthews directly and indirectly provided information to Walsh and the in-housecounsel that was included in PHH's PPMs and business plans, and received and reviewed draftsof other documents included in the offering materials provided to investors, including thebrochure.25. As the control person of Palm House, Matthews directed R.B. to sign one versionof the loan documents as managing member of Palm House because Matthews did not want tosign them himself.26. Matthews also met with sales agents, investors, and prospective investors multipletimes regarding the Hotel project.C. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions to PHH Investors1. MisaDnropriation of Investor Funds bv Walsh. PHH. SARC. andMatthews27. Between November 2012 and at least December 2014, the offering materialsmisrepresented that investor funds would be loaned to Palm House to acquire, develop andoperate the Hotel. In reality, PHH, SARC, and Walsh misappropriated approximately$ 13,578,000 of investor funds. First, Walsh kept at least $8,078,000 of investor funds earmarkedfor the Hotel project. Walsh co-mingled these funds with other funds he controlled for his ownuse and to pay expenses unrelated to the Hotel project. Second, in December 2013, Walshloaned Matthews at least $5.5 million of investor funds to save Matthews' personal Palm Beach,Florida mansion from foreclosure. The loan, which was undocumented, was never disclosed toinvestors. In March 2014, Matthews sent Walsh an email expressing his ""gratitude"" for Walsh""saving [his] house.""28. Between approximately June 2014 and December 2014, Matthewsmisappropriated at least $3.4 million of investor funds to obtain title for and pay expenses-8-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 8 of 18 associated with a 151-foot yacht and a piece of property located next to the Hotel. Both weretitled in the names of entities owned and controlled by a member of Matthews' family.Matthews' use of investor funds in this manner was neither permitted by the olTering materialsnor disclosed to investors.29. Between February 2014 and June 2014, Matthews also directed the transfer ofapproximately $4.5 million of investor funds that, through a series of transactions, were used topurchase his former home in Connecticut out of foreclosure and for other related expenses.Matthews then extracted $1.2 million from the Connecticut home through a business purposeloan secured by the property, from which he and his family received $825,000.2. Misrenrcsentations Regarding Escrow RcQuiremcnts and the Returnof Investor Funds30. Between November 2012 and at least June 2014, PHH's offering materialscontained material misrepresentations regarding PHH's use of an escrow account for investorfunds. PHH falsely and fraudulently claimed that investor funds would be held in an escrowaccount at PNC Bank, pursuant to an escrow agreement between PHH, SARC, and PNC Bank,through at least the filing of the investor's 1-526 petition. Contrary to these representations, noescrow account even existed for investor funds. Prior to the PHH offering, the former CFO forSARC and USREDA informed Walsh that the account receiving investor funds would not evenbe administered by PNC Bank.31. PHH's offering materials also contained material misrepresentations regarding thereturn of funds paid by investors. PFIH's PPMs falsely and fraudulently stated that if aninvestor's 1-526 petition were denied by the USCIS for reasons ""within the control"" of PHH, theinvestor's funds would be returned without deduction. The offering materials and SARC's ownwebsite also falsely, fraudulently, and repeatedly stated that investors' funds would be returned if-9-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 9 of 18 their 1-526 petitions were denied generally or without ""cure."" For example, the brochures slatedthat ""[USREDA] and South Atlantic Regional Center offers a 100% Full Refund of all fees andinvestment if your 1-526 is not approved."" Some of these documents and SARC's websitefalsely and fraudulently referred to the promise of a return of the funds as a money back""guarantee.""32. PHH, SARC, and Walsh knew or recklessly disregarded that USREDA andSARC would not be able to repay investors whose petitions were denied because theymisappropriated for their own use millions of dollars of investor funds, and never escrowedinvestor funds prior to their release to Palm House. To date, the USCIS has denied all of theinvestor 1-526 petitions except one, for which it has issued a Notice of Intent to Deny. TheUSCIS denied the 1-526 petitions because, among other reasons, investors failed to demonstratethat the Hotel project would create sufficient jobs given the uncertainty of the project's future.PHH never returned any money to investors.3. Misrcnrcscntations and Omissions Regarding Walsh and Matthews*Backgrounds33. PHH's PPMs and business plans contained misrepresentations and omissionsregarding the backgrounds of Walsh and Matthews, who are both described in a section on""Management."" The description of Walsh's background, which he drafted, stated that he ""hasextensive experience in merger and acquisition strategy and law"" and experience with ""theintricacies of U.S. Securities and Exchange laws."" Walsh did not have any such merger andacquisition or securities law experience.34. Matthews was described as the chairman of Matthews Ventures Holdings, LLC(""MVH""), a diversified holding company with interests in, among other things, real estate,hotels, and construction. However, PHH's PPMs and business plans materially omitted that in-10-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 10 of 18 2009, one of Matthews' companies, PB Realty Holdings LLC, was placed into involuntarybankruptcy with subcontractors obtaining approximately $2 million in judgments againstMatthews, and that Matthews had lost to foreclosure both his own home, as well as the veryHotel in which investors were purportedly investing. Matthews provided his biography to the in-house counsel for inclusion in the PPMs.35. The offering materials also included a section on G. Matthews but did not disclosethat he was a nominee for Matthews in the ownership of the Hotel because of Matthews'financial problems, a material omission. Walsh knew G. Matthews was a nominee for Matthewsbecause of Matthews' financial problems.4. Other Misrepresentations to PHH investors36. PHH's offering materials also materially misrepresented the conditions underwhich investor funds would be loaned to Palm House. In particular, the PPMs stated, ""it shall bea condition of each advance that as of such time there shall not have been a material adversechange in the operations, assets or financial condition of the [bjorrower and its subsidiaries,taken as a whole."" The loan documents made similar representations and stated that thedetermination as to material adverse changes would be made by PHH. Walsh and PHHŠwhichloaned at least $30,413,462 of investor funds to Palm HouseŠnever ascertained whether PalmHouse met these pre-conditions for any loan advance.37. Matthews' misappropriation of approximately $7.9 million dollars of investorfunds represented material and adverse changes in the operations, assets, and financial conditionof Palm House, 160 Royal, and the Hotel, all of which he controlled. Despite being granted theauthority by the loan documents to access Palm House's financial statements and the right toinspect its books and records, PHH never exercised this authority.-II-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 11 of 18 38. The offering materials also materially misrepresented that PHH would provideaudited financial statements or other financial information to investors on an annual or quarterlybasis. PHH never prepared audited financial statements and did not provide audited statements,or any other fmancial reports, to investors.39. The offering materials also misrepresented that Palm House would make monthlyinterest payments to PHH on its loan for five years. Palm House did not make any monthlyinterest payments to PHH.40. In order to bolster investor confidence in PHH's securities offering, PHH'sbusiness plans and brochures also made materially misleading statements suggesting that PalmHouse had substantial funds at stake in the Hotel, and that investor funds were only part of analready well-financed development project. Based on information provided in part by Matthews,PHH's business plans falsely and fraudulently represented that Palm House had $22 million inequity in the Hotel, and the brochures fraudulently stated the project was ""very safe"" based inpart on a substantial equity investment from Palm House. In reality. Palm House acquired theHotel on August 30, 2013 through a $27,468,750 mortgage on the Hotel, with no pre-existingequity in the Hotel.D. Relief Defendants41. Matthews controlled 160 Royal and its bank accounts through his control of PalmHouse. During the course of the fraudulent scheme, PHH, Walsh, and SARC advanced millionsof dollars of investor funds to 160 Royal. During this same time period, Matthews divertedmillions of dollars of investor funds from 160 Royal to other accounts he controlled.42. Walsh controlled and was the manager of USREDA, which handled businessactivities and USCIS petition work for PHH and other SARC-associated offerings. USREDA-12-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 12 of 18 received millions of dollars of investor funds which were fraudulently obtained by Walsh and hisentities.VI.

67,67,"A former Senior Vice President at Sequenom, Inc. (""Sequenom"") has agreed to settle charges that he engaged in insider trading after tipping his friend about Laboratory Corporation of America Holding's (""LabCorp"") bid to acquire Sequenom in a July 2016 tender offer.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Robert Lozuk, who was formerly Sequenom's Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations, tipped his friend (""Individual A"") about the pending acquisition during a social event they both attended a week before the public announcement. According to the complaint, Lozuk was not only subject to Sequenom's written policy and to certain obligations as an officer of the company, but he had also signed a confidentiality letter acknowledging his obligation not to disclose to anyone the company's plans. Nevertheless, Lozuk tipped Individual A, and over the next two trading days Individual A purchased a total of 18,000 Sequenom shares. On the date of the public announcement, Sequenom's stock price increased 176%, allowing Individual A to sell his shares that same day for a profit of over $26,000.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lozuk agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and to a five-year bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. Lozuk will pay a penalty of $26,643. Individual A, who provided timely and valuable assistance to the SEC's investigation, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement wherein he agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $26,643, and among other things, agreed not to violate the federal securities laws for the deferred period of two years.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Adrienne Gurley and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","   1   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28    ADRIENNE D. GURLEY

 2. On July 21, 2016, less than a week before the merger announcement, 
Lozuk
 knowingly tipped

Individual A 
purchased $18,000 worth of 
Sequenom stock
 between July 22 and 25, 2016

 is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Diego, 
California.  Sequenom is a life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic 
testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  Sequenom was 
acqui
red in a 2016 tender offer by LabCorp, and is now a wholly
-owned subsidiary of

, is a Delaware 
corporation headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina.  The common stock of

 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
 13. Sequenom is a life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic 
testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  On June 8, 2016, 
Sequenom™s
 board of directors instructed a large investment bank to contact LabCorp 
and a few other companies to assess their interest in acquiring Sequenom, which was 
Case 3:18-cv-01765-LAB-BGS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 7   4   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28    subject to a large amount of outstanding debt.  Sequenom engaged in due diligence and
 entered into
 negotiations with LabCorp, and on July 20, 2016, representatives of 
Sequenom and LabCorp agreed upon an acquisition price of $2.40 per share.  
 14. At the time of the acquisition, 
Lozuk was the Senior Vice President of 
Commercial Operations at Sequenom, and a
 direct report to the CEO.  In
 addition to the 
duties imposed on Lozuk as an officer and director of Sequenom, 
Lozuk was also subject 
to Sequenom™s written policy, applicable to all Sequenom employees, preventing insider 
trading and its code of conduct.  F
urther, 
Lozuk
 had
 signed a 
confidentiality 
letter 
in 
October
 2015 acknowledging
 his obligation 
not to disclose
 to
 anyone, including certain 
other co
-workers,
 material nonpublic
 information
 regarding Sequenom™s efforts to 
address
 the company™s 
outstanding 
debt
 obligations.
   Ultimately
, the 
board of directors 
decided to 
seek an outside buyer.  
 By at least J
une 8, 2016, Lozuk became aware 
of the 
potential 
for an outside company to acquire 
Sequenom.
 15.   On July 21, 2016, Lozuk attended a 
concert
 with 
Individual
 A.  Having 
signed the 
October 2015 
confidentiality letter, Lozuk knew that he owed a duty to 
Sequenom not to provide 
any 
material nonpublic information regarding the contemplated 
LabCorp
-Sequenom deal to Individual A.  Nevertheless, while at th
e concert
, Lozuk told 
Individual A that LabCorp was about to purchase Sequenom
.   At the time of the tip, 
Sequenom™s
 shares were trading close to $1.
  Individual A knew that Lozuk was 
providing this material nonpublic information in breach of a duty Lozuk owed to 
Seq
uenom. 
  16. On July 27, 2016, the companies announced that LabCorp, through its 
wholly owned subsidiary Savoy Acquisition Corp., would acquire all of the outstanding 
shares of Sequenom in a cash tender offer for $2.40 per share, or $371 million including 
Sequ
enom™s net indebtedness.  After the announcement of the merger, Sequenom™s stock 
price increased 176% to $2.35 per share.  The total daily trading volume increased from 
363,087 on the day before the announcement to 40,718,435 on the day of the

68,68,"A scientist at Laboratory Corporation of America Holding (""LabCorp"") has agreed to settle charges that he engaged in insider trading after learning that his company was about to acquire Sequenom, Inc. (""Sequenom"") in a July 2016 tender offer.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Anup Madan, a principal scientist with LabCorp's Covance Genomics Laboratory, learned of the pending acquisition when he conducted a due diligence related site visit to Sequenom's San Diego facilities. Over the next two trading days, Madan purchased 9,300 shares of Sequenom stock despite having signed a company insider trading policy that prohibited trading based upon confidential information that he acquired in the course of performing his job duties. On the date of the public announcement, Sequenom's stock price increased 176%, allowing Madan to sell his shares that same day for a profit of over $14,000.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Madan agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Madan will disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a penalty of $14,023, which is equal to the disgorgement amount.

ing
 that someone visit Sequenom™s San Diego facilities to perform a confidential due

n   Case 2:18-cv-01121   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 7 of 7"
69,69,"On July 31, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged David A. Harbour of Scottsdale, Arizona with making misrepresentations to investors and misappropriating over $1.5 million in investor funds to finance his personal lifestyle and pay off his debts.

According to the SEC's complaint, between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour raised money from four friends and business acquaintances by representing to them that their funds would be used to finance various businesses, including an American Indian business entity engaged in high-interest installment lending to consumers. The SEC alleges that Harbour told the investors he would use their money exclusively for revenue-generating businesses, and promised them high annual returns, ranging from 12% to 20%. Instead, the SEC alleges, Harbour diverted substantial portions of the invested funds for personal purposes that included paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal credit card expenses, such as expenses for private jets, cruises, stays at resorts, and a payment to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Harbour also allegedly used the investor money to make payments on personal loans and debts he owed to investors in prior business ventures. Harbour ultimately misappropriated $1,535,000 of the money raised from the four investors.

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the District of Arizona, charges Harbour with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

  Case No. 
  COMPLAINT 
   
 Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges: JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
1. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 
20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1) & 77v(a), and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e) and 27(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExch

28transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this complaint.  3. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Se
ction 27(a) of the Exchange 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a) because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district.  In addition, venue is proper in this district because Defendant David Harbour resides in this district.   SUMMARY 4. This matter is based on misrepresenta
tions by Defendant David A. Harbour 
(ﬁHarbourﬂ) concerning the use of investor
 funds in connection with his fundraising 
activities.  Between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour, through various entities he managed and controlled, raised money from 
his friends and business acquaintances by representing to them that their funds woul
d be used to financ
e various businesses, 
including an American Indian business entity engaged in high-interest installment lending to consumers.  Instead of directing the mone
y to revenue-generating 
businesses that could 
achieve the high returns he promised, Harbou
r used substantial porti
ons of the invested 
funds to finance his personal lifestyle and pay off his personal debts.  Harbour ultimately used $1,535,000 of the $2,450,000 that he ra
ised from four investors to pay his personal 
expenses and pay off his debts. 
5. By engaging in this conduct, Harb
our violated Section 10(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) and Rule 10b-5(b) promulgated thereunder and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ). THE DEFENDANT 6. Defendant David A. Harbour is a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona.  
Harbour previously held FINRA 
Series 7 and 63 qualifications and was last associated with a broker-dealer in January 2008.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 
A. Harbour™s Relevant Business Activities 1. Tribal Lending Entity A 
12. In 2014, Harbour, who had long been involved in the ﬁpayday loanﬂ industry, began working with others to develop Tribal Lending Entity A.    13. In August 2014, Harbour, on behalf of his company, Oak Tree, entered into

28a loan agreement with Tribal Lending Entity A.  The agreement specified that Oak Tree would extend up to $10 million in credit to Tribal Lending Entity A at an annual interest rate not to exceed 16% so that Tribal Lending Entity A could ﬁimplement, operate and maintain its online consumer lending businesses currently in development.ﬂ  Harbour 
signed the loan agreement as Oak Tree™s ﬁManager.ﬂ  Between August 2014 and October 2015, Oak Tree provided approximately $2.9 million in capital to Tribal Lending Entity A.   14. From its inception in 2014 until late 2016, Harbour was actively involved in Tribal Lending Entity A™s business.  In late 2016, a third party creditor of Tribal 
Lending Entity A took over the entity™s operations. 2. Other Harbour Ventures 
15. Between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour was engaged in other 
business ventures, including a merchant cash
 advance business, as well as businesses 
associated with the same American Indian tribe that related to healthcare and fire-fighting.  Harbour described some of these 
ventures when seeking to raise money from 
the four investors.   
B. Harbour™s Misrepresentations Regarding Use of Investor Funds 16. Harbour sought to raise money from i
nvestors to finance these enterprises, 
and particularly Tribal Lending Entity A.  Between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour, through four entities he created and controlled, raised money from four individual investors, telling them their investments would be used to finance Tribal Lending Entity A or other revenue-generating businesses, and 
promising substantial re
turns.  Instead of using the invested money as represented, 
Harbour used $1,535,000
 of the $2,450,000 
raised from these four investors to finance his personal lifestyle and pay off his debts. 
1. Investor A 17. In July 2014, Harbour, through Oak Tree, raised $500,000 from a limited 
liability company controlled by Investor A, a resident of Illinois.  Harbour orally represented to Investor A that
 the $500,000 would be used 
solely to finance a consumer

28installment lending operation 
to be run by an American Indian tribal entity.   18. Harbour signed the promissory note fo
r $500,000 that Oak Tree issued to Investor A™s LLC and that included 12% annual interest.   
19. Harbour was a signatory on the Oak Tree bank account to which Investor A 
transferred the $500,000 and had control over 
the money in that account and transfers or 
withdrawals from the account. 20. Contrary to Harbour™s representations, much of the money invested by 
Investor A never went to Tr
ibal Lending Entity A or any 
consumer lending business but 
instead was used by Harbour to pay his persona
l living expenses and de
bts.  For example, days after receiving the $500,000, Harbour wired $35,000 to pay an individual who had loaned him money.  Harbour also spent $144,000 to pay his credit card bills.  The credit 
card charges included tens of thousands of do
llars of Harbour™s personal expenses such as private jets, Disney cruise trips, a visit to Universal Studios, golf tournament tickets, 
and a roughly $2,300 restaurant bill.  Altogether, Harbour used $310,000 of the $500,000 provided by Investor A in ways that were inconsistent with his representations to Investor A.   2. Investor B 21. In December 2014, Harbour, through his Pujanza entity, raised $1 million from Investor B, a resident of California.    Harbour told Investor B that his $1 million investment would be pooled 
with other investor funds to
 finance various businesses 
connected to Harbour, including a consumer 
lending operation and a 
project related to healthcare.  Harbour also promised Investor B that through these investments Investor B 
would achieve a 20% annual return.  Based on these representations from Harbour, Investor B understood that his money would be invest
ed in revenue-generating 
businesses, including a consumer lending oper
ation, that would get him the promised 
high return.   22. Investor B™s investment was structured such that he received a 1% 
membership interest in Pujanza, with Harbour, the ﬁmanaging memberﬂ of Pujanza,

28retaining a 99% membership interest.  The ﬁFirst Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for Pujanza Management, LLC,ﬂ the only written agreement related to Investor B™s investment, indicated that ﬁ[t]
he Company is formed for the purpose of 
making investments in the form of equity i
nvestments or debt investments in various 
industries.ﬂ   23. Investor B played no role in runni
ng Pujanza™s business operations and was 
relying solely on Harbour™s efforts to achieve profits.   
24. As a signatory on the Pujanza bank acc
ount, Harbour exercised control over money in that account including Investor B™s $1 million investment.    25. Contrary to his representations to Investor B, Harb
our used $650,000 of the 
$1 million invested by Investor B to finance his personal lifestyle.  For example, within 
two days of receiving the $1 million from Investor B, Harbour spent $223,000 to pay his credit card bills.  The personal credit card charges related to, among other things, private jets, a Disney cruise vacation, concert tickets, a week-long stay at the Four Seasons Hotel 
in Orlando, Florida, and daily living expenses
 for Harbour and his family.  Harbour also used Investor B™s money to pay over $12,00
0 to a country club and to repay $36,000 to 
an investor from a prior business venture.   
3. Investor C 26. In October 2015, Harbour, through his Oak Tree and Milagro entities, raised $500,000 from Investor C, a resident of 
Texas.  Harbour orally told Investor C that 
the $500,000 investment would be used to finance Tribal Lending Entity A™s lending operations and that the returns on the invest
ment would allow Investor C to recover 
money he had lost in a previous investment
 to which Harbour was connected.  Harbour 
sent Investor C marketing presentations for Tribal Lending Entity A and other information about its business, including an opinion letter from 
a law firm attesting to the legality of Tribal Lending Entity A™s lending operations.   27. Investor C™s investment was structured as a promissory note that also 
included a loan agreement.  The promissory note executed by Oak Tree and Milagro (and

28signed by Harbour) stated next to ﬁUse of Proceedsﬂ that ﬁBORROWER [Oak Tree] shall use proceeds under this Note solely for the 
purpose of lending money to [the American 
Indian tribe that formed Tribal Lending Entity A].ﬂ  The loan agreement similarly stated that the purpose of the loan was for Oak Tree and Milagro ﬁto implement, operate and 
maintain [their] commercial lending business to [Tribal Lending Entity A].ﬂ  The 
promissory note issued by Oak 
Tree and Milagro to Investor C provided for an annual 
return of 15%.  Harbour also personally guaranteed Investor C™s $500,000 investment.   
28. Investor C was relying solely on the efforts of Harbour to achieve a return on his investment and played no role in the 
operations of Oak Tree, Milagro, or Tribal 
Lending Entity A.   29. Harbour was a signatory on the Oak Tree
 bank account to which Investor C 
transferred his $500,000 and had control over 
the money in that account and transfers or 
withdrawals from the account. 30. Contrary to his representations to Investor C, Harbour used $275,000 of 
Investor C™s $500,000 i
nvestment on personal expenses th
at had no connection to Tribal Lending Entity A or any revenue-generating businesses.  Harbour used investor funds to 
pay off substantial personal credit card statements, this time spending about $70,000 of Investor C™s money to pay off a single mo
nthly statement that included charges for 
personal expenses including restaurant meals, 
groceries, clothing, private jets, stays at 
resorts, and significant payments to a univer
sity™s sports program.  Harbour additionally 
sent roughly $90,000 to the account of an entity associated with one of his family members.  He also used the funds to pay for golf clubs, life insurance premiums, car 
payments, and to make a small interest payment to Investor B.   
4. Investor D 31. Between August 2015 and August 2016, Harbour, through the Highpointe 
entity, raised $450,000 from Investor D, a resident of Arizona.  Harbour orally presented Investor D with various business ideas and promised that his 
investment would be pooled 
with other investor proceeds to be put into revenue-generating businesses, including Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 7 of 12  COMPLAINT 8   12

Investor D to reach out to Tribal Lending Entity A™s lawyers to discuss the business.   
32. Highpointe issued six promissory notes
 to Investor D that Harbour signed on behalf of Highpointe.  The promissory notes
 specified an annual 
interest rate of 15% with the potential for an additional 5% per year at Harbour™s discretion.  The notes 
further stated that the money being exchanged constituted a ﬁbusiness loan.ﬂ 33. Investor D was to play no role in a
ny of these businesses and was relying on Harbour™s efforts to achieve a profit so as
 to be able to pay back Investor D.  
34. Harbour was a signatory on the Highpointe bank account to which Investor D transferred his investment funds and had c
ontrol over the money in that account and 
transfers or withdraw
als from the account. 35. Contrary to his representations to 
Investor D, Harbour used at least 
$300,000 of Investor D™s $450,000 investme
nt for personal purposes, including paying 
off personal debts.  Harbour spent over $80,000 of Investor
 D™s funds to pay off credit 
card charges.  These charges included thousands of dollars in purchases at Neiman 
Marcus, over $17,000 in paymen
ts to a residential architecture firm, thousands of dollars 
on expenses related to a golf tournament, and payments to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, as well as meals at restaurants, 
groceries, and purchases from Costco, Target, and Amazon.  Harbour additionally used Investor D™s money to take out a cashier™s check for $101,000 that appears unrelated to any bus
iness activity.  Harbour also used $50,000 to pay an indivi
dual who had invested w
ith him in the past.  36. Harbour™s misrepresentations were material, as the four investors would 
have considered it important to their inve
stment decisions to 
know how Harbour was using their funds, as that could directly impact their ability to receive back their principal investments and achieve the high 
returns that Harbour promised. 37. Harbour acted with scienter.  He knew,
 or was reckless in not knowing, that the representations he made regarding the use 
of investor funds were false or misleading.

used. 
39. During all relevant times, Harbour made use of the means or 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Connection with the Purchase and Sale of Securities Violations of Section 10(b) of th
e Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) (Against Harbour) 40. The SEC realleges and incorporates by 
reference paragraphs 1 through 39 above. 41. Harbour made false and misleading st
atements to the investors.  He represented that their money would be used e
ither to specifically finance Tribal Lending Entity A™s operations or more generally to finance other Harbour business ventures.  Despite these representations, Harbour spent over $1.5 million of the invested funds for personal expenses and to pay off his personal debts.  These misrepresentations 
concerning use of funds were material to the investors. 
42. Harbour acted with scienter.  He knew,
 or was reckless in not knowing, that his statements regarding the use of investor
 funds were false and misleading.  Harbour orally made the statements to the four investors, and he signed on behalf of his entities the agreements and document
s evidencing the terms of the investments.  Harbour 
controlled the bank accounts from which he misa
ppropriated the investor money, as well 
as the various bank accounts between which i
nvestor funds were transferred before he ultimately used them to pay off his personal expenses.  As the person who had made the representations to the investors, Harbour 
undoubtedly knew or was reckless in not 
knowing that the manner in which he used the investor funds was inconsistent with what 
he told the investors.

re made, not misleading.   
44. By engaging in the conduct describe
d above, Harbour violated, and unless 
restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5(b) 
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5(b). 
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
Fraud in the Offer or Sale of Securities Violations of Section 17(a
)(2) of the Securities Act (Against Harbour) 45. The SEC realleges and incorporates by 
reference paragraphs 1 through 39 above. 46. Harbour obtained money by means of 
material misrepresentations to the investors.  As discussed above, based on Harbour™s representations that their money would be used to finance various revenue-generating businesses, the four investors 
invested $2,450,000 in entities for which Harbour was the sole member and manager.  Harbour, who had control over the entities™ bank accounts, then misappropriated $1,535,000 of the investor funds for his pers
onal expenses, thereby obtaining money by 
means of his misrepresentations to investors.   
47. Harbour acted with scienter and was negligent.  Harbour made the 
statements to the investors about how their money would be used and controlled the bank 
accounts from which their funds were misappropriated.  Harbour therefore knew or was 
negligent in not knowing that his use of inve
stor funds was contrary to what he had represented to the investors. 48. By engaging in the conduct described above, Harbour, directly or

 requests that the Court: I. Issue findings of fact and conclusions of

70,70,"On July 27, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Howard M. Appel with manipulating the stocks of three microcap companies while on supervised release following his criminal conviction for a prior securities fraud.

According to the SEC's complaint, Appel orchestrated multiple schemes to manipulate the market for trading in shares of Virtual Piggy Inc., (VPIG), Red Mountain Resources Inc. (RDMP), and Rio Bravo Oil Inc. (RIOB), and concealed his activity by using overseas associates and nominee brokerage accounts.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Appel secretly acquired ownership or control over sufficient shares of the companies so that he and his associates could manipulate their stocks through coordinated trading activity.  As alleged in the complaint, Appel kept tight control over the trading and engaged in matched trading with his associates.  In one instance, Appel allegedly sought to coordinate artificial bidding activity to prevent the price of RDMP from dropping, emailing instructions to his associates:  ""Have ur guy for 12500 at .87 and another 7500 at .85 in case we get hit by selling today. (My guy above that bidding .87).""  In another example in the complaint, Appel sold 200,000 shares of RIOB to accounts controlled by one of his associates overseas in a series of matched trades that accounted for 80 percent of the reported volume on RIOB's second day of trading.

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Pennsylvania, charges Appel with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. Appel has agreed to settle the SEC's charges.  Appel will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The court will determine monetary sanctions and other relief at a later date.

On the same day, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also announced a parallel criminal action against Appel.

The SEC's investigation was conducted in the New York office by Rhonda Jung, Melissa Coppola and Adam Grace under the supervision of Lara Shalov Mehraban.  The litigation will be led by Preethi Krishnamurthy and Ms. Jung.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."," MARC P. BERGER*REGIONAL DIRECTORLara S.

Appel then directed hisassociates to engage in manipulative, coordinated trading to create the appearance of liquidity andactive trading in the stocks. Appel intended for this trading to support and raise the shares' pricesenough to raise capital for the companies and qualify them for listing on a national securitiesexchange.3. During and after his manipulative conduct, Appel obtained over $3 million in profitsby selling his shares in the companies into the public market.VIOLATIONS4.

During the Relevant Period, Virtual Piggy's common stockwas registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(~ [15 U.S.C. ~ 781(g)] andwas quoted on OTC BB and OTC Link under the ticker symbol ""VI'IG.""FACTSA. Overview of the Scheme14. Starting in approximately 2010, Appel became involved with Rio Bravo, RedMountain, and Virtual Piggy (together, the ""Issuers""), ostensibly as a consultant working throughother entities he controlled.15. Appel's involvement with the Issuers enabled him to purchase or obtain significantblocks of the Issuers' stock at little or no cost.16. Appel then recnuted several investors (his ""Associates"") to acquire large blocks ofstock in the Issuers through private placements or other private transactions.17. Appel typically permitted his Associates to purchase the Issuers' shares at a discountthrough private placements of the stock only if the Associates also agreed to buy additional shareson the open market.18. Appel used his role with the Issuers to monitor and control his Associates' tradingactivity, including by obtaining from the Issuers certain Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") data.reflecting purchases and sales of the shares?19. To control the Issuers' stock price and liquidity, Appel insisted that his Associatesobtain his permission before selling their shares in the market and reprimanded Associates who soldwithout his permission.2 DTC is a clearing agency, registered with the Coininission, that provides settlement servicesfor securities trades, among other things.5Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 5 of 15 20. Appel also controlled certain Associates' trading activity by entering orders for theirbrokerage accounts over the phone himself or by accessing their brokerage accounts online.21. Appel, directly or indirectly through his Associates, controlled a significant portionof the Issuers' shares available for trading, or the ""float.""22. To support the market price by creating the appearance of liquidin~ and acti~-etrading in the Issuers' stock and to raise the prices of the Issuers' shares enough to qualify them forlisting on a national exchange, Appel engaged in matched trades and other coordinated tradingactivity between and amongst his own accounts and his Associates' accounts.23. During and after his manipulative activity, Appel sold his shares into the market andobtained profits of over $3 million.B. Red Mountain24. In November 2011, Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through hisAssociates, a significant portion of Red Mountain's float.25. On November 30, 2011, Red Mountain filed a Form 8-K with the Commissiondisclosing that, five days earlier, Red Mountain had issued two convertible promissory notes in theamounts of $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively, to two Swiss companies.26. In fact, the Swiss citizen who controlled both Swiss companies was one of Appel'sAssociates (the ""Swiss Associate"")27. From March 5 through December 31, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased 3,483,000shares of Red Mountain common stock in four accountsŠnone in his nameŠover which he heldpower of attorney.28. Of those 3,483,000 shares, the Swiss Associate purchased approximately 3,336,400shares in pre-arranged matched trades from accounts Appel owned or controlled, directly orindirectly.6Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 6 of 15 29. These matched trades included three purchases on March 7, 8, and 9, 2012, executedat $1.47, $1.46, and $1.50 per share, respectively. On each of those days, the Swiss Associate'stransactions were effected at the low trading price of the day.30. Appel also monitored DTC data to detect Associates selling Red Mountain sharesagainst his directions.31. For example, in June 2013, Appel expressed a concern that certain Associates in hisnetwork were secretly selling stock when they were not supposed to: ""[W]e are getting backdooredout of Europe and I want to see if we can tell where it is coming from.""32. In addition, Appel bought and arranged to have his Associates buy Red Mountainstock on the open market at artificially high prices in order to manipulate the stock priceŠthat is, toincrease the stock price from the natural level established by supply and demand.33. For example, in an email to two Associates on January 23, 2013, Appel wrote:Bot 14500 red mtn [Red Mountain] yesterday and had accumulated9k over the last few weeks. Avg. 865. Have ur guy bid for 12500 at.87 and another 7500 at .85 in case we get hit by selling today. (Myguy above that bidding .87).34. In response, one of Appel's associates expressed concern: ""Howard Š we said nomore above 80c [80 cents] Šwhy are you buying at those levels.""35. On January 22, 2013, Red Mountain shares traded between a low of $0.80 and a highof $0.90 per share. The following day, the stock traded between a low of $0.85 and a high of $0.89per share.C. Rio Bravo36. As with Red Mountain, Appel used manipulative techniques to artificially support orinflate Rio Bravo's stock price by creating a false appearance of supply and demand and of increasedtrading volume.Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 7 of 15 37. In addition, although ostensibly a mere consultant to Rio Bravo, Appel actuallyexercised significant decision-making authority with respect to the company's business operationsand capital-raising activities, such that he functioned as an undisclosed de facto officer of Rio Bravo.38. Among other things, Rio Bxavo's nominal chief executive and chief financial officersregularly consulted with Appel concerning major corporate decisions and at times were required toobtain Appel's approval for such decisions.39. For example, in late 2011, to enable Rio Bravo (under a predecessor name) to file aForm 10-K with the Commission, Appel selected Rio Bravo's auditor.40. In February 2012, Appel supervised the transfer of shares in Rio Bravo's predecessorcompany to entities that he and his Associates controlled.41. On February 20, 2012, R.io Bravo began trading in the open market. That day, onlyone trade occurred in Rio Bravo common stock, for 1,000 shares, setting the market price at $0.85per share. When Rio Bravo's shares began trading, Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectlythrough his Associates, most of Rio Bravo's float.42. From February 21 through 29, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased 1,980,000 sharesof R.io Bravo common stock.43. As Appel and the Swiss Associate had arranged, the Swiss Associate purchasedalmost all of these shares-1,918,195 of the total 1,980,000 shares he bought during that periodŠfrom brokerage accounts Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through an Associate.44. For example, on February 21, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased a total of 200,000Rio Bravo shares in four transactions of 50,000 shares each at a price of $0.755 per share.45. In each of these four transactions, the Swiss Associate purchased the shares from anaccount Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through an Associate.Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 8 of 15 46. The Swiss Associate's purchase of 200,000 shares that day constituted 80% of thereported volume of shares traded that day on the market.47. Similarly, on February 23, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased a total of 282,000shares in four separate transactions at a price of $0.85 per share.48. In each of these four transactions, the Swiss Associate again purchased the sharesfrom an account Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through an Associate.49. The Swiss Associates trades on February 23, 2012 constituted more than 40% of thereported volume of shares traded that day and Appel sold the Swiss Associate the shares at the lowtrading price of the day.50. Similarly, in March 2012, Appel used an account held by an entity that his Associateowned (the ""Associate Entity"") to engage in another series ofpre-arranged matched trades. Appelused the Associate Entity's account to sell and repurchase a large block of stock from a broker-dealer firm (the ""Market-Maker""), which served as a market-maker for Rio Bravo stock and heldaccounts holding Rio Bravo stock beneficially owned by Appel, his Associates, and the associateEntity.51. On March 13, 2012, Appel instructed a registered representative at the Market-Makerto sell 400,000 shares of Rio Bravo at $1.02 per share from the Associate Entity's account. TheMarket-Maker's own account purchased the shares.52. Approximately two minutes after the sale was executed, the Associate Entity'saccount at a Canadian broker-dealer purchased 100,000 shares for $1.03 per share from the Market-Maker.53. 'Those transactions constituted approxirriately 97% of the reported volume of sharesthat day.9Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 9 of 15 54. On nine trading days over the next four weeks, Appel caused the Associate Entity'sCanadian account to purchase an additiona1300,000 shares of Rio Bravo. In each case, the Market-Maker served as the executing broker on the other side of the transaction and sold the remainder ofthe 400,000 shares it had purchased from the Associate Entity.55. On eight of those nine days, the Associate Entity's purchases were executed at thehigh trading price of the day.D. Virtual Piggy56. In appro~xnately 2012, Appel recnuted several Associates to acquire shares ofVirtual Piggy at a discount through private transactions, private placements, and purchases on theopen market.57. Appel exerted control over the Associates' decisions about when to buy and sellshares.58. For example, in January 2013, Appel emailed an Associate: ""[Y]ou cant [sic] sell vpig[Virtual Piggy] in the market.""59. Later, in a July 2013 email, Appel accused the same Associate of selling Virtual Piggystock ""AGAIN when we are trying to get it listed and having to support it every day."" The Associatereplied: ""I bought it to keep it above 3 [dollars].""60. Between the Associates' Virtual Piggy shares and the shares he owned, Appel directlyor indirectly controlled a significant portion of Virtual Piggy's float.61. To help Appel monitor Virtual Piggy's stock sales, he obtained from a Virtual Piggyofficer weekly DTC data that showed any changes in holdings of Virtual Piggy shares at thebrokerage houses.62. When the DTC data showed that an Associate was selling shares prematurelywithout Appel's permissionŠwhich would tend to lower the stock priceŠAppel reacted quickly10Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 10 of 15 and angrily. For example, in a May 28, 2013 email thread, Appel wrote: ""How much [VI'IG] do youshow [an Associate] having left? I would love to catch him red handed.""63. Similarly, on November 25, 2013, Appel wrote to an Associate:You sold the vpig [Virtual Piggy] and rdmp [Red Mountain] whileyour partners were buying and then conveniently forgot to tell usuntil after the fact, or not at all. You've caused incredible turmoil inboth of these deals because you've been backdooring us and thenlying about it!!64. Appel also duped a member of Virtual Piggy's Board of Directors (the ""Director"")into engaging in matched trades of Virtual Piggy stock to manipulate the stock price.65. Specifically, in May 2012, Appel encouraged the Director to ""support"" the companyby purchasing the stock in the open market.66. At Appel's direction, the Director opened an account at abroker-dealer with aregistered representative (the ""Broker Representative"") who serviced a number of accounts ownedor controlled by Appel and his Associates.67. Appel then instructed the Broker Representative to purchase 245,000 Virtual Piggyshares for the Director at a price of $1.01 per share, which was the high trading price of the previoustrading day.68. Appel knew that the majority of Virtual Piggy shares the Director bought would bepurchased from brokerage accounts Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly. Indeed, whenAppel instructed the Broker Representative about the timing of the purchase order, Appel told theBroker Representative that two particular broker-dealersŠwhere Appel controlled accounts holdingVirtual Piggy stockŠwould offer sizeable blocks of the stock.69. On May 2, 2012, the Broker Representative executed the Director's purchase ofVirtual Piggy shares, including the purchase of 190,000 shares at $1.01 per share in four separatetransactions.11Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 11 of 15 70. Each of these four transactions, totaling 190,000 shares, resulted in the Director'spurchase of shares from brokerage accounts Appel owned ox controlled, directly or indirectly.71. As a result of the manipulative activity in Virtual Piggy and the other Issuers, Appelobtained over $3 million in profits by selling his shares into the public market during the RelevantPeriod.FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEFViolations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(x)(3)72.

71,71,"The Securities & Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against John A. Paulsen, a former managing director and fixed income research analyst at a registered broker-dealer, for aiding and abetting a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, from early 2014 until February 2016, Navnoor S. Kang was the Fund's Director of Fixed Income, with investment responsibility for approximately $50 billion of the Fund's assets. According to the SEC's complaint, Kang used his position at the Fund to solicit and receive improper entertainment from Paulsen and Deborah D. Kelley, a registered representative at the broker-dealer. In exchange, Kang directed millions of dollars in state business to the broker-dealer, generating sizable commissions.

The SEC alleges that Paulsen and Kelley planned a ski trip for the purpose of entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. The complaint alleges that Kang told Paulsen and Kelley that the Fund had very strict rules that prohibited him from accepting anything from Paulsen. Yet, according to the complaint, Paulsen and Kelley spent thousands of dollars entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. Paulsen and Kelley then sought reimbursement of those expenses from the broker-dealer, and submited false expense reports which concealed the fact they had entertained Kang on the trip. Later, when the broker-dealer discovered inconsistencies in the expense reports and began an internal investigation, Paulsen and Kelley conspired to lie, and did lie, to the broker-dealer's internal investigators.

The SEC's complaint charges Paulsen with aiding and abetting Kang and Kelley's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction and disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties.

The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Public Finance Abuse Unit members Brian Fagel and Eric Celauro. The SEC's litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Alyssa A. Qualls. The case is being supervised by LeeAnn Gaunt, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Kathryn A. Pyszka, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 COMPLAINT 
 The United States Securities and Exch
ange Commission alleges as follows: 
Nature of the Action  1. This action concerns Defendant John A. Paulsen, a former analyst at a broker-
dealer headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama 
(ﬁBroker-Dealerﬂ), who aided and abetted a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State 
Common Retirement Fund (the ﬁNYSCRFﬂ or the 
ﬁFundﬂ), Deborah D. Kelley, and Navnoor S. Kang. 2. From early 2014 until February 2016, Kang was the Director of Fixed Income and 
Head Portfolio Strategist of the NYSCRF, the third largest public pension fund in the United States, with investment respons
ibility for approximately $50 bill
ion of the Fund™s assets.   3. During the course of Kang™s employment,
 Kang solicited and received improper 
gifts and entertainment from Kelley, a former regi
stered representative at the Broker-Dealer.  In 
exchange, Kang directed public pension trades to
 Kelley at the Broker-Dealer, and Kelley earned sizable commissions.   
4. Paulsen and Kelley were colleagues at the Broker-Dealer.  In February 2015, Paulsen and Kelley planned a ski trip in Park City, Utah for the purpose of entertaining Kang.  Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 1 of 18 2 As part of the trip, Paulsen and Kelley incurred more than $11,000 in expenses entertaining Kang and Kang™s girlfriend.   5. Paulsen and Kelley sought reimbursement
 of those expenses from the Broker-
Dealer, and intentionally
 hid the fact that Kang was on the trip by not including Kang™s name on 
their expense reports.   6. Later, when the Broker-Dealer discovered
 inconsistencies in the reports and 
began an internal investigation, Kelley and Paulsen conspired to lie, and did lie, to the Broker-Dealer™s internal investigators 
about Kang™s presence on the trip. 7. Kang violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by directing Fund business to Kelley in exchange for gifts and entertainment, while failing to disclose his 
receipt of those improper benef
its to the Fund.  Kelley violated the antifraud provisions by providing the undisclosed benefits to Kang as part of the fraudulent quid pro quo scheme with 
Kang.   8. Paulsen knowingly provided substantial assistance to Kelley and Kang by participating in the entertainmen
t of Kang, then hiding his and Kelley™s provision of benefits to Kang by submitting false expense reports, and lying to
 the internal investigators.  Paulsen also 
facilitated Kang™s and Kelley™s 
quid pro quo scheme by allowing it to go undetected by the 
Broker-Dealer and the Fund.  In doing so, Paulsen aided and abetted Kelley™s and Kang™s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Ac
t of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) ], Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ
) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1), (a)(3)].  9. Unless Paulsen is permanently restrained 
and enjoined, he will again engage in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint, and in acts, 
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 2 of 18 3 practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar type and object. 
Jurisdiction and Venue 
 10. The Commission brings this action pursuant
 to the authority 
conferred by Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)]
 and Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)], seeking to restrain and enjoin permanently Defendant from engaging in the 
acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein.  The Commission also seeks 
a final judgment ordering Defendant to pay 
disgorgement, prejudgmen
t interest, and civil penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [at U.S.
C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d)(3) 
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)].  11. This Court has jurisdiction over this action, and venue lies in this District, pursuant to Sections 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 20(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.  §§ 78t(d) and 78aa(a)].  Defendant, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, made use of the mean
s or instruments of transportation 
or communication in, and the means or instrumental
ities of, interstate commerce, or of the mails 
in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein.  Some 
of the acts, practices, transactions, and courses 
of business at issue occurred in the Southern District of New York.   Defendant 12.  John A. Paulsen
, age 57, resides in Park Ridge, New Jersey.  From June 2013 
through March 2015, Paulsen was a Managing Director
 at the Broker-Dealer.  Prior to that, Paulsen worked at a number of registered broker-dealers dating back to 1993.  From April 2015 through the present, Paulsen has been the Head of Research at a registered investment adviser 
based in Wilton, Connecticut.  
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 3 of 18   4 Other Relevant Persons 13. Navnoor S. Kang, age 38, resides in Saratoga Springs, New York.  From January 2014 until his termination in February 2016, Kang was the Director of Fixed Income and Head 

Portfolio Strategist for the NYSCRF, a public pension fund managed by the New York State Comptroller.   
14. Deborah D. Kelley
, age 60, resides in Piedmont, 
California.  From January 2012 
through August 2015, Kelley was a registered representative of the Broker-Dealer and its 
successor, a registered broker-dealer 
based in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Facts 15. Kelley met Kang while he was employed as a portfolio associate with a well-
known asset management firm, and she had a busin
ess relationship with him for a period of time 
while he was working as a vice president and fixed income trader with another prominent asset 
management firm (ﬁAsset Managerﬂ).   
16. Paulsen first met Kang when he worked 
at the Asset Manager, and they had occasional business interactions. 
17. At some point in or around 2012, Ka
ng accepted an $8,000 Rolex watch from a 
registered representative of a broker-dealer, which Kang did not disclose to the Asset Manager. 
18. In late 2012, an internal investigation by the Asset Manager into Kang™s activities concluded that he had accepted Rolling Stones concert tickets valu
ed at $1,200 from a registered 
representative of a broker-dealer doing business with the Asset Manager.     19. In addition, the investigation determined that Kang
 failed to report at least 54 additional instances where he received benef
its and entertainment.  The Asset Manager 
terminated Kang in January 2013 for violations of
 its compliance and ethics policies based on his 
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 4 of 18   5 improper receipt of, and failure to
 report, these benefits and entertainment.  The Asset Manager 
informed Kang that he was being terminated for these reasons. 
20. Between January 2013 and January 2014, Kang was unemployed and actively 
seeking work.  Kelley remained in contact with Ka
ng and assisted him in his job search Œ all in 
an effort to maintain and cultiv
ate their business 
relationship.   Kang™s Employment By And Duties To The NYSCRF
 21. In January 2014, the NYSCRF hired Kang as its Director of Fixed Income and 
Head Portfolio Strategist.  During his job interview with the NYSCRF, Kang lied about the 
reason he was terminated by the Asset Manager. 
 Kelley provided a reference to the NYSCRF on Kang™s behalf. 22. As the Director of Fixed Income at 
the Fund, Kang made investment decisions, 
supervised seven investment officers, and was 
responsible for approximately $50 billion of the 
Fund™s assets that were held in fixed-income securities.   
23. Under New York State Law, the New York State Comptroller, and anyone to 
whom he or she delegates powers of investment
, is a fiduciary of the Fund.  Because Kang was delegated powers of investment by the Comptrol
ler, he was a fiduciary to the Fund.  As a fiduciary, Kang was required to act solely in the 
interests of the members 
and beneficiaries of the Fund, and was prohibited from receiving any consid
eration from any party other than the Office 
of the State Comptroller in connection 
with a transaction involving the Fund. 24. The NYSCRF maintains a ﬁCode of C
onductﬂ containing standards for the management of the Fund.  The Code of Conduct a
pplies to all employees of the Office of the 
State Comptroller who have responsibility for matte
rs relating to the Fund.  Among other things, 
the Code of Conduct mandates that the Fund shal
l ﬁbe managed in accordance with the highest 
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 5 of 18   6 ethical, professional and conflict of interest stan
dards,ﬂ and actions on behalf of the Fund ﬁshall be for the sole benefit of the Retirement System™s members, retirees and beneficiaries.ﬂ 
25. Kang received training on the Fund™s policies and codes, as well as applicable 
New York State Law, and certified as to his understanding of the prohibitions contained therein regarding the receipt of
 gifts, meals, travel, and entertainment. 
26. Kang had an affirmative and continui
ng duty to disclose to the Fund his solicitation and acceptance of
 travel, entertainment, and benefits.  Kang was required to report 
the receipt of anything more than nomina
l value from interested parties.   
27. During his tenure with the Fund, Kang made 
no such disclosures.  Furthermore, 
Kang filed a certification with the Fund in which he represented that he had received no gifts in excess of $1000.  This certification was false. 28. Shortly after Kang joined the Fund, Paulsen and Kang had an in-person meeting.  At the meeting, Kang told Paulsen that the Fund ha
d very strict rules which prohibited him from 
accepting anything from Paulsen.   
Kelley Corruptly Provides Kang With Undisclosed Gifts And Entertainment 29. Kelley provided thousands of dollars™ worth of benefits and entertainment to 
Kang in exchange for access to NYSCRF business, despite the fact that her colleagues had warned her to avoid such behavior.   30. Specifically, in a February 6, 2014 email 
(immediately prior to Kelley beginning 
her coverage of the NYSCRF account), another re
gistered representative
 at the Broker-Dealer 
told Kelley to ﬁremember these guys cannot be
 entertained as they are a state fund.ﬂ   31. Nevertheless, Kelley soon thereafter planned a trip to New Orleans for herself, her 
husband, Kang, and Kang™s girlfriend, wh
ich took place in October 2014.   
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 6 of 18   7 32. On this trip, Kelley spent, and then ex
pensed to the Broker-Dealer, more than 
$8,000 for the four of them on meals, drinks, an
d entertainment, including $6,000 for four VIP 
tickets to a Paul Mc
Cartney concert.   33. Kelley intentionally omitted the names of Kang and his girlfriend from her 
expense reports.  Instead, she falsely reported that clients from a private firm had attended the 
trip.   Paulsen And Kelley Corruptly Provide Kang And  His Girlfriend With Undisclosed Gifts And Entertainment On A Ski Trip 
 34. On November 6, 2014, Kang called Paulsen a
nd raised the idea of a ski trip.  Paulsen mentioned the idea to Kelley, and Kelley 
then planned a ski trip to Park City, Utah, which took place in February 2015. 
35. The ski trip was originally scheduled to begin on Thursday, February 12, 2015, with Paulsen, Kelley, Kelley™s husband, Kang, and Kang™s girlfriend attending.  Kelley and Paulsen learned prior to the trip that Kang and his girlfriend would not arrive in Park City until Friday, February 13.  Paulsen asked Kelley via Bloomberg instant message whether they should 
adjust their arrival date ﬁor ju
st keep it :-).ﬂ  Kelley replied, ﬁI™m still coming in Thurs :-).ﬂ 
36. Between them, Kelley and Paulsen spent and expensed more than $11,000 for 
skiing, hotel rooms, dinners, and drinks.  These 
expenses included the costs of limousine service, 
two lunches, two dinners, ski rentals, ski lessons, and three nights at the Hotel Park City (at more 
than $1,100 per night) for Kang and his girlfriend. Paulsen And Kelley Submit False Expense Reports To The Broker-Dealer 37. After the trip, Paulsen and Kelley discussed how they would handle Kang™s 
attendance on the ski trip when they submitted their expense reports.  Kelley told Paulsen that 

Kang™s name, and Kang™s girlfriend™s name, could 
not appear on their expense reports.  Paulsen Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 7 of 18   8 and Kelley agreed that they would keep Kang™s attendance on the trip a secret.  Paulsen understood Kelley would not mention Kang or his 
girlfriend on her expense reports.  Paulsen planned to do the same thing. 
38. Kelley submitted false expense reports to
 the Broker-Dealer.  On her expense reports, she concealed from the 
Broker-Dealer the fact that Kang 
and his girlfriend were on the 
trip, listing other customers and pe
rsonal acquaintances Œ none of whom were in Park City at the time. 
39. Paulsen also submitted false expense reports.  On February 19, 2015, Paulsen 
requested reimbursement from the Broker-Deale
r for a $363 dinner that occurred on Thursday, 
February 12, 2015, prior to Kang™s arrival in Park City.  On his expense report, Paulsen represented that five people attended the dinner:  Paulsen, Kelley, Kelley™s husband, and two employees of a prominent asset management firm, 
a client of the Broker-Dealer.  In fact, these 
two individuals were not at the dinner, nor were they even in Park City at the time.   
40. Paulsen knew that, at the time he submitted the expense report, the Broker-Dealer 
would not ask questions if he listed client guests on the report.  Paulsen also knew that he needed to justify his and Kelley™s presence in Park Cit
y, because the real reason they were there Œ to 
entertain Kang Œ could not be disclosed. 41. Paulsen also requested reimbursement 
from the Broker-Dealer for a $125 lunch 
that occurred on February 14, 2015.  On his expense report, he represented that the guests were himself, Kelley, Kelley™s husband, 
and an analyst at an investment
 advisory firm.  In truth, the 
analyst was neither at the lunch nor in Park City at the time.  
The actual lunch receipt from the 
restaurant indicated that five 
guests attended the lunch.  The other two guests were Kang and his girlfriend.  Paulsen intentionally omitted Kang™s na
me from his expense report because he knew, 
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 8 of 18   9 and had previously discussed and agreed with Kelley, that Kang could not be mentioned on his 
expense reports. 42. When he submitted his expense report, Paul
sen attached a printout of an email 
exchange he had on February 25, 2015 (after the trip) with the Broker-Dealer™s Head of Fixed Income Sales (and Kelley™s supervisor).  In the 
email exchange, Paulsen asked the Head of Fixed 
Income Sales to confirm, in writing, his preap
proval of Paulsen™s February 2015 client trip (which included the ski trip).  Paulsen listed six customers that he saw during the trip.  The email 
did not mention Kang or the Fund. 
43. On February 26, 2015, Kelley and Paulsen engaged in the following conversation via Bloomberg instant message: 
DK: Lose[sic] lips sink ships! No talky re ski trip si vous plait 
JP: I have not said anything 

DK: Allen says he heard about 
it from you and that we were 
with Nav and ﬁgorgeousﬂ gf JP: I mentioned to Allen yes. sorry 

JP: Told him to stay quiet. He
 was talking about the energy trade you did yesterday DK: ah - xoxo - just need to be SO careful 

JP: I know. 

DK: let™s not mention to anyone
 else - AR, AO, and JW know. 
JP: ok 
JP: I put my expenses in and did not mention them 
. . .  JP: for the [February 12] dinner at Mustang I put down Yuri 
and Del Anderson JP: is that ok? 
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 9 of 18   10 DK: perf 
44. Kang did not disclose his receipt of any of these meals, 
travel, or entertainment to 
the NYSCRF. 
Kang Corruptly Rewards Kelley Wi
th Lucrative Bond Trading Business 45. In exchange for these benefits, Kang steered lucrative NYSCRF bond trading business to the Broker-Dealer, resulting in 
substantial personal gain for Kelley.   
46. When Kang first arrived at the NYSCRF, there were a very small number of 
brokers approved to execute fixed income trades directly for the Fund.   
47. Kang set out to expand the list of approved brokers under the guise of facilitating additional liquidity and obtaining best execution.   48. On June 10, 2014, at Kang™s direction, the Fund initiated a fixed income broker 
search to select brokers for its 
internally managed assets.  Intere
sted entities were required to 
submit applications, which were then revi
ewed internally by a group led by Kang.   49. Kelley submitted an application on 
behalf of the Broker-Dealer.   50. Several months later, on November 6, 2014, the same date Kang called Paulsen to 
suggest the ski trip, Kang sent a memorandum
 to the NYSCRF™s CIO recommending that eight brokers be added to the approved list.  The recommended brokers included the Broker-Dealer, and all eight brokers were approved.   51. Although Kang indicated in his memorandum
 that the eight brokers would be 
required to submit to a ﬁfull due diligence processﬂ conducted by an outside firm, no such 

process ever took place.  Accordingly, the eight brokers were approved based solely on the recommendation contained in Kang™s November 6, 2014 memorandum. 
52. Prior to the Broker-Dealer becoming an
 approved broker, Kang was directing trades to the Broker-Dealer through one of the Fund™s approved brokers (ﬁApproved Broker-Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 10 of 18 Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 11 of 18   12 Paulsen, Kelley, And Kang Continue Their Attempts To Keep The Scheme A Secret
 56. At the end of March 2015, Paulsen left the Broker-Dealer to take a job at an investment adviser firm.  Shortly thereafter, 
the Broker-Dealer™s in-house counsel contacted Paulsen as part of its internal investigation into Kelley™s ente
rtainment of Kang.  Paulsen was 
asked to consent to an interview by the Broker-Deale
r™s outside counsel, and he agreed to do so.   57. Shortly thereafter, Paulsen called Kelley and asked if she knew the purpose of the internal investigation.  Kelley 
said that she believed the Broker-Dealer was looking into the ski trip, and that the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel had also scheduled an interview with her.  Paulsen told Kelley that 
he would delay his interview until after Kelley™s so that they could 
speak again after Kelley™s interview and align their stories. 
58. The Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel interviewed Kelley on April 29, 2015.  During the interview, Kelley repeatedly lied abou
t Kang™s participation in the ski trip and her 
paying for Kang™s expenses.   59. After Kelley™s interview, Kelley told Paul
sen what she had been asked, and what she had said.  Paulsen agreed with Kelley to 
tell the Broker-Dealer™s ou
tside counsel a story consistent with Kelley™s Œ in other words, 
Paulsen agreed to lie during his interview. 60. When the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel asked Paulsen about the February 14, 2015 lunch, Paulsen attempted to line up his account of what happened with what Kelley had told the investigators.  Paulsen said that the i
nvestment analyst that he previously identified was 
not present at the lunch.  Instead, Paulsen claimed (as had Kelley) 
that some of Kelley™s friends joined them when, in fact, Kang a
nd his girlfriend were there.   61. Paulsen told other lies during the interview to attemp
t to corroborate Kelley™s false account.  Paulsen falsely told the Broker-D
ealer™s outside counsel that, while Kang was in 
Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 12 of 18   13 Park City during the weekend of the ski trip, he was there on his own and did not go out with Paulsen and Kelley.  Paulsen also said that Kang was not staying at the same hotel as Kelley, 
when, in fact, Paulsen knew that Kang and Kelley stayed at the same hotel.  Paulsen also said 
that he saw Kang for the first time in Park C
ity on February 15, 2015, when in fact Paulsen, Kelley, and Kelley™s husband had had lunch and dinner with Kang and his girlfriend the previous day.  62. During the interview, Paulsen also said that Kang paid for food and drinks for the group after skiing on February 15, 2015.  While Paul
sen claimed that he did not remember why 
Kang insisted on paying, he posited that maybe 
Kelley had paid for something earlier in the day 
and Kang needed to offset it.  This was the fals
e narrative that Paulsen and Kelley had agreed to tell the investigators.  In fact, Kang did not pay for food and drinks, and the concept of Kang 
attempting to repay Kelley was a fabrication. 
63. Paulsen then said that he had dinner that night with Kelley, Kelley™s husband, and Kelley™s two friends.  This was another part of the false narrative that Paulsen and Kelley 
conspired to tell the investigators.  In fact, Kang and his girlfriend were at that dinner; Kelley™s friends were not.   64. At the end of his interview, Paulsen lied again, saying that he never witnessed Kang being entertained on the ski trip. 65. On August 10, 2015, the Broker-Dealer terminated Kelley and, on February 22, 
2016, the NYSCRF terminated Kang. 
66. On May 30, 2017, based in part on the conduct described in this Complaint, 
Kelley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit se
curities fraud and conspiracy to commit honest 
services wire fraud, each of which Kelley committe
d while she was a registered representative of

74,74,"On July 24, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Matthew Brunstrum, formerly a financial analyst at Stericycle, Inc., with insider trading and with tipping his mother, who was also charged with insider trading.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that in April 2016, Matthew Brunstrum learned through his job that Stericycle's first quarter 2016 financial results would be much worse than had been expected and used this material non-public information to trade in Stericycle securities in advance of the company's upcoming April 28, 2016 earnings announcement. The complaint also alleges that Matthew Brunstrum disclosed Stericycle's earnings information to his mother who traded on that information. Stericycle's stock fell by $26.18 the day after Stericycle announced its first quarter financial results, losing almost 22 percent of its value. The SEC's complaint alleges that as a result of their illegal trading, Matthew Brunstrum avoided losses and earned profits in the amount of $159,904, and Susan Brunstrum avoided losses and earned profits in the amount of $170,252.

The complaint charges Matthew Brunstrum and Susan Brunstrum with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants each agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws and agreed to pay disgorgement equal to each of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. The court will determine the civil penalty amounts. The settlements are subject to court approval.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by Kristopher Heston, Jake Schmidt and Ann Tushaus and was supervised by Amy Cotter, all of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Doressia Hutton and Mr. Heston.

 Case: 1:18-cv-05035 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/24/18 Page 14 of 14 PageID #:14"
75,75,"On July 11, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Wyoming company and its principal for an offering fraud targeting primarily elderly Asian-American and Asian members of an online Christian ministry.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, alleges that, between November 2016 and February 2018, Edward A. Young and his wholly-owned entity, Guardians Trustee, LLC, fraudulently raised money from members of an online ministry by promising returns of 400% through operation of a purported private banking facility, but actually misappropriated investor funds to pay for Young's personal expenses, another individual's child support, and start-up costs for an unrelated entity. The complaint also alleges that Young and Guardians Trustee falsely told investors that their funds were indemnified against loss, and failed to disclose prior orders against Young for securities fraud and criminal theft. The investors lost all of the money they invested.

The SEC's complaint charges Young and Guardians Trustee with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Young and Guardians Trustee have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $170,000 and prejudgment interest of $9,253, and to be enjoined from future securities laws violations. Young has also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than trading in his personal account. The District Court approved the settlement on July 17, 2018.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ty J. Cottrill and supervised by Laura M. Metcalfe and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be handled by Danielle Voorhees."," Mark A. KlaassenUnited States AttorneyNicholas Vassallo (WY Bar #5-2443)Assistant United States AttorneyUnited States Attorney's OfficeP.O.

Young (""Young"") and Guardians Trustee, LLC(""Guardians Trustee"") (collectively, ""Defendants"").Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 1 of 15 I. SUMMARY1. This SEC enforcement action involves a securities fraud directed primarily atAsian-American and Asian Christians, and perpetrated by Young and his wholly-owned entity,Guardians Trustee.2. From approximately November 2016 through February 2018, Defendantspromised potential investors, who were members of an online ministry, 400% retums through theoperation of a supposed ""Private Banking Facility"" (""PBF""). Defendants raised at least$170,000 from ten investors, many of them elderly, for the PBF program using a website(www.PerfectLight.us), in-person information sessions, and other offering materials.3. When soliciting investors. Defendants used complex and confusing language tomisrepresent the operation and safety of the PBF program, as well as their use of investor funds.In fact, the PBF program had little substance and never generated profits. Investors lost all oftheir money.4. Defendants misappropriated investors' funds. They used the bulk of the money topay Young's personal expenses and the child support of another individual, as well as to fund aseparate entity controlled by that individual.5. Defendants also never disclosed to investors Young's criminal and disciplinaryhistory, including past sanctions against him for fraud and theft, despite statements on theGuardians Trustee website touting Young's industry background.6. The interests Defendants offered were investment contracts, which are securities.Defendants also improperly failed to register their securities offering.7. As a result of the conduct described herein. Defendants Young and GuardiansTrustee violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 2 of 15 Specifically, Defendants made materially misleading statements and omissions, and thusviolated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(a)(2) of theSecurities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934 [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)].

Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c)].n. JURISDICTION AND VENUE8. The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)and (e) and 78aa]. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means orinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the means or instruments oftransportation or communication in interstate commerce, in connection with the acts, practices,and courses of business set fordi in this Complaint.9. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 77u(a) and 78aa and 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2). Defendant Young resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Defendant Guardians Trustee isa Wyoming limited liability company with its principal place of business in Cheyenne,Wyoming. In addition, many of the acts and practices described in this Complaint occurred inthe District of Wyoming.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 3 of 15 III. DEFENDANTS10. Edward A. Young, age 73, is a resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is theprincipal and sole operator of Guardians Trustee. Young drafted and disseminated theinformation contained on www.PerfectLight.us, as well as all other written information about thePBF program.11. Guardians Trustee, LLC is a Wyoming limited liability company with itsprincipal place of business in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Young formed Guardians Trustee in 2014,and he is Guardians Trustee's only member and owner. Guardians Trustee operated thewww.PerfectLight.us website (the ""Website"") and disseminated other offering materials for thePBF program.IV. FACTSA. Defendants Offered Securities In the PBF Program.12. Young organized Guardians Trustee in 2014 and began to develop the structure ofthe PBF program in early 2015. Defendants offered investments in the PBF program fi-omapproximately November 2016 through Febmary 2018.13. Defendants offered the PBF program only to members ofPerfectGift.org(""PGO""), an online, for-profit ministry incorporated in Wyoming in 2014. The PGO ministry isprimarily directed toward, Asian-American and Asian Christians.14. To participate in the PBF program. Defendants invited PGO members to placemoney in an irrevocable inter-vivos life insurance trust (""ILIT"") with the investor and GuardiansTrustee serving as co-trustees. The Defendants represented that these funds would then beplaced in the PBF program to generate retums.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 4 of 15 15. The investments Defendants offered were securities in the form of investmentcontracts. The investments involved investments of money from PGO members, in a commonenterprise with others for an investment purpose. Defendants promised investors that theirreturns would be generated from the efforts of Young and others through the PBF program.16. Defendants used a variety of written materials, including the www.Perfectlight.uswebsite, trust creation documents, and ""bond trust indenture operating agreements"" (collectively,the ""Offering Materials"") to describe the PBF program and inform investors about the offering,the safety of investor funds, and promised retums. Young drafted, posted on the Internet,mailed, and emailed the Offering Materials using means of interstate commerce.17. Young exercised ultimate authority over all statements made in the OfferingMaterials, which were issued in the name of Guardians Trustee. Yoimg also knew andunderstood the content of all of the information that the Defendants included in the OfferingMaterials. Young is Guardians Trustee's only principal, and his actions are imputed toGuardians Trustee.18. Defendants published the Website starting in June 2017. Prior to June 2017,Defendants promoted the PBF program through Young's in-person meetings with individuals orsmall groups of prospective investors. During these meetings, Young provided verbaldescriptions of the program and written examples of its alleged wealth-building process. He alsosent written information to prospective investors via email and provided the other OfferingMaterials to at least some potential investors who were interested in the program.19. Defendants raised at least $170,000 from the offering. Defendants directed all ofthese fimds into Guardians Trustee bank accounts controlled by Young. These funds weredeposited via electronic funds transfer systems using means of interstate commerce.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 5 of 15 B. Defendants Made False and Misleading Statements About the PBF Program'sOperation, Safety, and Use of Funds and Failed to Disclose Young's Criminal andDisciplinary Background.20. In the Offering Materials, Defendants represented that the fiinds investors used tocapitalize an ILIT would be ""hypothecated"" (loaned) by Guardians Trustee to the PBF program.The PBF would then engage in bank-like activities to generate income, including making loansto other PBF program participants.21. Also in the Offering Materials, Defendants represented that income from theseactivities would then be available to the investor in the form of a revolving line of credit(""RLOC""), allowing the investor to access 400% of the amount of funds the investor contributedto the trust. Defendants represented that investors would be required to repay their draws fromthe RLOC, but that each payment an investor made would also increase the amount of fundsavailable to the investor by four times the amount of the payment.22. Defendants further represented in the Offering Materials that investors' fundswere safe and would be indemnified against loss through the operation of the ""US LegalReserve."" Defendants described this purported reserve as a Federal Reserve-like entity thatguarantees the payment of life insurance claims.23. Defendants used complex and confusing language to hide the lack of substance totheir investment program. In reality. Defendants did not have the means to use PBF programactivities to generate 400% returns, or to use any insurance reserve fund to secure investormonies that were invested in the PBF program.24. For example, Defendants made the following statements about the operation ofthe PBF program on the Website. The other Offering Materials made similar representations.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 6 of 15 a. ""The PBF has ""developed and utilizes a series of proprietary, highly sophisticatedma±ematical algorithms that match hypothecated capital assets with long termliabilities... held with a separate Equity Depository Trust.""b. ""The core component of the PBF is a unique Credit Facility that has the effect ofplacing capital in motion, initiating a process called Continuous CapitalFormation.""c. ""This mechanism is ""combined with Aggregation of solid, unwavering Collateralsupported by the US Legal Reserve to provide an entirely new class of monetaryassets, called Collateral Based Assets, offered exclusively through PBF CapitalReserve System.""25. On the Website, Defendants also described the returns available to investors asfollows. The other Offering Materials made similar representations.a. ""The PBF Credit Facility drives the PBF mechanism. As new capital (cash) isdeployed. Capital Reserves are established. The Credit Facility is subsequentlyable to provide leverage of these funds equal to 400% of the Capital Reserves. Aminimum of $4,000 (cash) of new initial capital is required to start the PBFContinuous Capital Process.""b. ""Thus, a $4,000 new initial Capital contribution yields a $16,000 Credit Reserve""accessible to the investor in the form of a revolving line of credit.c. ""[A] Credit Asset is equal to four times the cash value of the Capital Asset(cash).""d. ""[C]redit Assets allow consumption of good and services and the building ofcapital wealth, measured in US Dollars, through the surplus of Credit Assets(400%) over and above the more limited cash value (100%).""26. On the Website, Defendants summarized the PBF program as follows. The otherOffering Materials made similar representations.In short, money is being employed by the Co-Tmstee such that capital isconstantly being created and recreated, as he or she elects to engage in the processof Continuous Capital Formation, and ultimately unlimited Disposable CashFlow. As a result, the ILIT continues to grow Assets, and the Assets are under thelegal and financial protection of the Trust at all times, while being indemnifiedagainst loss... through the Collateral Based Assets backed by the US LegalReserve.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 7 of 15 27. In fact, contrary to Defendants' representations in the Offering Materials, the PBFprogram did not engage in any activities to generate income and could not have generated thepromised 400% retums.28. In addition, contrary to Defendants' representations in the Offering Materials,Defendants did not use investor funds for investment purposes. Instead, Defendantsmisappropriated all funds, using the money to pay for Young's personal expenses and travel, forthe back child support obligations of another individual, and for start-up costs for an unrelatedentity controlled by that individual. Defendants did not disclose any of these uses of investorfunds.29. Furthermore, contrary to Defendants' representations in the Offering Materials,the funds investors placed in the program were not safe or guaranteed through any reserve fund.Investors lost all of the money they invested.30. In addition, despite touting on the Guardians Trustee website Young's ""manyyears of experience in the Insurance, Investment, and Commercial Banking Industries[,]""Defendants did not disclose in any of the Offering Materials the prior criminal and regulatorydisciplinary actions against Young - all of which were known to Defendants - which include thefollowing:a. In 2015, Young was convicted in Indiana of felony insurance fraud, forgery andtheft for a scheme in which he unlawfully used another person's identity to sellinsurance products and misappropriate the commissions from those sales. Heserved approximately 30 days in jail as a result of that conviction.b. In 2010, Young was found liable by the Indiana Securities Division of theDepartment of State for securities fraud in connection with the sale ofCase 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 8 of 15 unregistered securities. Young was permanently barred from the securitiesindustry in Indiana, ordered to repay investors over $186,000 and assessed a$25,000 civil penalty. To date, Young has not paid any of the ordered restitutionor penalty.c. In 2011, Young had his license to sell insurance in Indiana permanently revokedby the Indiana Commissioner of Insurance for engaging in the sale of insuranceand trusts through the use of fraudulent and dishonest business practices.31. Each of these misrepresentations and omissions would be material to thereasonable investor since each of them related to the fundamental nature of the investment: theuse of investors' funds, the means by which Defendants would use investors' funds to generateprofits, the returns investors would receive, the safety of their investments, and prior actionsagainst the person responsible for generating investment returns.32. Defendants each knew or was reckless in not knowing, and was negligent in notknowing, that the misstatements and omissions in the Offering Materials were materially falseand misleading.C. Defendants Engaged in Fraudulent Acts, Practices, Courses of Business, and aScheme to Defraud Investors.33. From at least November 2016 through February 2018, Defendants engaged infraudulent acts, practices, courses of business, and a scheme to defraud investors in the PBFprogram.34. Defendants' fraudulent acts, practices, and courses of business, and acts infurtherance of their fraudulent scheme, included, but were not limited to:a. Drafting and disseminating false and misleading statements about the PBFinvestment program and using complex and confiising language to misleadCase 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 9 of 15 investors about the operation of the program, the returns it would generate, andDefendants' uses of investment funds;b. Misappropriating investors' monies for Young's personal use, as well as to paythe debts of another individual and an entity that individual controlled; andc. Keeping secret the information about Young's criminal and other history of thefland fraud, including securities fraud, which information is necessary to maketruthful statements in the Offering Materials describing Young's industryexperience and professional history, and the disclosure of which might alertinvestors to the possibility for fraud in this offering.35. Defendants' actions in furtherance of the scheme were knowing or reckless andresulted from Defendants' negligence.36. Defendants' fraudulent acts, practices, courses of business, and fraudulent schemewere material to the reasonable investor because Defendants' conduct related to the fundamentalnature of the investment: the use of investors' funds, the means by which Defendants would useinvestors' funds to generate profits, the returns investors would receive, the safety of theirinvestments, and prior actions against the person responsible for generating investment retums.D. Defendants' Offering was Unregistered and not Exempt from Registration.37. From approximately November 2016 through February 2018, Defendants offeredand sold interests in the PBF program, which were investment contracts and therefore securities.38. Defendants offered and sold PBF program investment contracts when noregistration statement was filed or in effect for the transactions. Defendants raised at least$170,000 from ten investors in multiple states in the PBF investment contract offering. Noexemption from registration was available for this offering.10Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 10 of 15 39. Defendants offered and sold PBF program investment contracts to investors usingthe means or instruments of interstate commerce including but not limited to telephones, theInternet, and the mails.40. Defendants offered and sold PBF program investment contracts to somermaccredited investors. Neither of the Defendants had a reasonable basis to believe that all PBFprogram investment contracts investors were accredited.41. Defendant Young cannot rely on any Regulation D exemption under theSecurities Act due to his 2015 felony conviction.V.

76,76,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action on July 19, 2018 in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, charging Cape Cod-area investment adviser Kimberly Pine Kitts with defrauding multiple clients by stealing over three million dollars from their investment and retirement accounts.

According to the Commission's complaint, Kitts engaged in a six-year scheme to steal money from client accounts by forging client signatures on withdrawal requests from variable annuities, forging client signatures to wire funds from client brokerage accounts, and misleading clients into withdrawing funds to make fake tax payments. Kitts continued this practice until 2017 when a client questioned Kitts about the dwindling balance in her account. Through 82 unauthorized withdrawals, Kitts stole more than three million dollars from seven clients, and then tried to conceal her fraud through falsified account statements and other documentation. Kitts used the money she stole for personal expenses, including paying for vacations and several luxury vehicles.

The Commission's complaint alleges that Kitts violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Kitts.

The Commission's case is being handled by Gretchen Lundgren, John McCann, and Michele T. Perillo of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Paul D'Amico, Mark Gera, and Andrew D. Caverly of the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations in the Boston office, who conducted a related examination."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 DEFENDANT
 5. Kitts
, age 5
1, is a resident of Orleans, Massachusetts.  
In April 2004
 she was 
employed by 
the Firm
 as a registered representative 
and investment adviser representati
ve in 
one 
of the Firm™s branch offices in 
Massachusetts
 doing business as (ﬁd/b/aﬂ) 
Marquis Consulting
, LLC (ﬁMarquisﬂ), an entity she created and wholly controlled
. 6. In addition to operating as a d/b/a, 
Marquis purportedly 
offered
 tax and business 
valuation services
, and Kitts 
performed tax work for several of her advisory cl
ients through 
Marquis
.  Kitts represented that she was a Certified Public Accountant, and even told at least two 
of her advisory cli
ents that she held a Ph.D. in economics, neither of which is true
.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
 7. Beginning in 201
1, the 
Defendant
 engaged in at least three separate schemes to 
misappropriate 
the 
assets of 
her clients
 in order to 
pay
 her
 personal expenses.  
She dire
cted these 
client assets to 
two
 bank account
s for Marquis
, although the majority of misappropriated funds 
Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 2 of 8 3  were placed in one account
 (the ﬁMarquis Accountﬂ)
.  In each instance, 
the 
Defendant
 exploited 
her
 fiduciary relationship with an advisory client, 
made intentional misstatements
, and engaged 
in deceptive conduct in order to obscure 
her
 wrongdoing
.    Misappropriation of Clients™ Variable Annuity Funds 
 8. Some of the Defendant™s advisory clients purchased and held a type of financial 
product known as a 
variable annuity.  
A variable annuity is a contract between 
an investor
 and an 
insurance company, under which the 
insurance company
 agrees to make periodic payments to 
the investor
, beginning either immediately or at some future date. 
 From
 July 2011
 throu
gh June 
2013, the 
Defendant
 made unauthorized withdrawals from the variable annuities of 
six
 of her 
advisory 
clients
 (collectively, ﬁthe Annuity Clientsﬂ)
.  The 
Defendant submitted 
withdrawal 
forms to 
two
 insurance companies 
on which she forged her clients
™ signatures 
and 
direct
ed the 
funds to 
two of 
her
 Marquis 
bank a
ccount
s for her personal use
.  In total, 
the Defendant
 made 
24 unauthorized withdrawals of client funds
 totaling 
$962,654.   Misappropriation of Clients™ 
Brokerage Account
 Funds
 9. In June 2013, 
the 
Defendant began stealing money from 
three of 
her clients™ 
brokerage accounts.  
Client 
A is in h
er early
-50s and was a client of 
the Defendant
 for 
seven
 years.  Client
s B and 
C are
 a retired 
couple who were clients of the Defendant for 12 years
.  Clients B
 and 
C were also Annuity Clients from whom the Defendant 
had 
misappropriated 
$481,401.85 in variable annuity funds
. 10. On June 24, 2013, 
the Defendant
 forged 
Client A™s 
signature on an Outgoing 
Federal Fund Wire Request to 
the Firm
 with instruction
s to wire $75,000 from 
Client A™s 
brokerage 
account 
to the Marquis Account ﬁfor further creditﬂ to 
Client A
.  The Defendant 
did 
Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 3 of 8 4  not ﬁcreditﬂ or use these funds for the benefit of Client A
, but instead used them for her own 
personal purposes
.      11. In an app
arent attempt to avoid questions about transferring 
Client A™s 
funds
 to a 
third
-party account, 
i.e.
, the Marquis Account, 
the Defendant
 submitted fake documentation to 
the
 Firm 
showing 
that 
Client A 
was the 
owner 
of 
a New York
-based company, 
Marquis, LLC.  
In fact, 
Marquis, LLC was non
-existent.  
Client A 
neve
r formed any such company nor had any 
knowledge of the Defendant™s representations to the Firm.
 12. After the initial $75,000 transfer
 of Client A™s funds
, the Defendant submitted 
several add
itional wire requests forged with Client A™s signature.  
By November 2013, 
the 
Defendant 
established a standing authorization
 through additional forgeries of Client A™s 
signature
 to allow her to transfer money from 
Client A™s
 account to 
the
 Marquis Account
 without 
a written request
.  The Defendant transferred a total of $355,636.87 from Client A™s 
brokerage 
account to her Marquis Account in 2013.
  The steady conversion of funds occurred over the next 
four years in the following amounts: $763,000 in 2014; $3
57,250 in 2015; $530,000 in 2016; and 
$9,000 in 2017.  In total, from 2013 to 2017 
the Defendant
 made 56 unauthorized withdrawals
, misappropriat
ing $2,014,887
 from 
Client A
™s 
brokerage 
account.
 13. After Client A™s funds were nearly depleted 
from Client A™s brokerage account by 
early 2017, the Defendant returned to stealing funds from Clients B and C.  In 
May 2017, 
the 
Defendant
 forged a 
written 
request 
for 
a $125,000 check from 
Clients B
 and 
C™s
 brokerage
 account 
payable 
to Marquis
 LLC.  The 
Defendant deposited this check in
to her Marquis 
Account.
  Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 4 of 8 5   Misleading her Client to Withdraw Money from her Retirement Account
 14. In June 2017, 
the Defendant
 advised 
Client B
 that she should move $200,000 
from her 
individual retirement account (
ﬁIRA
ﬂ) to 
the 
managed cash account 
she shared with 
Client C 
to pay some taxes.  
The Defendant tricked Client B into signing signature pages for IRA 
distributions, while concealing the directions for delivery of funds.  
Unbeknownst to 
Client
s B and C
, the Defendant
 directed the $200,000 distribution to her Marquis Account.  
  The Defendant™s Cover
-Up 15. In August 2017, 
Client A
 asked 
the Defendant
 for all of her account statements, 
not yet suspecting any wrongdoing.  When 
the Defendant
 failed to provide her statements,
 Client 
A™s lawyer contacted 
the Firm
.  In response, 
the Firm
 initiated an investigation.  After seeing the 
large number of wire
 transfer
s from 
Client A™
s brokerage 
account to the Marquis Account, 
the 
Firm
 asked 
the Defendant
 to provide the Marquis Account
 monthly statements.  To hide 
evidence of the unauthorized 
withdrawals
 from Client A™s brokerage account
, the Defendant
 electronically 
altered the
 Marquis Account monthly statements
 to change the source
s and 
amounts 
of the deposits
 into that account
.   16. In addition, 
the Defendant
 told 
the Firm
 that Marquis, LLC was created by 
Client 
A and named after the Defendant™s company because of their close friendship.  
In an attempt to 
bolster this falsehood, the
 Defendant
 created
 fake Schedule C tax forms for Marq
uis, LLC for 
2014-2016 and emailed them to the Firm
.   17. By early November 2017, 
the Firm
 concluded that 
the Defendant
 misappropriated 
funds from 
Client A
™s 
account.  
The Firm
 terminated 
the Defendant
 on November 15, 2017.

77,77,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut investment advisory firm and its chief executive officer with putting $19 million of investor money, including elderly investors' retirement savings and pension plans, in risky investments and secretly pocketing hefty commissions from those investments.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Temenos Advisory, Inc. and George L. Taylor steered advisory clients and other investors, including senior citizens and individuals approaching retirement, into four risky, illiquid private offerings. While Temenos and Taylor charged advisory fees for unbiased financial advice, they allegedly concealed from their clients the high commissions they were pocketing from these risky and unsuitable investment recommendations, including cash and ownership stakes in the private companies they recommended, and fraudulently misled clients about the risks and prospects of the investments. The SEC also alleges that Temenos and Taylor grossly overbilled some of their advisory clients.

The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Connecticut, charges Temenos and Taylor with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.

The case is being handled by Dawn Edick, Marc Jones, Rua Kelly, Patrick Noone, and Amy Gwiazda. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Maria Viana, Kenneth Leung, and Mayeti Gametchu of the Boston office."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁthe Commissionﬂ)alleges 
the following against Defendants Temenos Advisory
, Inc. (ﬁTemenos"")and its principal, George 
L. Taylor (ﬁTaylorﬂ),and hereby demands a jury trial:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.Temenos is a Connecticut-based investme
nt adviser and Taylor is the majority 
owner of Temenos and also holds 
several positions at the firm, including chief executive officer
(ﬁCEOﬂ).  From 2014 through 2017, Temenos and Ta
ylor defrauded their 
advisory clients and 
prospective clients by steering the clients into
 unsuitable investments and by hiding commissions 
and other financial incentives th
at Temenos and Taylor were poc
keting, on top of the advisory 
fees that the clients were paying for supposedly
 unbiased financial advice. Temenos and Taylor 
repeatedly downplayed or concealed risks, and 
overstated potential gains, associated with a 
series of illiquid private placements
 that they advised their clie
nts and prospective clients to 
invest in.  In so doing, Defendants promoted the investments and pocketed commissionsŠa
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 1 of 43 2percentage of each client™s investmentŠfrom the private placement companies, thereby illegally 
acting as unregistered broker-dealers.  
2.Through their conduct, Temenos and Taylor
 violated the fiduciary duty that every 
investment adviser owes to its c
lients and prospective clientsŠto put
 client interests first,to deal 
with clients with the utmost honesty,
 to disclose all conf
licts or potential conf
licts of interest, and to use reasonable care in providi
ng investment advice.  Instead, 
Defendants ignored their clients™ 
interests and biased their inve
stment advice to put money in 
their own pockets.The advisory 
clients and other investors harmed
 by the Defendants included reta
il investors, and some of the harmed investors were senior citizens or individuals approaching retirement who invested money 

from their retirement funds or pension plans into the private investments recommended by the 

Defendants.  
3.In connection with steering clients into four private placement investments, 
Temenos and Taylor breached their fiduciary duty 
to advisory clients and 
prospective clients by:
failing to perform due diligence commensurate with even minimal fiduciary 
obligations (such as reviewing full financial information and investigating the truth of 
claims made by the issuers);
failing to disclose known defects that came 
to their attention, such as:a company™s 
poor financial condition, que
stionable spending prac
tices, potential liabilities, misstatements and omissions in the compan
ies™ marketing materials, and dubious 
claims by one company about its technology;
aggressively pushing advisory clients to invest in securities in which Temenos and 
Taylor had undisclosed conflicts; 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 2 of 43 3recommending investments that they knew, or
 were reckless in not knowing, were not 
suitable or appropriatefo
r particular investors;
grosslyunderstatingsignificant risks of investing in private placementsgenerally;
intentionally making numerous materially false and misleading statements and 
materially incomplete disclosures concerning the potential risks, returns, and value of 
particular private placements;
failing to disclose Temenos™s 
own failing financial condition;
giving preferential treatment to a partia
l owner of Temenos (the trust for which 
Taylor served as trustee), by permitting it to redeem its principal investment in an 
illiquid investment(a privilege denied to other clients); and
overcharging clients™ advisory fees by overv
aluing the private placement investments, 
in violation of Temenos™s own written policies. 
4.Temenos and Taylor also played an extensive role in soliciting the private 
placement investmentsin exchange
 for commissions from the private companies.  In doing so,
they illegally acted as unregistered broker-dealers when selling those investments.
5.Through the activities alleged in this Complaint,Temenosand Taylor,while 
acting as investment advisers,have employed 
devices, schemes and artif
ices to defraud their 
investment advisory clients and 
have engaged in acts, transac
tions, practices and courses of 
businesses which operated as a fraud on their i
nvestment advisory clie
nts,in violation of 
Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advi
sers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvise
rs Actﬂ).  Temenos 
violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers 
Actand Rule 206(4)-7 thereunderby failing to 
implement its written valuation policy.Taylor aided and abe
tted that violation.  And,Temenos 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 3 of 43 4and Taylor violated Section 15(a) of the Secu
rities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) by 
inducing and attempting to induce the purchase and sa
le of securities without being registered as 
a broker or dealer or being associated with a registered broker or dealer

a.entry of appropriate permanent in
junctions, including an injunction 
prohibiting Defendants from further violations of the relevant provisions of 

the federal securities laws;

gains, pluspre-judgment interest;

Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 5 of 43 6STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.Defendants Took Money to Recommend th
e Securities of Private Placement 
Companies, and Did So Without Conducting Adequate Due Diligence
14.Before 2014, Temenos and Taylor had inve
sted their advisory clients™ money 
primarily in mutual funds, exchange traded funds, 
variable annuities, and p
ublicly traded stocks.  
They charged an asset management fee to their 
clients based on the clients™ total assets under 
their management.  
15.Starting in 2014, Temenos and Taylor be
gan actively recommending the privately 
offered securities of four private companies to Temenos™s clients and prospective clients.  

Between 2014 and 2017, Defendants placed more than $19million in investments by their 

clients and others inthese four 
private issuers™ securities.  
And they did so without ever 
sufficiently examining the marketing claims, financial statements, or the business activities of 

those companies.   
16.Critically, by steering their clients™ investments into those securities of the four 
private companies, Temenos and Taylor arranged 
to covertlycollect commissions (a percentage 
of the amount invested) on top of the asset manage
ment fees their clients were already paying for 
unbiased advice.  Although their due diligence wa
s inadequate, their fina
ncial incentives to recommend these private securities offerings were not.

ssion-Based Solicitation Agreements 
with Private Placement Companies
17.Defendants recommended their clients invest in the securities offerings of at least 
four private companies:

Company Afrom their advisory clients and othe
rindividuals(certain of
 whom later became 
advisory clientsof Temenos).From Septembe
r 2014 through February 2017, pursuant to a 
ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ agreement with Company A, Temenos solicited investments in 

Company A as its ﬁfinder.ﬂ  From October 2014 through February 2017, Company A 

compensated Temenos for Temenos™s role in the private placement.Temenos, at Taylor™s 

direction and under his signature as CEO, ente
redintoa ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ with Company 
A, effective September 1, 2014.  Under that ag
reement, Temenos receive
d money equal to 2.5% 
of each investment it brought to Company A.  On September 9, 2015, Temenos and Company A 

extended that agreement and changed the comp
ensation that Temenos received.  Under the 
extended agreement, Temenos received 5% of
 each investment it brought to Company A.
20.Company B
purportedto be building a fiber opt
ic connection between locations 
along the east coast of the UnitedStates.Beg
inning on or about January 15, 2015, Company B
engaged in a private placement securities offering.
21.Temenos and Taylor solic
ited investments in Company B.  Between September 
2014and March 2017, Temenos solic
ited approximately $7 million of
 client investments in 
Company B. From January 2015 to August 2015, 
Temenos solicited investments in Company B 
through a solicitation arrangement with aninterm
ediary.  Temenos, at Taylor™s direction and 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 7 of 43 8under his signature, entered into a ﬁNon-Ex
clusive Placement Agency Agreementﬂ with 
Company B effective August 1, 2015.Under that agreement, Temenos received a fee equal to 

5% in cash and 5% in equity(that is, an ownership stake in Company B)of each investment 

brought to Company B.  From September 2015 through February 2017,Company B 

compensated Temenos directly for Temenos™s role in the solicitations.
22.Company C
marketed itselfduring the relevant time periodas a crowdfunding 
investment portal.Company C™s f
ounder and president is a former registered representative of a 
broker-dealer.Prior to founding Company C,
he owned a companythat had a solicitation 
agreement with CompanyB.Company Cemploys Taylor™s wife as Managing Director, 

Customer Experience.  Prior to that, she served as Principal Director of Investor Strategies.  She 

received stock options in Company C as part of
 her compensation.  For a short time, Defendant
Taylor served on Company C™s investment co
mmittee.  Beginning on or about March 18, 2016, 
Company Cengaged in a private placement securities offering.  
23.Temenosand Taylor solicite
d investments in Company C.  Between March 2016 
and January 2017, Defendants solicited $805,000 of
 client investment in Company C. 
24.In the meantime, shortly after Temenos and Taylor began soliciting investments 
in Company C from their clients, Temenos and Ta
ylor began to receive undisclosed payments 
from Company C.  On July 6, 2016,Company C™s 
CEO confirmed that Temenos would receive 
a fee equal to 7% of each investment it br
ought to Company C in cash, and 5% more in 
Company C equity.  On July 15, 2016, Company 
C offered Taylor an 
additional financial incentive to solicit investments, promising Ta
ylor an additional 25,000 options on purchasing 
Company C stock once Defendants had suc
cessfully solicited $500,000 
of investments for Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 8 of 43 9Company C.  The email between the CEO and Ta
ylor acknowledges that Temenos would have 
Temenos™s advisory clients invested in Compan
y C,and that Taylor would also be marketing 
Company C to non-clients as well to people ﬁb
eyond [Taylor™s] own contacts.ﬂFrom August 
2016 through December 2016, Company C compensa
ted Temenos for Temenos™s solicitations.  
In December 2016, Temenos, at Taylor™s direc
tion and under his signature, entered into a 
ﬁFinders (sic) Agreementﬂ with Company C, re
troactively effective as of February 10, 2016.  
Under that agreement, Temenos received money e
qual to 7% of each investment itbrought to 
Company C.
25.Company D
purported to have developed a ne
w water purification technology.
In or around early August 2015, approximately 
one month after two of the three Temenos 
advisory clients who invested in Company Dhad
 completed their investments,the owners of 
Company D™s parent companyfired Company D™s president, and withdrew all the money from 

Company D™s checking account. 
26.Temenos and Taylor solicited $225,000of c
lient investments in Company D.  
From in or about December 2014 to in orabout
 July 2015, Temenos, through Taylor, solicited 
investments in Company D.  Taylor expected 
that Company D would pay Temenos a 5% finder™s 
fee for investments in Company D from Temenos clients.
2.Despite Their Representations, Defendants Failed to Conduct Even the Basic 
Due DiligenceNecessary to Determine Whether the Private Placement 

Investments Were Suita
ble for Its Clients
27.Throughout the relevant period, Taylor
 made statements to clients that 
misleadingly suggested that the private pla
cement investments Temenos offered had been 
carefully vetted and selected from a large group 
of potential offerings based on their favorable 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 9 of 43 10risk/return potential, and were suitable for any we
althy investor.  They weren™t.  Defendants did 
not perform adequate due diligence before recommending that advisory clients invest in the 

private placement companies.  Instead, they r
ecommended those investments without even the 
most basic information on the companies necessary to judge the risks and rewards of those 

investmentsand with a reckless disregard for 
the truth of their st
atements about those 
investments.28.Defendants repeatedly represented that they had performed due diligence on the 
private placement investments a
nd that the investments were suitable for their clients.  For 
instance:
a.In emails sent to clients and other 
prospective investors in December 2014, May 
2015, and December 2015, Taylor wrote, ﬁWe are fortunate to see many 

opportunities in the private equity space.  
We try to select those which are lower 
risk (all private equity is risky), thos
e which exhibit exceptional return potential 
and those which are helping to ma
ke our country a better place.ﬂ
b.On May 7, 2015, Defendants emailed num
erous advisory clients and others 
soliciting themfor an investment in Company B informing clients that Temenos 

sees many opportunities to invest in priv
ate companies and tries to select those 
which are lower risk, exhibit exceptiona
l return potential, and help make the 
country a better place.  
c.In a December 2016 email to advisory client
s and others, Taylor stressed that all 
of Temenos™s private issuer securities o
fferings ﬁhave strong management teams 
and compelling business models.ﬂ
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 10 of 43 11d.In a February 2017 email to advisory c
lients and others, Taylor stated, ﬁwe don™t 
recommend every investment that we have 
access too [sic]. . . we have a process 
of due diligence and vetting.ﬂ 
In making these claims about the selection of
 investment opportunities,
 Defendants failed to notify investors that, in fact, they had not indepe
ndently assessed the risk or return potential of 
these companies.  Moreover, Defendants omitted to mention a key selection criterion for the 

private companies in questionŠthe willingness of t
hose companies to pay Taylor for every client 
dollar steered to those companies.
29.Defendants recommended advi
sory clients and prospectiv
e clients invest in these 
private companies without doing sufficient due 
diligence to determine the risk of those 
investments, the financial stability of those companies, the business prospects of the companies, 

or the suitability of the investments for particular clients.  They forwarded emails from these 

companies to their advisory clients and prospe
ctive clients without performing even minimal due 
diligence, withoutadequate effort to determine th
e accuracy of the representations they were 
sending to advisory clients, a
nd with reckless disregard for the truth of those representations.
For instance:
a.Defendants did not review financial st
atements for Company B prior to touting 
Company B to clients and prospective clie
nts.  Defendants began placing client 
funds into Company B in January 2015, well before they ever saw Company B™s 

financial information.Whe
n, much later, in July 2015, Defendants saw full 
financial information about Company B, 
they discovered that Company B did not 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 11 of 43 12have enough money to build the fiber optic
 line itclaimed to be building, and was 
using most of its money for marketing instead. 
b.Defendants failed to discoverand/or
 disclosethat, between March 2015 and 
March 2016, several lawsuits 
were filed against Company B and that Company B 
lost control of a key land parcel, whic
h significantly jeopardized Company B™s 
ability to build its fiber optic line;
c.Defendants did not conduct due dilig
ence on Company Cbefore recommending 
their clients invest.  Instead Defe
ndants relied only on their uninformed, 
subjective opinion thatCompany C had good legal counsel and a good 

compliance firm.
d.Defendants™ due diligence on Company D was limited to reading the company™s 
business plan and sending that informati
on to a couple of Defendants™ clients who 
were engineers.  One of those engineer
 clients bluntly notif
ied Defendants that 
CompanyD™stechnology was ﬁa bunch of crap.ﬂ  Taylor also declined an 

invitation from Company Dfor Taylor to visit the Company Dfacility and view 

its technology.  
e.On June 28, 2015,Taylor emailed a 
prospective investor, unreservedly 
recommending an investment in Compan
y D and asking for more investment 
money based onhis great results.  Without
 having conducted due diligence on the 
company, Taylor wrote that, ﬁ– by July they will be increasing the value of the 

company from 10 million val[uation]to $100 mil
l[ion]ﬂ and represented that the 
company would sell every unitthey make and become a dominant ﬁindustry 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 12 of 43 13disruptorﬂ that would be an ﬁ$8 billion 
business.ﬂTaylor also statedthatthe odds 
wereﬁ[o]ver 60% that technology will wo
rk as claimedﬂ and ﬁ[i]t succeeds you 
will get at least 10 to 25 times your investment–.ﬂHe had no basis for either the 

supposed calculation of the odds the technol
ogy would work or for the expected 
return on investment if it did.30.Defendants also disregarded negative 
information contained in the financial 
statementsof some of the private companies, and failed to disclose this negative information to 

advisory clientsor prospective 
clientswhen they solicited them to invest.  For instance,
Defendants knew that Company Bhad been ra
pidly using up its available cashand may be 
facing insolvency, but nevertheless recomme
nded their clients invest in Company Band 
collected its resulting commissions.
31.Defendants failed to corroborate the claims 
they later made to advisory clients and 
others about the private placement companies. 
 Defendantsdid notobtain sufficient information 
to determine the merits and suitability of the private companiesas investments they 

recommended to their advisory clients and prospe
ctive clients.  Nor did they corroborate the 
information they received from the private 
placement companiesin connection with their 
provision of investment advice.  Instead, in many cases, Defendants blindly forwarded and/or 
parroted informationreceivedfrom the privat
eplacementcompanies.Defendants failed to 
exercise reasonable care, failed to conduct su
fficient due diligence
, failed to make an 
investigation that would provide them with a re
asonable basis to believe
 their representations 
about the private placement companieswere tr
ue and accurate, andfailed to obtain the 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 13 of 43 14information necessary to determine whether the investments were suitable for their current and 
prospective advisory clients.
3.Defendants Failed Adequately to Inform Clients thatThey Were Getting 
Paid by the RecommendedPrivate Placement Companies, On Topof the 

Clients™ Advisory Fees
32.Though they were actively engaged 
in, and compensated for, soliciting 
investments in the private placement compan
ies, prior to March 31, 2015, Temenos did not 
disclose to its advisory clients that it received compensation from the private placement 

companies.Registered investment advisers are 
required to file with the Commission a document 
called the Form ADV, which is a uniform form used
 to register with the Commission or, in some 
instances, a statesecurities regula
tor.  Form ADV contains a va
riety of disclosures about the 
adviser and its advisory business 
that must be updated at least annually.  Temenos™s Form ADV 
Part II, dated March 26, 2014, ma
kes no mention of private placement or private equity 
investments.   Beginning in March 2015, Teme
nos includedagenericdisclosure in its Form 
ADVabout the possibility that it might receive ﬁfi
nder™s feesﬂ for private equity investments.  
Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 31, 2015, states, ﬁ[w]e have and may receive 

finder™s or consulting fees for recommending certain private placements or private equity deals.  

Typically these are only done with accredited 
investors whom we decide these types of 
investments are suitable for.ﬂ  In its Form
sADVPart II,datedJanuary 15, 2016and March 31, 
2017,Temenos provided slightly more disclosure
,statingthat:ﬁWe may get paid a finder™s fee 
or consulting fee for offering these typeof [private] investments to our clients –.  Our 

compensation will vary, but typically has ranged from zero to 10%.  This could include cash or 

stock compensation.ﬂ Temenos™s Form ADV Part II
 general disclosure about the possibility of 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 14 of 43 15receiving compensation was, at be
st, a half-truth, failingto alert c
lients that Temenos and Taylor 
were pocketing commissions whenthey put clients in
to particular private offerings, even while 
the clients were paying advisory fees.  Such 
general disclosures were insufficient to enable
clients to make an informed decision on whether to 
invest in a particular security, or to retain 
Temenos as an adviser.  While
 after March 31, 2015, Temenos ha
d generally disclosed that it 
ﬁmayﬂ receive a finder™s or consulting fee, it failed 
to tell clients and prospective clients that it, in fact, was routinely receiving feesfor investments in the private placement offeringsand that 

the fees were many times larger than the advisory fees the clients were paying for advice.  Nor 

did Temenos notify clientswhen Temenos and/or 
Taylor were being compensated by receiving 
ownership interests in the companies, and what ef
fect that conflict of in
terest had on Temenos™s 
investment advice.  33.In particular, Defendants repeatedly failed altogether to tell clients that 
Defendants were getting paid by the private companies at the times when Defendants were 

soliciting and investing clients™ f
unds in those companies™ offeri
ngs.  For instance, on March 6
and 19, 2015;May 7and 23, 2015; June 23, 2016;August 2, 2016;November 25, 2016;and 

December 27, 2016,Defendants sent emails to numer
ous advisory clients and otherprospective 
investors soliciting investments in Company B.These emails did not disclose that Temenos 

expected to receive as compensation from Compan
y B a percentage of the amount invested, nor 
was this information disclosed to those w
ho expressed interest 
in the investments.
34.The disclosures Defendants did make were incomplete and misleading.  For 
example, on December 10, 2014, Defendants disclosed 
to approximately 35 a
dvisory clients that 
Temenos would receive as compensation 3% of
 the amount investedin Company B.Numerous 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 15 of 43 16additional prospective investors 
received only later emails, which did not contain any such 
disclosure. By August 1, 2015, Temenos™scomp
ensation from Company Bhad increased to 5%
of the amount invested, but Defenda
nts did not disclose the increase,
 even to those who had been 
told about the 3% fee.Nor did Defendants later 
disclose this informa
tion to clients who they
recommended invest in Company B.
35.On August 15, 2015, Defendants emailednum
erous advisory clients and others 
soliciting investments in Company A.This email did not disclose that Temenos expected to 

receive a percentage of the amount i
nvested in CompanyAfrom Company Aas 
compensation.On September 23, 2015;Novemb
er 19, 2015; December 4, 2015; January 13, 
2016; April 22, 2016; May 16, 2016;June 20, 2016; August 17, 25,and 31, 2016; September 30, 

2016; October 17, 2016;November 25, 2016; 
December 27, 2016;and January 10, 2017,
Defendants sent additional emails tonumerous Temenos advisory clients soliciting investments 

in Company A.  None of these emails disclosed that Temenos expected to receive as 

compensation a percentage of the amount invest
ed.Nor did Defendants 
later disclose this 
information to clients whothey recommendedinvestin Company A.  
36.On August 2, 2016;September 19, 2016;October 18, 2016;December 27, 2016;
January 23, 2017;and January 26, 2017, Defendants 
emailed numerous advisory clients and 
others soliciting investments in Company C.Several of these emails attached Company C 

marketing materials.  Defendants did not disclose that Temenos expected to receive as 

compensation from Company C a percentage of th
e amount invested in Company C.  Nor did 
Defendants later disclose this information to clients who were considering investing in Company 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 16 of 43 17C.  The January 23, 2017 email also disclosed th
at the CEO of Company C was associated with 
Temenos, but inaccuratelyreferred to him as an ﬁSEC advisor.ﬂ  
37.Defendants failed to disclose
 several other actual or pot
ential conflicts of interest 
to clients and potential clients 
when recommending investments in the private offerings.  For 
instance:
a.Defendants did not disclose
 to clients that both Temenos and Taylor, personally, 
were under financial stress and were st
ruggling to meet operating expenses when 
they recommended that clients invest in securities for which they received, as 

compensation, a commission based upon the amount invested.
b.Defendants did not disclose their expect
ed ownership interests in Company B or 
Taylor™s expected ownership interests (or, 
for certain clients solicited at the end of 
2016,Taylor™s wife™s ownership interest
sin the form of equity options)in 
Company Cwhenadvising their clients about Company B, Company C,or 

Company C-related investments, when soliciting their clients for investment in 

Company C, or when recommending their clients invest in securities offered 

through Company C™s crowd-fundingplatform.  
c.Defendants did not disclose that Taylor
 had become actively involved in helping 
the management of Company Bas a member of Company B™s Finance 

Committee,and, for a time,was part of an ﬁadvisory committeeﬂ for Company C.
38.By failing to disclose this information to advisory clients and prospective clients 
who were solicited to invest in these companies,
 while holding themselves out as investment 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 17 of 43 18advisers, Defendants intentionall
y made fraudulent misrepresentati
ons and material omissions to 
those clients and prospective clients.  
4.Defendants Improperly Placed Client
s in Unsuitable and Highly Risky 
Investments39.Defendants recommended the private placement companyinvestments to 
all
of theirinvestor clientswho they 
believed to have sufficient income, regardless of whether those 
risky investments were right for a particular c
lient.  They emailed numer
ous advisory clients, 
recommending thatclients invest in the private 
companies™ securities, without concern for the 
clients™ personal circumstances or
 risk tolerance.  For example:
a.In June 2016, Taylor told over 100client
s by email that, ﬁ[m]utual funds and 
separate accounts are expensive and ineffi
cient. . .ﬂ and ﬁ[w]ith our accredited 
investors, private equityis a key compone
nt to increase potential return and to 
decrease overall risk.ﬂ
b.On February 13, 2017, Defendants sent a ma
ss email to Temenos 
clients stating, 
ﬁ[w]e believe that wealthy investor
s should have some private equity 
investment–.ﬂ and, ﬁ[i]ncluding more a
nd different types of private equity 
companies increases the odds that one will be successful in this asset class Œas in 

all others.ﬂ  Defendants should not have been soliciting from thei
r entire client base to invest in the private 
companies™ securitiesŠinvestments which were inherently high risk and illiquid with a long-

term and indefinite time horizon.  
40.Defendants continually recommended these private placement investments to 
specific advisory clients and prospective clients regardless of the suitability of the investments 
Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 18 of 43 19for that client.  For several clients whom De
fendantsconvinced to invest in those private 
placementofferings, those investmentswere wholly unsuitable when considering the clients™

inability to tolerate the risk of losing money on the private placement investments and when 

considering the time by which the clients would need to liquidate their investments to use the 

invested funds.  For instance, Defendants placed 
two-thirds of one partic
ularclient™s retirement 
funds into private placement investments.  This
 client, a52-year-old womanwith arisk averse
investment approach,had transferred to Teme
nos all of her retiremen
t funds(approximately 
$350,000), which had previously been invested in
 a diverse portfolio ofmutual funds and 
publicly traded common stock.  Defendants advised 
her to sell most of those investments in order to invest in three of the private placementinvestments.  Taylor told the client that the 

investments would earn her a higher
 rate of return for the fiftee
n years she plannedto continue 
working.  The client knew the companies she ha
d invested in were not yet publiclytraded, but 
did not understandthe risks associated with inve
sting in private placements.  Defendantsdid not
explain to her thatthese private placements we"
79,79,"The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to halt an ongoing offering fraud carried out by Marianne Veronika Sandor, her husband Edward Michael Porrazzo and their company, Moddha Interactive, Inc.

The SEC's complaint, which was unsealed on July 13, in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo told investors that Moddha Interactive had a valuable portfolio of patents for a supposed 3-D technology that can be used with tablet devices. As alleged in the complaint, however, this was false because Moddha Interactive's patents had expired and were worthless, and the technology they promoted either did not exist or was developed by other, unrelated companies. Also, according to the SEC's complaint, in an effort to promote the safety of the investment in Moddha Interactive, Sandor and Porrazzo lied about a share dividend buy-back program and how they would use the investor funds they raised. The complaint alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds to support their lifestyle. In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that Moddha Interactive paid over $200,000 in sales commissions to their co-defendant, Spar Street, who illegally acted as an unregistered broker in selling Moddha Interactive's shares to investors.

The SEC's complaint, filed under seal on July 9, 2018, charges Sandor, Porrazzo and Moddha Interactive with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint also charges Street with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as other emergency relief. The SEC's complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jasmine M. Starr and Carol Shau and supervised by Victoria A. Levin of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office.

This SEC enforcement action is being brought to stop an ongoingoffering fraud, where the defendants have promoted a fake technology and illusoryprospects for its commercial success to enrich themselves with investors' funds. Thefederal securities laws vest in this Court the power to enjoin, on an emergency basis,further violations of the law. The Court also has the equitable authority to freeze theassets of securities law violators for the good of defrauded investors, order them toprovide a sworn accounting of their financial affairs, and prohibit them fromdestroying relevant documents. Because defendants continue to raise money frominvestors, and have a history of quickly dissipating investor funds for their personaluse, the SEC now brings this action to secure that emergency relief from this Court.2. Defendant Moddha Interactive, Inc. (""Moddha"") calls itself a""worldwide Positive Media and Technology Corporation."" Defendants Sandor andPorrazzo, who are married, are Moddha's only officers or directors. Moddha claimsto own an ""exclusive proprietary portfolio of patents based on the QuantumTransducer ('QT'),"" a technology that will ""revolutionize"" conventional mobilephones, allow consumers to operate tablet devices ""with the wave of your hand as ifyou were Tony Stark in Iron Man,"" and produce ""a more elegant, thinner, healthierand more energy-efficient device than iPhone and Android."" In meetings withpotential investors, Moddha demonstrated a tablet device, similar to an iPad butcapable of displaying 3D images, that supposedly incorporated Moddha's patented""QT"" technology. Sandor and Porrazzo also burnished Moddha's commercial bonafides with claims that it had just become a ""Registered Supplier"" of a globaltelecommunications firm (""Global Telecommunications Firm""). On the basis of thispresumed technology, Moddha has raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors since2012 through a private placement offering of its unregistered securities. These funds,however, were procured by fraud: Moddha's purported ""Quantum Transducer""COMPLAINT 1Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 2 of 27     PageID #: 2 technology is a sham.3. In truth, Moddha's intellectual property portfolio consists of only ahandful of patents, all of which are expired and thus commercially worthless. Thedevices touted by Moddha's offering materials and demonstrated by Sandor andPorrazzo to potential investors were either fake, or were designed and developed byother companies. Moddha never had, and continues to have no business relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm. And instead of using investor funds instrict accordance with the limitations contained in Moddha's private placementmemorandum, the majority of the money Moddha raised in the last year has beenmisappropriated through transfers to Sandor and Porrazzo's personal accounts andspent on personal things that have nothing to do with the business, including a 7-nightstay at a luxury hotel the week of Thanksgiving in 2017.4. Investor money was also funneled to defendant Spar Street, to pay himsales commissions for acting as a sales agent for the offering and drumming up newinvestors. Street, however, has never registered with the SEC to be a broker.5. When confronted by their investors, Sandor and Porrazzo compoundedtheir lies, repeatedly claiming that a large influx of funds was imminent andModdha's investors would soon be made whole through a dividend share buyback.They claimed this new money would come from the Global TelecommunicationsFirm, or from a wealthy investor whose forthcoming $150 million investment inModdha was delayed, the defendants claimed, due to a variety of excuses, includingsickness, gun violence at an embassy, and the eruption of a volcano in Iceland. Thiswas false - the Global Telecommunications firm does not do business with Moddhaat all, and there is no imminent new funding from some alleged wealthy investor. Inspite of defendants' increasingly outlandish excuses, Moddha's expired patentportfolio and sham business had no prospect of generating real returns for itsinvestors.6.

In addition,venue is proper in this district because defendants Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street residein this district, and defendant Moddha has its principal place of business in thisdistrict.DEFENDANTS10.

Defendant Marianne Veronika Sandor, age 48, is a resident of Hana,Hawaii. She is Moddha's chairman and chief executive officer. Along withdefendant Porrazzo, Sandor is a signatory to Moddha's corporate bank accounts.12. Defendant Edward Michael Porrazzo is 61 years old and a resident ofHana, Hawaii. He is Moddha's chief technology officer, secretary, and treasurer, andis Sandor's spouse.13. Defendant Spar Street, age 55, is a resident of Haiku, Hawaii. Streetacted as a sales agent for Moddha by identifying potential investors, promotingModdha to them, and arranging meetings between them and defendants Sandor andPorrazzo to discuss potential investment. Street is also a member of Moddha's so-called ""Board of Advisors."" Street is not registered as a broker-dealer or associatedwith a registered broker-dealer.THE ALLEGATIONSA. Moddha's Securities Offering14. In a November 2014 filing and a February 2018 amended filing with theSEC, Moddha stated that it had been engaged in an offering of unregistered securitiessince July 7, 2012. Moddha's SEC filings further stated that as of December 31,2017, the company had raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors located in multiplestates.15. Moddha solicits investors for its securities offering through thecompany's website, online professional profiles for Sandor and Porrazzo, the use ofsales agents, in-person meetings with potential investors, and written offeringmaterials provided to investors and potential investors, including a private placementmemorandum (""PPM""), and has been doing so since at least 2015.16. Porrazzo and Sandor are Moddha's chief technology officer andchairman/chief executive officer, respectively; they are Moddha's only officers ordirectors; they possess sole control over decisions concerning Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 4Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 5 of 27     PageID #: 5 management, operation, and policies; they affixed their names to many of the writtenmaterials provided by the company to potential investors, and thus, on informationand belief, Porrazzo and Sandor each had ultimate authority over the content ofModdha's offering materials, including its PPM, and whether and how tocommunicate that content to investors and potential investors.17. In its offering materials, Moddha dubbed itself as a ""worldwide PositiveMedia and Technology Corporation.""18. Moddha's PPM described its purported business in sprawling terms,claiming that it is; (i) poised to profit from ""consumer product sales, subscriptionservices; including vast licensing dollars with its proprietary hardware, software andoriginal content in diverse global industries""; (ii) ""currently offeringtelecommunications products and services licenses worldwide, with an initial focuson the Middle East and Africa, Western and Eastern Europe, South America, Mexico,Central America and the Caribbean, with future plans to expand into Asia, India,North America and beyond""; and (iii) creating ""its own proprietary content and alsoacquiring existing media, such as documentary films and educational games as wellas feature films, for providing to its Global Digital Subscription Network, connectingschools world-wide.""19. A key representation in the PPM is that Moddha ""owns an exclusive,proprietary portfolio of patents based on the Quantum Transducer (QT).""20. When describing its purported Quantum Transducer, ""QT"" technology,the company's PPM claimed that:a. ""There is at least one transducer in everything electronic andabout 15 transducers in a cellphone. All other transducers perform only one function... QT performs multiple functions and frequencies simultaneously, sending andreceiving without interference on the same paper-thin surface.""b. ""QT replaces conventional transducers ... QTs reduce harmfulradiation. QTs reduce the cost of manufacturing. QTs reduce the cost of cellularCOMPLAINT 5Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 6 of 27     PageID #: 6 networks and extend ranges and capabilities, especially in expanding rural areas.QTs greatly increase battery life, data transfer rates and data capacity. MODDHA'sQT revolutionizes conventional cellphones.""c. ""QTs operate with such levels of efficiency, improvement andcost-effectiveness that QT's transform all electronics and offer entirely new ways ofharnessing wireless electricity that can help bring balance to the planet.""21. Moddha also represented in its offering materials that its proprietary QTtechnology had been incorporated in an array of Moddha products, including whatModdha called its ""Q-Tablet"" and ""Q-Connect Smart Phone"" devices.22. According to Moddha's PPM, its ""patented revolutionary QT technologyprovides a new interface to create and distribute 3-D interactive content"" through aproprietary touchscreen that Moddha called, ""WaveScreen,"" which ""allows you tomanipulate and interact with your device in 3-D with the wave of your hand, as if youwere Tony Stark in Iron Man. But QT and the WaveScreen aren't science fiction;they are science-fact.""23. Having incorporated the QT-enabled ""WaveScreen"" interface into itsproducts, Moddha's PPM claimed that ""MODDHA is positioned to change the faceof consumer electronics, media, telemedicine and education by featuring the QTWaveScreen interactive display interface technology, on its Q-Tablet and Q-ConnectSmart Phone devices.""24. This was all a sham. Moddha's extravagant claims of having secured theintellectual property rights for a ground-breaking technology that would transform theconsumer electronics, media, telemedicine, and educational markets were uniformlyfalse.25. Moddha had no true revenue-generating relationships with anyone, muchless as a ""Registered Supplier"" to the Global Telecommunications Firm.26. At bottom, Moddha's unregistered securities offering was simply ameans to fund Sandor's and Porrazzo's lifestyle, in stark contravention of Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 6Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 7 of 27     PageID #: 7 PPM, which explicitly set forth how investor funds were to be used.27. Moddha's offering is ongoing, and defendants are continuing to solicitinvestors and obtain investor funds.B. The Material Misrepresentations and Omissions1. Moddha's Expired and Worthless Patent Portfolio28. To convince potential investors that it could profit from its technology,Moddha needed them to believe that the company had intellectual property rights toQT.29. On that subject, Moddha's PPM repeatedly stressed that it owned avaluable and expansive portfolio of patents which covered the purported QTtechnology:a. ""MODDHA owns its own exclusive proprietary portfolio ofpatents based on the Quantum Transducer ('QT') that simplifies, harmonizes andexpands the capabilities currently offered by conventional communications,electronics, display interfaces and wireless delivery.""b. ""MODDHA believes its patents comprise the hardware formodem-day touch-screens.""c. ""MODDHA is poised to capture a dominant position in today'scellular telecom market with its patented QT technology that increases reception andtransmission quality ...""d. ""MODDHA'S patented, multi-functional transducer technologyhas the potential to provide not only significant incremental changes, but also long-term, dismptive replacements in nearly every major industry worldwide.""e. ""The proven history of QT has opened the door for manysuccessful high-tech companies like Apple, Philips Electronics,Google/HTC/Motorola and Samsung, to catapult themselves to over $50 billionannually with the use of trade secrets, IP and patented technologies that are nowowned and protected by MODDHA. MODDHA desires to collect infringementCOMPLAINT 7Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 8 of 27     PageID #: 8 damages from companies once they have been legally judged to have infringed or tohave agreed to settle.""30. In the same vein, Moddha's offering summary - which bears bothSandor and Porrazzo's names - claims that ""MODDHA owns its own exclusiveproprietary portfolio of patents based on Quantum Transduction ('QT') that iselegant, simple and expands the capabilities currently offered by conventionalcommunications, electronics, display interfaces, wireless delivery, wearabletechnology and 3D interactivity.""31. Sandor and Porrazzo also affixed their names to a PowerPointpresentation used with investors, which referred to Moddha's ""proprietarytechnologies"" and similarly represented that Moddha had a ""Well Protected,Established, Mature Intellectual Property Estate.""32. Porrazzo and Sandor also represented, during in-person meetings withpotential investors, that Moddha owned patents which covered its technology. Theserepresentations were specifically made in an October 2017 meeting with a marriedcouple who were solicited to invest.33. These representations of an immensely valuable and enforceable patentportfolio were false.34. Moddha owns only five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (""USPTO"") related to transducers and speakers. The five patents wereassigned to Moddha in 2011.35. At the time they were assigned to Moddha, two of Moddha's five patentshad already expired. Those two patents had expired by operation of law in 2004because of the patent-holder's failure to pay the required maintenance fees with theUSPTO.36. The last three Moddha patents had all expired as of May 2014 becauseeach patent's statutory patent term had expired.37. In 2017, a consultant to several of Moddha's investors confrontedCOMPLAINT 8Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 9 of 27     PageID #: 9 Porrazzo and Sandor about Moddha's expired patent portfolio. Porrazzo and Sandoradmitted that Moddha's patent portfolio had expired.38. Moddha, Sandor, and Porrazzo's representations that Moddha heldenforceable intellectual property rights for its claimed technological innovation wereimportant to Moddha investors when they decided to invest their money in Moddha'sunregistered securities. The purported QT technology was central to the company'sbusiness, and without patent protection for that technology and the products whichembodied it, Moddha would not be able to commercially profit from it.2. Lies About Moddha's Ability to Buyback ""Share Dividends""39. Since at least 2015, when offering Moddha securities, Sandor andPorrazzo communicated to investors and potential investors that Moddha was a safeinvestment because they would at least get all of their invested capital back throughModdha's ""founder's"" share program.40. Sandor and Porrazzo represented that if investors purchased Moddha'ssecurities within a limited window of time, investors would receive ""founder's""shares that provided an automatic share dividend equal to the amount invested; inother words, a ""two for one"" deal. For example, a purchase of 100 ""founder's"" shareswould entitle the investor to an immediate dividend of another 100 shares.41. Sandor and Porrazzo also told investors that Moddha was on the cusp ofreceiving a large infusion of capital that would allow the company to buy back thedividend shares, thereby returning the investor's capital while still giving them theability to participate in future gains.42. In 2015, Porrazzo and Sandor claimed that this impending infusion ofcapital was going to come from a wealthy investor who would put $ 150 million intoModdha.43. In one case, in or about 2015, Sandor showed an investor an email thatpurportedly confirmed another person's commitment to transfer $150 million toModdha.COMPLAINT 9Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 10 of 27     PageID #: 10 44. As time passed, however, and the investor questioned Porrazzo andSandor about when the capital infusion would in fact occur, Sandor provided thatinvestor with increasingly absurd explanations for the delay.45. Sandor claimed first, that the $150 million investor was sick, and thenthat he was delayed by a shooting at a foreign embassy, and finally that the $150million payment was held up because the investor's flight had been grounded by theeruption of an Icelandic volcano.46. In the end, the purported $ 150 million cash infusion never came, andModdha never returned the inquiring investor's funds.47. More recently, Sandor and Porrazzo have told investors that thecompany would be able to buy back investors' dividend shares with revenues from itscommercial relationship with the Global Telecommunications Firm.48. As just one example, Porrazzo and Sandor met in October 2017 with twopotential investors who owned a local business in Hawaii.49. After demonstrating Moddha's purported Q-Tablet and claiming that theproduct had been patented, Sandor also provided the potential investors with aPowerPoint presentation that prominently featured the Global TelecommunicationsFirm's trademark logo throughout, which was entitled ""[Global TelecommunicationsFirm] Business Case for Moddha Spatial 3D Q-Tablet & Software Apps.""50. In her transmitting email, Sandor told the potential investors that:As I mentioned, we have just become a registered supplier with[Global Telecommunications Firm]. I have included our veryCONFIDENTIAL MODDHA - [GLOBALTELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRM] Deck. (Please do notdistribute). It is only 7 slides and encapsulates much and willexplain the products we will be bringing to the market. :)51. Every slide of the PowerPoint presentation Sandor sent contained theGlobal Telecommunications Firm's trademark, and the presentation stressed amongother things that, ""[Global Telecommunications Firm] profits from the $113 billionCOMPLAINT 10Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 11 of 27     PageID #: 11 3D Display market, selling exclusive Moddha S3D Tablets.""52. The husband and wife business owners subsequently invested $500,000in exchange for 5,000 of the company's supposed ""founder's"" shares. Like otherinvestors, the couple were told by Sandor and Porrazzo that they would be receiving ashare dividend of another 5,000 shares, which they could quickly redeem withModdha through a share buyback, thus recouping their $500,000 capital investmentwhile still holding on to their original 5,000 shares of Moddha stock.53. In a November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor again touted thecompany's supposed dividend share buyback program: ""MODDHA intends to offera full cash redemption of your MODDHA Dividend Share Certificates at the issueprice the dividend was made equaling $100 per share ... To our knowledge and byour research, MODDHA is the only Private Company in history, who will have everprovided a 100% return dividend, and we are excited to blaze the trail for othercompanies to follow.""54. In this same November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor repeated theclaim that Moddha was ""now a Registered Supplier to [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm]"" and also included the same PowerPoint presentationcontaining the Global Telecommunications Firm's trademark.55. The November 3, 2017 shareholder update also included new claims that""the powerpoint [sic] ... was circulated amongst the higher ups of [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm] and received a resounding unanimous vote to partner withMODDHA. [The Global Telecommunications Firm] has requested to sell MODDHAproducts in all [the Global Telecommunications Firm's] Stores Nationwide. There isa desire from [the Global Telecommunications Firm] to co-brand the Q-Tablet andQuartz headset. We are considering the request.""56. Months later, after their share redemption still had not occurred, thehusband and wife Moddha investors received a January 2018 email from Sandorattempting to explain the delay:COMPLAINT 11Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 12 of 27     PageID #: 12 Greetings and Aloha MODDHA Shareholders ... This is a quicknote to let you know that our executive team, Fsicl were all downand offline for the past 5 weeks with this horrible high feverbronchial flu. Fortunately, we have all recovered and despite nothaving any holiday at all, nor any Christmas, nor New Year'scelebration with our families, we have made it through and aretoday back to work.We have been advised that there were some remaining ...documents required to be executed with [Moddha's transferagent.] We are now executing those documents so that [thetransfer agent] can be fully empowered ... and provide therequired services for your share dividend redemption ... Althoughit was out of our control that our whole team came down with thisviolent influenza at such a critical moment, we wish to apologizeto each of you, for any hardship this delay, and/or our being out oftouch has caused to you.57. Then in April 2018, Sandor sent another shareholder update claimingthat the share buyback was merely awaiting ""final approval from securities counsel.""58. Despite Sandor's promises, Moddha has never redeemed the husbandand wife's ""founder's"" shares. The company has not returned any portion of the$500,000 they invested in the company last fall.59. Sandor and Porrazzo have never told investors that Moddha didn't havethe financial wherewithal to make a share buyback or that the claimed relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm was categorically false.60. From January 2017 to April 2018, the daily ledger balance on Moddha'sbank account has never exceeded $200,000.61. Moddha is not a ""Registered Supplier"" of the GlobalTelecommunications Firm.62. The Global Telecommunications Firm never authorized Moddha to useits name or trademark in connection with Moddha's solicitation of investors, or forany other purpose.COMPLAINT 12Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 13 of 27     PageID #: 13 63. The Global Telecommunications Firm has never asked to sell Moddhaproducts in any of its stores.64. Moddha has not received a single dollar in sales, licensing, or otherrevenue from the Global Telecommunications Firm.65. Moddha's, Sandor's, and Porrazzo's representations that investors wouldbe able to quickly recoup their invested capital, while still maintaining an equity stakein Moddha going forward, were important to Moddha investors. Moddha, Sandor,and Porrazzo's claims that the dividend share buyback would be paid for by,alternatively, an impending $ 150 million transfer from an individual investor, orrevenues generated through Moddha's commercial relationship with the GlobalTelecommunications Firm, were likewise significant to investors' decision to invest.That is because these false statements went to a fundamental feature of theinvestment Š the safety of the investment and whether Moddha investors wereguaranteed to at least the return of their invested capital.3. Misrepresentations About How Investor Funds Would Be Used66. Sandor and Porrazzo are the only signatories on Moddha's corporatebank accounts.67. Moddha's PPM contains a detailed description and table stating thatfunds raised from investors would be used on specific business-related costs.68. Among other things, the PPM stated that funds were to be used to ""buildand install the dedicated servers for the global network, to produce the Q-ConnectSmart Phone and Q-Tablet, to manufacture the ready prototype products, [and] todevelop and integrate the Wave Screen interface onto the QT products.""69. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo made specific representations toinvestors in personal meetings about how their investments would be used.70. For example, one investor was told, in or about summer 2015, thatModdha specifically needed the funds for manufacturing its Q-Tablet in China.71. Other investors understood from Porrazzo and Sandor that the moneyCOMPLAINT 13Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 14 of 27     PageID #: 14 they invested would be used by Moddha for its business, rather than for Porrazzo'sand Sandor's personal expenses.72. These representations concerning how Moddha, Porrazzo, and Sandorwould use money raised from the company's investors were false. Of theapproximately $827,025 in investor funds raised from January 2017 to April 2018,for instance, the majority of that money was diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo for theirpersonal use or to co-defendant Street as commissions.73. The following chart shows how the $827,025 of investor money wasdiverted to Sandor, Porrazzo and Street:n-Tvpe^ExpenseNet Transfers to Sandor's and Porrazzo's personalaccounts, including transfer to overseas account$221,373Commission payments to Spar Street, the sales agent$104,835Travel (including airfare, Airbnb, and hotels)$51,227Auto (including lease, service, and fuel)$15,372Retail (including grocery, liquor, and departmentstores)$13,830Restaurants$7,461ATM cash withdrawals$3,953Sandor and Porrazzo's charity in Kenya$2,200Percentage of Investor FundsŁ 51%74. Included in these funds diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo were amountsspent at retailers of products that have no evident business purpose, such as TheHome Depot, Liquor Barn, Target, and Walgreens.75. One egregious example occurred from November 19 to 26, 2017 duringThanksgiving week. In that week, Sandor and Porrazzo used Moddha investor fundsto stay at a luxury hotel in Santa Monica, California, where they spent upwards ofCOMPLAINT14Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 15 of 27     PageID #: 15 $2,400 a night on a room and purchased hundreds of dollars of food, drink, and spatreatments, including a $425 bottle of wine. All told, Sandor and Porrazzo's seven-night stay at the hotel was paid for with $15,884.01 in investor funds.76. In the same vein, on May 3, 2017, a Moddha investor transferred$50,000 to the company. Sandor and Porrazzo immediately misappropriated thesefunds, transferring $20,000 of that amount to Porrazzo's bank account the same day.77. And in the most recent set of corporate bank records obtained during theSEC's pre-filing investigation, Moddha's beginning account balance on April 1, 2018had dwindled to $6,036.91. On April 3, 2018, a Moddha investor transferred $50,000to the company. Once again, Sandor and Porrazzo quickly caused $10,000 ininvestor funds to be diverted to their personal and joint bank accounts, on the verysame day those investor funds first came in to Moddha's corporate account.78. In addition to these personal transfers, Sandor and Porrazzo spent$182,964 to satisfy two legal judgments against Moddha from January 2017 to April2018.79. In that time period, there is no indication in Moddha's bank records thatinvestor funds were used to manufacture QT products.80. Investors would have wanted to know that money raised by Moddha'sstock offering would not be used for working capital, as stated in the PPM, andinstead be diverted to Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street.C. The Scheme to Defraud Investors81. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated investor money bytransferring funds from Moddha's corporate account, for which Sandor and Porrazzowere the only two signatories, for their personal use.82. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo also gave potential and current investorsthe false appearance that Moddha's business was real, and that its supposed QTtechnology had already been incorporated into tangible and innovative products.83. Their artifice was simple, yet effective: Sandor and PorrazzoCOMPLAINT 15Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 16 of 27     PageID #: 16 demonstrated products in meetings with investors, including the Q-Tablet featured inthe company's offering materials, when in fact the products they showed investorswere made by unrelated companies and did not incorporate any of Moddha's claimedtechnology.84. In particular, the Q-Tablet - which did generate a 3D image that manypotential investors found impressive - used by Sandor and Porrazzo for productdemonstrations was instead designed and manufactured by a wholly-unrelated third-party technology company. In 2017, Sandor admitted to an investor consultant thatanother company owned and had developed the tablet used in Moddha'sdemonstrations, but insisted that Moddha owned 51 % of that other company. Whenpressed for documentation of Moddha's ownership, Sandor changed her story andsaid that the demonstration tablet had really been manufactured by a San FranciscoBay Area company that she refused to identify.85. Similarly, Moddha's offering materials contained images of otherproducts supposedly being developed by Moddha, including ""wearable technology,""""bone induction headphones,"" and a QT-powered speaker. Those images, though,were faked - the photos were of other companies' products that had been altered toappear as if they had been developed by Moddha.86. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo showed investors pre-produced videosthat purported to show Moddha's products working as claimed, but when an investorconsultant asked them to reproduce those results in a real-life setting, Sandor andPorrazzo refused to do so.87. Sandor and Porrazzo engaged in a bait and switch, enticing investors toinvest by telling them they would get a share dividend equal to 100% of theirinvestment (the bait), when in reality, Moddha lacked the funds to follow through ona promised buyback of investors' share dividend, and instead gave investorsprogressively more absurd excuses as to why the new funding never came (theswitch).COMPLAINT 16Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 17 of 27     PageID #: 17 88. Sandor and Porrazzo also lied to investors to lull them into believingnothing was wrong and to avoid any detection of their fraud.89. In November 2017, Sandor"
80,80,"The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to halt an ongoing offering fraud carried out by Marianne Veronika Sandor, her husband Edward Michael Porrazzo and their company, Moddha Interactive, Inc.

The SEC's complaint, which was unsealed on July 13, in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo told investors that Moddha Interactive had a valuable portfolio of patents for a supposed 3-D technology that can be used with tablet devices. As alleged in the complaint, however, this was false because Moddha Interactive's patents had expired and were worthless, and the technology they promoted either did not exist or was developed by other, unrelated companies. Also, according to the SEC's complaint, in an effort to promote the safety of the investment in Moddha Interactive, Sandor and Porrazzo lied about a share dividend buy-back program and how they would use the investor funds they raised. The complaint alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds to support their lifestyle. In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that Moddha Interactive paid over $200,000 in sales commissions to their co-defendant, Spar Street, who illegally acted as an unregistered broker in selling Moddha Interactive's shares to investors.

The SEC's complaint, filed under seal on July 9, 2018, charges Sandor, Porrazzo and Moddha Interactive with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint also charges Street with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as other emergency relief. The SEC's complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties.

CLERKUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTDISTRICT OF HAWAIISECURITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,Plaintiff,vs.MODDHA INTERACTIVE, INC.,MARIANNE VERONIKA SANDOR,EDWARD MICHAEL PORRAZZO,and SPAR STREET,Defendants.c^48 00264DKwBI'COMPLAINT(FILED UNDER SEAL)COMPLAINTCase 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 1 of 27     PageID #: 1 Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") alleges:SUMMARY1. This SEC enforcement action is being brought to stop an ongoingoffering fraud, where the defendants have promoted a fake technology and illusoryprospects for its commercial success to enrich themselves with investors' funds. Thefederal securities laws vest in this Court the power to enjoin, on an emergency basis,further violations of the law. The Court also has the equitable authority to freeze theassets of securities law violators for the good of defrauded investors, order them toprovide a sworn accounting of their financial affairs, and prohibit them fromdestroying relevant documents. Because defendants continue to raise money frominvestors, and have a history of quickly dissipating investor funds for their personaluse, the SEC now brings this action to secure that emergency relief from this Court.2. Defendant Moddha Interactive, Inc. (""Moddha"") calls itself a""worldwide Positive Media and Technology Corporation."" Defendants Sandor andPorrazzo, who are married, are Moddha's only officers or directors. Moddha claimsto own an ""exclusive proprietary portfolio of patents based on the QuantumTransducer ('QT'),"" a technology that will ""revolutionize"" conventional mobilephones, allow consumers to operate tablet devices ""with the wave of your hand as ifyou were Tony Stark in Iron Man,"" and produce ""a more elegant, thinner, healthierand more energy-efficient device than iPhone and Android."" In meetings withpotential investors, Moddha demonstrated a tablet device, similar to an iPad butcapable of displaying 3D images, that supposedly incorporated Moddha's patented""QT"" technology. Sandor and Porrazzo also burnished Moddha's commercial bonafides with claims that it had just become a ""Registered Supplier"" of a globaltelecommunications firm (""Global Telecommunications Firm""). On the basis of thispresumed technology, Moddha has raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors since2012 through a private placement offering of its unregistered securities. These funds,however, were procured by fraud: Moddha's purported ""Quantum Transducer""COMPLAINT 1Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 2 of 27     PageID #: 2 technology is a sham.3. In truth, Moddha's intellectual property portfolio consists of only ahandful of patents, all of which are expired and thus commercially worthless. Thedevices touted by Moddha's offering materials and demonstrated by Sandor andPorrazzo to potential investors were either fake, or were designed and developed byother companies. Moddha never had, and continues to have no business relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm. And instead of using investor funds instrict accordance with the limitations contained in Moddha's private placementmemorandum, the majority of the money Moddha raised in the last year has beenmisappropriated through transfers to Sandor and Porrazzo's personal accounts andspent on personal things that have nothing to do with the business, including a 7-nightstay at a luxury hotel the week of Thanksgiving in 2017.4. Investor money was also funneled to defendant Spar Street, to pay himsales commissions for acting as a sales agent for the offering and drumming up newinvestors. Street, however, has never registered with the SEC to be a broker.5. When confronted by their investors, Sandor and Porrazzo compoundedtheir lies, repeatedly claiming that a large influx of funds was imminent andModdha's investors would soon be made whole through a dividend share buyback.They claimed this new money would come from the Global TelecommunicationsFirm, or from a wealthy investor whose forthcoming $150 million investment inModdha was delayed, the defendants claimed, due to a variety of excuses, includingsickness, gun violence at an embassy, and the eruption of a volcano in Iceland. Thiswas false - the Global Telecommunications firm does not do business with Moddhaat all, and there is no imminent new funding from some alleged wealthy investor. Inspite of defendants' increasingly outlandish excuses, Moddha's expired patentportfolio and sham business had no prospect of generating real returns for itsinvestors.6. By engaging in this conduct; (i) defendants Moddha, Sandor, andCOMPLAINT 2Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 3 of 27     PageID #: 3 Porrazzo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15U.S.C. § 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and RulelOb-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5; and (ii) defendant Street violated thebroker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.§ 780(a).JURISDICTION AND VENUE7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b),20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d)(l) & 77v(a), and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e) and 27(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(l),78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e) & 78aa(a).8. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means orinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a nationalsecurities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses ofbusiness alleged in this complaint.9. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the SecuritiesAct, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of conduct constitutingviolations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district. In addition,venue is proper in this district because defendants Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street residein this district, and defendant Moddha has its principal place of business in thisdistrict.DEFENDANTS10. Defendant Moddha Interactive, Inc. was formed in 2002, incorporated inHawaii, and its principal place of business is Kahului, Hawaii. Moddha is notregistered with the SEC in any capacity. The company's securities are not registeredwith the SEC, nor are they listed on any exchange.

Defendant Marianne Veronika Sandor, age 48, is a resident of Hana,Hawaii. She is Moddha's chairman and chief executive officer. Along withdefendant Porrazzo, Sandor is a signatory to Moddha's corporate bank accounts.12. Defendant Edward Michael Porrazzo is 61 years old and a resident ofHana, Hawaii. He is Moddha's chief technology officer, secretary, and treasurer, andis Sandor's spouse.13. Defendant Spar Street, age 55, is a resident of Haiku, Hawaii. Streetacted as a sales agent for Moddha by identifying potential investors, promotingModdha to them, and arranging meetings between them and defendants Sandor andPorrazzo to discuss potential investment. Street is also a member of Moddha's so-called ""Board of Advisors."" Street is not registered as a broker-dealer or associatedwith a registered broker-dealer.THE ALLEGATIONSA. Moddha's Securities Offering14. In a November 2014 filing and a February 2018 amended filing with theSEC, Moddha stated that it had been engaged in an offering of unregistered securitiessince July 7, 2012. Moddha's SEC filings further stated that as of December 31,2017, the company had raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors located in multiplestates.15. Moddha solicits investors for its securities offering through thecompany's website, online professional profiles for Sandor and Porrazzo, the use ofsales agents, in-person meetings with potential investors, and written offeringmaterials provided to investors and potential investors, including a private placementmemorandum (""PPM""), and has been doing so since at least 2015.16. Porrazzo and Sandor are Moddha's chief technology officer andchairman/chief executive officer, respectively; they are Moddha's only officers ordirectors; they possess sole control over decisions concerning Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 4Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 5 of 27     PageID #: 5 management, operation, and policies; they affixed their names to many of the writtenmaterials provided by the company to potential investors, and thus, on informationand belief, Porrazzo and Sandor each had ultimate authority over the content ofModdha's offering materials, including its PPM, and whether and how tocommunicate that content to investors and potential investors.17. In its offering materials, Moddha dubbed itself as a ""worldwide PositiveMedia and Technology Corporation.""18. Moddha's PPM described its purported business in sprawling terms,claiming that it is; (i) poised to profit from ""consumer product sales, subscriptionservices; including vast licensing dollars with its proprietary hardware, software andoriginal content in diverse global industries""; (ii) ""currently offeringtelecommunications products and services licenses worldwide, with an initial focuson the Middle East and Africa, Western and Eastern Europe, South America, Mexico,Central America and the Caribbean, with future plans to expand into Asia, India,North America and beyond""; and (iii) creating ""its own proprietary content and alsoacquiring existing media, such as documentary films and educational games as wellas feature films, for providing to its Global Digital Subscription Network, connectingschools world-wide.""19. A key representation in the PPM is that Moddha ""owns an exclusive,proprietary portfolio of patents based on the Quantum Transducer (QT).""20. When describing its purported Quantum Transducer, ""QT"" technology,the company's PPM claimed that:a. ""There is at least one transducer in everything electronic andabout 15 transducers in a cellphone. All other transducers perform only one function... QT performs multiple functions and frequencies simultaneously, sending andreceiving without interference on the same paper-thin surface.""b. ""QT replaces conventional transducers ... QTs reduce harmfulradiation. QTs reduce the cost of manufacturing. QTs reduce the cost of cellularCOMPLAINT 5Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 6 of 27     PageID #: 6 networks and extend ranges and capabilities, especially in expanding rural areas.QTs greatly increase battery life, data transfer rates and data capacity. MODDHA'sQT revolutionizes conventional cellphones.""c. ""QTs operate with such levels of efficiency, improvement andcost-effectiveness that QT's transform all electronics and offer entirely new ways ofharnessing wireless electricity that can help bring balance to the planet.""21. Moddha also represented in its offering materials that its proprietary QTtechnology had been incorporated in an array of Moddha products, including whatModdha called its ""Q-Tablet"" and ""Q-Connect Smart Phone"" devices.22. According to Moddha's PPM, its ""patented revolutionary QT technologyprovides a new interface to create and distribute 3-D interactive content"" through aproprietary touchscreen that Moddha called, ""WaveScreen,"" which ""allows you tomanipulate and interact with your device in 3-D with the wave of your hand, as if youwere Tony Stark in Iron Man. But QT and the WaveScreen aren't science fiction;they are science-fact.""23. Having incorporated the QT-enabled ""WaveScreen"" interface into itsproducts, Moddha's PPM claimed that ""MODDHA is positioned to change the faceof consumer electronics, media, telemedicine and education by featuring the QTWaveScreen interactive display interface technology, on its Q-Tablet and Q-ConnectSmart Phone devices.""24. This was all a sham. Moddha's extravagant claims of having secured theintellectual property rights for a ground-breaking technology that would transform theconsumer electronics, media, telemedicine, and educational markets were uniformlyfalse.25. Moddha had no true revenue-generating relationships with anyone, muchless as a ""Registered Supplier"" to the Global Telecommunications Firm.26. At bottom, Moddha's unregistered securities offering was simply ameans to fund Sandor's and Porrazzo's lifestyle, in stark contravention of Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 6Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 7 of 27     PageID #: 7 PPM, which explicitly set forth how investor funds were to be used.27. Moddha's offering is ongoing, and defendants are continuing to solicitinvestors and obtain investor funds.B. The Material Misrepresentations and Omissions1. Moddha's Expired and Worthless Patent Portfolio28. To convince potential investors that it could profit from its technology,Moddha needed them to believe that the company had intellectual property rights toQT.29. On that subject, Moddha's PPM repeatedly stressed that it owned avaluable and expansive portfolio of patents which covered the purported QTtechnology:a. ""MODDHA owns its own exclusive proprietary portfolio ofpatents based on the Quantum Transducer ('QT') that simplifies, harmonizes andexpands the capabilities currently offered by conventional communications,electronics, display interfaces and wireless delivery.""b. ""MODDHA believes its patents comprise the hardware formodem-day touch-screens.""c. ""MODDHA is poised to capture a dominant position in today'scellular telecom market with its patented QT technology that increases reception andtransmission quality ...""d. ""MODDHA'S patented, multi-functional transducer technologyhas the potential to provide not only significant incremental changes, but also long-term, dismptive replacements in nearly every major industry worldwide.""e. ""The proven history of QT has opened the door for manysuccessful high-tech companies like Apple, Philips Electronics,Google/HTC/Motorola and Samsung, to catapult themselves to over $50 billionannually with the use of trade secrets, IP and patented technologies that are nowowned and protected by MODDHA. MODDHA desires to collect infringementCOMPLAINT 7Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 8 of 27     PageID #: 8 damages from companies once they have been legally judged to have infringed or tohave agreed to settle.""30. In the same vein, Moddha's offering summary - which bears bothSandor and Porrazzo's names - claims that ""MODDHA owns its own exclusiveproprietary portfolio of patents based on Quantum Transduction ('QT') that iselegant, simple and expands the capabilities currently offered by conventionalcommunications, electronics, display interfaces, wireless delivery, wearabletechnology and 3D interactivity.""31. Sandor and Porrazzo also affixed their names to a PowerPointpresentation used with investors, which referred to Moddha's ""proprietarytechnologies"" and similarly represented that Moddha had a ""Well Protected,Established, Mature Intellectual Property Estate.""32. Porrazzo and Sandor also represented, during in-person meetings withpotential investors, that Moddha owned patents which covered its technology. Theserepresentations were specifically made in an October 2017 meeting with a marriedcouple who were solicited to invest.33. These representations of an immensely valuable and enforceable patentportfolio were false.34. Moddha owns only five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (""USPTO"") related to transducers and speakers. The five patents wereassigned to Moddha in 2011.35. At the time they were assigned to Moddha, two of Moddha's five patentshad already expired. Those two patents had expired by operation of law in 2004because of the patent-holder's failure to pay the required maintenance fees with theUSPTO.36. The last three Moddha patents had all expired as of May 2014 becauseeach patent's statutory patent term had expired.37. In 2017, a consultant to several of Moddha's investors confrontedCOMPLAINT 8Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 9 of 27     PageID #: 9 Porrazzo and Sandor about Moddha's expired patent portfolio. Porrazzo and Sandoradmitted that Moddha's patent portfolio had expired.38. Moddha, Sandor, and Porrazzo's representations that Moddha heldenforceable intellectual property rights for its claimed technological innovation wereimportant to Moddha investors when they decided to invest their money in Moddha'sunregistered securities. The purported QT technology was central to the company'sbusiness, and without patent protection for that technology and the products whichembodied it, Moddha would not be able to commercially profit from it.2. Lies About Moddha's Ability to Buyback ""Share Dividends""39. Since at least 2015, when offering Moddha securities, Sandor andPorrazzo communicated to investors and potential investors that Moddha was a safeinvestment because they would at least get all of their invested capital back throughModdha's ""founder's"" share program.40. Sandor and Porrazzo represented that if investors purchased Moddha'ssecurities within a limited window of time, investors would receive ""founder's""shares that provided an automatic share dividend equal to the amount invested; inother words, a ""two for one"" deal. For example, a purchase of 100 ""founder's"" shareswould entitle the investor to an immediate dividend of another 100 shares.41. Sandor and Porrazzo also told investors that Moddha was on the cusp ofreceiving a large infusion of capital that would allow the company to buy back thedividend shares, thereby returning the investor's capital while still giving them theability to participate in future gains.42. In 2015, Porrazzo and Sandor claimed that this impending infusion ofcapital was going to come from a wealthy investor who would put $ 150 million intoModdha.43. In one case, in or about 2015, Sandor showed an investor an email thatpurportedly confirmed another person's commitment to transfer $150 million toModdha.COMPLAINT 9Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 10 of 27     PageID #: 10 44. As time passed, however, and the investor questioned Porrazzo andSandor about when the capital infusion would in fact occur, Sandor provided thatinvestor with increasingly absurd explanations for the delay.45. Sandor claimed first, that the $150 million investor was sick, and thenthat he was delayed by a shooting at a foreign embassy, and finally that the $150million payment was held up because the investor's flight had been grounded by theeruption of an Icelandic volcano.46. In the end, the purported $ 150 million cash infusion never came, andModdha never returned the inquiring investor's funds.47. More recently, Sandor and Porrazzo have told investors that thecompany would be able to buy back investors' dividend shares with revenues from itscommercial relationship with the Global Telecommunications Firm.48. As just one example, Porrazzo and Sandor met in October 2017 with twopotential investors who owned a local business in Hawaii.49. After demonstrating Moddha's purported Q-Tablet and claiming that theproduct had been patented, Sandor also provided the potential investors with aPowerPoint presentation that prominently featured the Global TelecommunicationsFirm's trademark logo throughout, which was entitled ""[Global TelecommunicationsFirm] Business Case for Moddha Spatial 3D Q-Tablet & Software Apps.""50. In her transmitting email, Sandor told the potential investors that:As I mentioned, we have just become a registered supplier with[Global Telecommunications Firm]. I have included our veryCONFIDENTIAL MODDHA - [GLOBALTELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRM] Deck. (Please do notdistribute). It is only 7 slides and encapsulates much and willexplain the products we will be bringing to the market. :)51. Every slide of the PowerPoint presentation Sandor sent contained theGlobal Telecommunications Firm's trademark, and the presentation stressed amongother things that, ""[Global Telecommunications Firm] profits from the $113 billionCOMPLAINT 10Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 11 of 27     PageID #: 11 3D Display market, selling exclusive Moddha S3D Tablets.""52. The husband and wife business owners subsequently invested $500,000in exchange for 5,000 of the company's supposed ""founder's"" shares. Like otherinvestors, the couple were told by Sandor and Porrazzo that they would be receiving ashare dividend of another 5,000 shares, which they could quickly redeem withModdha through a share buyback, thus recouping their $500,000 capital investmentwhile still holding on to their original 5,000 shares of Moddha stock.53. In a November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor again touted thecompany's supposed dividend share buyback program: ""MODDHA intends to offera full cash redemption of your MODDHA Dividend Share Certificates at the issueprice the dividend was made equaling $100 per share ... To our knowledge and byour research, MODDHA is the only Private Company in history, who will have everprovided a 100% return dividend, and we are excited to blaze the trail for othercompanies to follow.""54. In this same November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor repeated theclaim that Moddha was ""now a Registered Supplier to [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm]"" and also included the same PowerPoint presentationcontaining the Global Telecommunications Firm's trademark.55. The November 3, 2017 shareholder update also included new claims that""the powerpoint [sic] ... was circulated amongst the higher ups of [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm] and received a resounding unanimous vote to partner withMODDHA. [The Global Telecommunications Firm] has requested to sell MODDHAproducts in all [the Global Telecommunications Firm's] Stores Nationwide. There isa desire from [the Global Telecommunications Firm] to co-brand the Q-Tablet andQuartz headset. We are considering the request.""56. Months later, after their share redemption still had not occurred, thehusband and wife Moddha investors received a January 2018 email from Sandorattempting to explain the delay:COMPLAINT 11Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 12 of 27     PageID #: 12 Greetings and Aloha MODDHA Shareholders ... This is a quicknote to let you know that our executive team, Fsicl were all downand offline for the past 5 weeks with this horrible high feverbronchial flu. Fortunately, we have all recovered and despite nothaving any holiday at all, nor any Christmas, nor New Year'scelebration with our families, we have made it through and aretoday back to work.We have been advised that there were some remaining ...documents required to be executed with [Moddha's transferagent.] We are now executing those documents so that [thetransfer agent] can be fully empowered ... and provide therequired services for your share dividend redemption ... Althoughit was out of our control that our whole team came down with thisviolent influenza at such a critical moment, we wish to apologizeto each of you, for any hardship this delay, and/or our being out oftouch has caused to you.57. Then in April 2018, Sandor sent another shareholder update claimingthat the share buyback was merely awaiting ""final approval from securities counsel.""58. Despite Sandor's promises, Moddha has never redeemed the husbandand wife's ""founder's"" shares. The company has not returned any portion of the$500,000 they invested in the company last fall.59. Sandor and Porrazzo have never told investors that Moddha didn't havethe financial wherewithal to make a share buyback or that the claimed relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm was categorically false.60. From January 2017 to April 2018, the daily ledger balance on Moddha'sbank account has never exceeded $200,000.61. Moddha is not a ""Registered Supplier"" of the GlobalTelecommunications Firm.62. The Global Telecommunications Firm never authorized Moddha to useits name or trademark in connection with Moddha's solicitation of investors, or forany other purpose.COMPLAINT 12Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 13 of 27     PageID #: 13 63. The Global Telecommunications Firm has never asked to sell Moddhaproducts in any of its stores.64. Moddha has not received a single dollar in sales, licensing, or otherrevenue from the Global Telecommunications Firm.65. Moddha's, Sandor's, and Porrazzo's representations that investors wouldbe able to quickly recoup their invested capital, while still maintaining an equity stakein Moddha going forward, were important to Moddha investors. Moddha, Sandor,and Porrazzo's claims that the dividend share buyback would be paid for by,alternatively, an impending $ 150 million transfer from an individual investor, orrevenues generated through Moddha's commercial relationship with the GlobalTelecommunications Firm, were likewise significant to investors' decision to invest.That is because these false statements went to a fundamental feature of theinvestment Š the safety of the investment and whether Moddha investors wereguaranteed to at least the return of their invested capital.3. Misrepresentations About How Investor Funds Would Be Used66. Sandor and Porrazzo are the only signatories on Moddha's corporatebank accounts.67. Moddha's PPM contains a detailed description and table stating thatfunds raised from investors would be used on specific business-related costs.68. Among other things, the PPM stated that funds were to be used to ""buildand install the dedicated servers for the global network, to produce the Q-ConnectSmart Phone and Q-Tablet, to manufacture the ready prototype products, [and] todevelop and integrate the Wave Screen interface onto the QT products.""69. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo made specific representations toinvestors in personal meetings about how their investments would be used.70. For example, one investor was told, in or about summer 2015, thatModdha specifically needed the funds for manufacturing its Q-Tablet in China.71. Other investors understood from Porrazzo and Sandor that the moneyCOMPLAINT 13Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 14 of 27     PageID #: 14 they invested would be used by Moddha for its business, rather than for Porrazzo'sand Sandor's personal expenses.72. These representations concerning how Moddha, Porrazzo, and Sandorwould use money raised from the company's investors were false. Of theapproximately $827,025 in investor funds raised from January 2017 to April 2018,for instance, the majority of that money was diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo for theirpersonal use or to co-defendant Street as commissions.73. The following chart shows how the $827,025 of investor money wasdiverted to Sandor, Porrazzo and Street:n-Tvpe^ExpenseNet Transfers to Sandor's and Porrazzo's personalaccounts, including transfer to overseas account$221,373Commission payments to Spar Street, the sales agent$104,835Travel (including airfare, Airbnb, and hotels)$51,227Auto (including lease, service, and fuel)$15,372Retail (including grocery, liquor, and departmentstores)$13,830Restaurants$7,461ATM cash withdrawals$3,953Sandor and Porrazzo's charity in Kenya$2,200Percentage of Investor FundsŁ 51%74. Included in these funds diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo were amountsspent at retailers of products that have no evident business purpose, such as TheHome Depot, Liquor Barn, Target, and Walgreens.75. One egregious example occurred from November 19 to 26, 2017 duringThanksgiving week. In that week, Sandor and Porrazzo used Moddha investor fundsto stay at a luxury hotel in Santa Monica, California, where they spent upwards ofCOMPLAINT14Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 15 of 27     PageID #: 15 $2,400 a night on a room and purchased hundreds of dollars of food, drink, and spatreatments, including a $425 bottle of wine. All told, Sandor and Porrazzo's seven-night stay at the hotel was paid for with $15,884.01 in investor funds.76. In the same vein, on May 3, 2017, a Moddha investor transferred$50,000 to the company. Sandor and Porrazzo immediately misappropriated thesefunds, transferring $20,000 of that amount to Porrazzo's bank account the same day.77. And in the most recent set of corporate bank records obtained during theSEC's pre-filing investigation, Moddha's beginning account balance on April 1, 2018had dwindled to $6,036.91. On April 3, 2018, a Moddha investor transferred $50,000to the company. Once again, Sandor and Porrazzo quickly caused $10,000 ininvestor funds to be diverted to their personal and joint bank accounts, on the verysame day those investor funds first came in to Moddha's corporate account.78. In addition to these personal transfers, Sandor and Porrazzo spent$182,964 to satisfy two legal judgments against Moddha from January 2017 to April2018.79. In that time period, there is no indication in Moddha's bank records thatinvestor funds were used to manufacture QT products.80. Investors would have wanted to know that money raised by Moddha'sstock offering would not be used for working capital, as stated in the PPM, andinstead be diverted to Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street.C. The Scheme to Defraud Investors81. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated investor money bytransferring funds from Moddha's corporate account, for which Sandor and Porrazzowere the only two signatories, for their personal use.82. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo also gave potential and current investorsthe false appearance that Moddha's business was real, and that its supposed QTtechnology had already been incorporated into tangible and innovative products.83. Their artifice was simple, yet effective: Sandor and PorrazzoCOMPLAINT 15Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 16 of 27     PageID #: 16 demonstrated products in meetings with investors, including the Q-Tablet featured inthe company's offering materials, when in fact the products they showed investorswere made by unrelated companies and did not incorporate any of Moddha's claimedtechnology.84. In particular, the Q-Tablet - which did generate a 3D image that manypotential investors found impressive - used by Sandor and Porrazzo for productdemonstrations was instead designed and manufactured by a wholly-unrelated third-party technology company. In 2017, Sandor admitted to an investor consultant thatanother company owned and had developed the tablet used in Moddha'sdemonstrations, but insisted that Moddha owned 51 % of that other company. Whenpressed for documentation of Moddha's ownership, Sandor changed her story andsaid that the demonstration tablet had really been manufactured by a San FranciscoBay Area company that she refused to identify.85. Similarly, Moddha's offering materials contained images of otherproducts supposedly being developed by Moddha, including ""wearable technology,""""bone induction headphones,"" and a QT-powered speaker. Those images, though,were faked - the photos were of other companies' products that had been altered toappear as if they had been developed by Moddha.86. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo showed investors pre-produced videosthat purported to show Moddha's products working as claimed, but when an investorconsultant asked them to reproduce those results in a real-life setting, Sandor andPorrazzo refused to do so.87.

81,81,"On July 10, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former research and development scientist at a California biotech company with insider trading in advance of three positive company announcements.

According to the SEC's complaint, former company scientist Gene Shen had access to material nonpublic information concerning Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.'s progress towards meeting product development milestones related to a new genetic sequencing platform. Achievement of the milestones entitled the company to significant payments under a product development agreement. Shen allegedly used this confidential information to illegally profit by purchasing shares in advance of three announcements concerning the achievement of those milestones. The SEC alleges that Shen's purchases took place during company blackout periods and in brokerage accounts that were not at the company's designated brokerage firm - both of which were expressly prohibited by the company's insider trading policy. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Shen shared material nonpublic information before the third announcement with a relative, with the intention that the relative trade and benefit from the trading. The relative purchased company shares one day before the announcement.

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Northern District of California, charges Shen with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction along with the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty. Shen agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Shen agreed to pay a total of $88,192, consisting of disgorgement of $40,622 plus prejudgment interest of $4,228, and a penalty of $43,342. Shen also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ian Dattner with the assistance of the Office of Market Intelligence, under the supervision of Lisa Deitch and Antonia Chion. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," 12345b78s10111213141S16L71$192021222324252627IAN R.

82,82,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the former CEO of a New Jersey-based payment processing company and his romantic partner, in an insider trading scheme that leveraged nonpublic information about an impending merger announcement to generate more than $250,000 of illicit profits for the defendants.

According to the SEC's complaint, Robert O. Carr provided his longtime girlfriend, Katherine M. Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. by another payment processing company. In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock. The SEC alleges that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock. After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock. Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges Carr and Hanratty with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The SEC's complaint further seeks to bar Carr from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-reporting company.

The SEC's case is being handled by Xinyue Angela Lin, Deena Bernstein, and Paul G. Block of the Boston Regional Office.

 and 
Hanratty
, a Connecticut resident,
 in the sha
res of 
Heartland Payment Systems

its 
December 15, 2016 
announcement
 that 
it was to be acquired by 
Georgia
-based 
Global Payments, Inc
. (ﬁGlobalﬂ)
.  Carr, then the 
Chief 
Executive Officer (ﬁCEOﬂ)
 of Heartland, tipped Hanratty, his romantic partner, to material, 
nonpublic inform
ation
 that was expected to 
Œ and did 
Œ dramatically increase the value of 
Heartland™s stock.  Specifically, Carr tipped Hanratty
 concerning the acquisition of Heartland by 
Global, and Hanratty purchased Heartland stock while in possession of
, and on the ba
sis of
, that 
material, nonpublic information provided by Carr.
 2. Carr
, as the CEO 
of Heartland, was intimately involved in the negotiations 
from 
October to December 2015 
that led to his company™s acquisition by Global.  
Carr shared 
material, nonpublic inform
ation about the 
potential 
acquisition of Heartland by Global 
with 
Hanratty 
at various times during this period
.  For example, 
on or before November 9, 2015, 
Carr 
Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 1 of 13 2  revealed
 to Hanratty that he would be meeting with the CEO of Global on November 9, 2015
, to 
discuss the potential 
acquisition
 of Heartland by Global.  That same day, after Carr™s meeting 
with the Global CEO had concluded, Carr sent an email to Hanratty and told her 
on that Global 
had offered to 
acquire
 Heartland for a
 premium per 
share of Heartlan
d™s stock, and told Hanratty 
that the acquisition of Heart
land would be completed by mid
-December 2015.  Thereafter, o
n November 
15, 2016, Carr provided Hanratty a check for $1 million and instructed her to 
use that 
money to 
open a brokerage account and pu
rchase $900,000 worth of Heartland stock.  Hanratty 
acquired the 
Heartland 
securities as 
instructed
 by Carr
, completing the 
purchases of Heartland 
stock 
weeks prior to the news of the acquisition 
of Heartland by Global 
became public in 
December 2015.  
 The
 acquisition of Heartland by Global caused Heartland™s stock price to 
significantly increase, and Hanratty eventually sold the stock for a profit of over $250,000. 
 3. By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, 
Carr and 
Hanratty violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange

also occasionally accompanied Carr on business trips and he 
routinely 
confided to her
 regarding 
his work.  Hanratty was also in frequent communication with 
Carr™s
 family and friends.
 11. Over time
, Hanratty 
repeatedly 
expressed concern to Carr regarding her financial 
security.  
In March of 2015, while on vacation 
together 
in Mexico, Carr offered to give 
Hanratty 
some money for her financial security.  Hanratty rejected 
Carr™s 
offer
 at the time

a topic of conversation
 between them at least through the end of 2015
. B. Carr Provide
d Hanratty with Material Nonpubl

 12. On 
or about 
October 15, 2015, while attending 
a conference
, the CEO of Global 
approached Carr 
to request
 a meeting to discuss 
Global™s 
potential acquisition of Heartland.  
 13. On or about Novem
ber 9
, 2015, Carr and Global™s CEO met in person 
in Atlanta
, Georgia, 
to discuss the possibility of a strategic combination
 between Heartland and Global
.  On 
the morning of November 9, 2015, Hanratty emailed Carr stating
: ﬁHave a good meeting with 
Global!
ﬂ   14.  Later 
on November
 9, 2015
, Carr emailed Hanratty regarding the progress of the 
negotiation
s, stating
 that 
the 
meeting with the Global CEO had been ﬁgoodﬂ and that the 
offer 
price was $97.50
 per share of Heartland stock
, a premium to the then current 
trading price
.  In 
the email 
Carr 
also informed Hanratty that he thought 
the proposed acquisition of Heartland
 would close in mid
-December
 2015.  She replied
 in a return email
: ﬁWow quite an offer.ﬂ 
 Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 4 of 13 5  15. On November 10, 2015, at a regularly sched
uled Heartland
 board of d
irectors 
meeting
, Carr informed the board of the discuss
ions with the G
lobal 
CEO 
regarding a merger 
and received authorization to continue the discussions.  
  16. Subsequent
ly, during the afternoon of November 10, 2015, 
Carr discussed 
with 
Heartland
™s investment advisors 
a potential script for a 
phone 
call with Global™s CEO
, planned 
for 
at 9:30 am on November 11, 201
5.  Among the topics identified in the script were the 
following: 1) 
Heartland board™s interest in Global potentially acquiring Heartlan
d; 2) the need 
that the offer would have to be in the $100 per share range (a 30% premium
 over the current 
price per share of Heartland stock
); and 3) time and certainty was a 
necessity
 so Heartland 
wanted a deal before Christmas.  
 17. Later that day Hanratty
 email
ed Carr hoping that the board of directors 
meeting 
was ﬁgood.ﬂ 
 Carr responded 
via email 
that the board of directors meeting 
had been good
.  Hanratty 
in turn 
responded 
via email 
that she was ﬁ[g]lad it went well.ﬂ 
 18. On November 11, 201
5, Carr spoke 
by telephone 
with Global™s CEO.  
After the 
phone call
, Global™s CEO emailed Carr indicating that he had spoken to Global™s Chairman of 
the Board and wanted to meet on Friday, November 20, 201
5 in Toronto, Canada 
to continue 
discussions.  Global™s CEO infor
med Carr that he was bringing Global™s 
Chief Financial Officer 
(ﬁCFO
ﬂ) and President to the meeting.  Finally, Global™s CEO requested that Carr bring 
Heartland™s CFO
 and 
its President of the Strategic Markets Group
. 19. By November 13, 201
5, in preparation for
 the 
planned November 20, 2015, 
meeting with Global, 
Heartland™s investment banking firm had provided an analysis to Carr to 
determine the implications of a 
potential acquisition of Heartland by Global
, including its effects 
on Global going forward.
 Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 5 of 13 6  20. On 
or about 
November 1
5, 2015, Carr provided Hanratty with a check 
drawn 
from 
his personal checking account 
dated November 16, 2015 
for 
$1 million.
  Carr wrote ﬁloanﬂ 
in the memo section of the check.
 21. Later on November 15, 2015
, Hanratty emailed herself a 
to-do list that included 
ﬁHPY
,ﬂ the 
stock 
ticker symbol for Heartland
, and conducted internet searches on how to buy 
stock. 
 22. On 
November 17, 
2015, Hanratty 
went to her local bank branch and 
deposited
 the 
$1 million check
 into her checking account
.  During 
that visit she inquired 
of the bank manager 
as to how to open a brokerage account.  
 23. On November 17, 2015, 
Hanratty emailed Carr and stated that she 
had 
made 
arrangements to ﬁpurchase the HPY [Heartland] stock as soon as the out of state check clears.ﬂ  
In her email she also informed Carr that ﬁI am following your advice to the letter and keeping the 
amount you 
suggested in a saving 
[sic] 
account for now.
ﬂ 24. On November 1
8, 2015, Hanratty opened a brokerage account 
with a broker
-dealer firm that she was refer
red to by 
her local bank 
and then 
wrote a check to the brokerage 
firm for $900,000 to fund the account.  
She stated in her 
brokerage 
account opening paperwork 
that she owned no securities as of the opening of the 
brokerage 
account.
  In her 
brokerage 
accoun
t opening paperwork, 
Hanratty
 also 
stated that the source of her funds was a ﬁgiftﬂ and 
she listed Carr as the beneficiary of the 
brokerage 
account upon her death.
  In fact, while 
in the 
midst of opening her brokerage account
, Hanratty emailed Carr requesting his social security 
number to allow her to 
name 
him
 as a beneficiary
.   Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 6 of 13 7  25. In communications with her broker while opening the 
brokerage 
account, 
Hanratty stated that she felt obligated to purchase Heartland stock because sh
e received the 
gifted money from the owner of the company.
 26.  Later 
on November 18
, 2015, Hanratty 
emailed
 Carr that she had become a 
shareholder
 of Heartland
.  In a reply email, 
Carr thanked Hanratty for the purchase
.  In her 
subsequent 
email 
reply 
to Carr,
 Hanratty informed Carr that she had purchased 8
,500 shares 
of 
Heartland stock 
and intended to obtain
 additional shares the next day.
   27. On November 18, 201
5, Hanratty purchased 8
,500 shares
 of Heartland stock
 at 
$78.84 per share
.  On November 19, 2015, she
 bought an additional 
2,500 shares at $78.88
 per 
share
.  Finally on November 23, 201
5, she purchased an additional 393 shares
 for
 $79.49 per 
share
.  In total, 
between November 18, 2015, and November 23, 201
5, Hanratty purchased 
11,393 shares of Heartland s
tock for $899,852 for an
 average cost of $78.98 
per 
share
. 28. In the midst of Hanratty™s purchases of Heartland shares, on 
November 19, 2015, 
after a conversation between Carr and the Global CEO
, the two companies entered into a mutual 
confidentiality agreement
 Œ an agreement by the companies to keep information confidential 
during Global™s 
due diligence 
of Heartland™s 
financial 
condition prior to an acquisition.
   29. On November 20, 2015 the Heartla
nd and Global management teams met so that 
Global could start 
its 
due diligence 
investigation
, a common business practice that, in this 
situation, would involve one company taking steps to research and analyze another company it is 
considering acquiring
.   30. On November 21, 
2015, during a trip to Chicago for 
Carr™s 
70th birthday party 
with Hanratty
 and members of Carr™s family
, Carr announced to his children and their spouses 
that an Atlanta
-based company named Global had offered to buy Heartland and that he 
would 
Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 7 of 13 8  not sell 
Heartland to Global 
unless the offer had a ﬁ1ﬂ in the price, implying that he wanted 
at 
least 
$100 per 
share.  
 31. On November 23, 2015, 
Hanratty emailed Carr to express her gratitude and stated 
ﬁfor the first time ever I feel a sense of relief
 knowing that I have some security.ﬂ  Referring to 
the 
$1 million
, Hanratty repeated that ﬁI have done exactly what you recommended I do with it 
and made you the beneficiary of the account.ﬂ 
 Carr replied 
via email 
that he was glad that she 
was not so stre
ssed anymore.
 32. On November 24, 2015, Global sent a preliminary letter proposal 
to Heartland 
offering $97.50 per share to acquire Heartland, the same 
price
 in Carr™s email to Hanratty two
-weeks earlier.  
 33. Negotiations 
between Heartland and Global 
continued a
nd on December 10, 
2015, multiple news organizations publicly reported that the two companies were negotiating an 
acquisition and that a deal was likely.  
 34. On that day, after the news reports
, Heartland™s stock price increased by $6.95 per 
share (8.93%) to
 close at $84.79 per share.  
Although the news reports did not reveal any pricing 
or deal terms, 
Heartland and Global
 nevertheless decided to accelerate 
the acquisition 
discussions as a result of the reports.
 35. Between December 12 and December 14, 
2015, Hanr
atty repeatedly emailed Carr 
about his ﬁcrazy 
busyﬂ preparations at Heartland
.  On December 13, Carr emailed Hanratty his 
draft quote to be used for the press release of the pending acquisition.  Just minutes later, she 
replied ﬁlove itﬂ and provided a sug
gestion for the draft quote.
 36. On December 15, 2015, 
after the 
close 
of trading
 of the securities markets
, Heartland and Global
 announced that they had entered into a
 merger agreement whereby Global 
Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 8 of 13 9  would acquire Heartland 
in a cash
-and
-stock tra
nsaction for $100.00 per share.  The public 
announcement prompted 
Heartland™s 
stock 
price 
to increase 
by $
9.87 (11%)
 per share
 to a price 
of 
$94.97 per share
 by the close of markets the next day
. 37. Hanratty held on to her Heartland stock and on January 28, 
2016, she emailed her 
broker stating that Carr had decided to resign from Heartland and she planned to sell her stock
. 38.  On April 11, 2016, Hanratty emailed Carr asking for his guidance on when she 
should sell the Heartland stock
.  The very next day, Carr 
emailed
 Hanratty that he saw ﬁno 
reason at allﬂ why she should not sell that day as the stock ha
d risen to $101.37 per share.  
Hanratty then 
emailed
 Carr
 that she 
would
 sell all of her Heartland stock that day.  
 39. The next day, Hanratty 
emailed
 Carr again
, stating that she sold her stock 
according to Carr™s instructions.  Hanratty 
sold her 11,393 shares of Heartland at $101.066 
per 
share
, for 
a profit of 
$250,628
 when compared to the prices at which she bought the stock in 
November 2015
.   C. Carr
 Violated His 
Duty to Heartland by Tipping Hanratty as to Material, 
Nonpublic Information
. 40. Heartland™s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
 (ﬁthe Codeﬂ) explicitly 
prohibited all employees from trading in securities or other types of property based on 
knowledge derived from their employment.  The Code stated that ﬁ[i]t is also illegal to give tips 
to others which
 [sic] allow them to trade sec
urities and property using such ‚insider 
information.
™ﬂ  We follow these law
s strictly and without exception.ﬂ  Finally, the Code required
 Carr
 to read carefully ﬁHeartland™s Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securitiesﬂ (
ﬁInsider 
Trading Policy
ﬂ). 
 41. The 
Insider Trading Policy
 specifically stated that no officer ﬁwho is aware of 
material nonpublic information relating to [Heartland] may (a) buy or sell securities of the 
Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 9 of 13 10  Company –or engage in any other action to take personal advantage of that information, 
or (b) 
pass that information on to others outside the Company including family, friends, and 
acquaintances
.ﬂ 42. The Insider Trading 
policy provided detail
ed examples of material 
nonpublic 
information including ﬁ[a] pending or proposed merger, acquisition, ten
der offer or other 
corporate consolidation or restructuring transaction.ﬂ
  Further, the policy warned that the 
Commission has successfully prosecuted cases against employees ﬁtrading by family members 
and friends.ﬂ
 43. Carr, as the CEO of Heartland, was subjec
t to its insider trading policy.  
On 
information and belief
, Carr 
was required 
to certify in writing 
that he had read and complied with 
the policy
 on a 
regular
 basis
.   44. Information regarding Global™s potential acquisition of Heartland, which Carr 
obtained as 
a result of his employment as 
CEO of Heartland
, was not publicly disseminated prior 
to December 10, 2015 news reports.  In fact, both Heartland and Global had mutuall
y agreed to 
keep the information strictly confidential.  
 45. The information 
regarding the potential 
acquisition of Heartland by Global
 was 
material.  A reasonable investor would have viewed this information as being important to his or 
her investment decisio
n or a significant alteration of the total mix of information made available 
to the public about 
Heartland
™s stock
. 46. By providing Hanratty the 
material, nonpublic 
information 
about the potential 
acquisition of Heartland 
and 
the 
funding to trade Heartland™s 
stock, Carr violated the company™s 
Code, which ﬁstrictlyﬂ prohibited giving ﬁtips to others which allow them to trade securities and 
Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 10 of 13 11  property using 
– ‚insider information.™ﬂ 
More generally
, Carr
 breached his duty to the 
shareholders of Heartland.  
 47. Carr kn
ew or recklessly disregarded that 
tipping Hanratty
 was in breach of a 
fiduciary duty 
he owed 
to 
Heartland
 and its shareholders.

 and incorp
orates by reference the allegations 
in 
paragraphs 
1 through
 47 above.
 49. The information described in 
the Complaint 
was material and nonpublic and

considered by Heartland to be confidential.  Heartland had policies and procedures protecting 
confidential 
information.
 50. Carr learned of the material nonpublic information described

Heartland
 and had an obligation to protect the

. 51. Carr tipped Hanratty to trade in the stock of Heartland based on the material 
nonpublic information

and its shareholders 
when she traded in the stock of Heartland while in the possession of material 
nonpublic information.  
 53. As alleged herein,

83,83,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a registered broker-dealer, agreed to settle charges that it failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on the suspicious transactions of independent investment advisers that it terminated from using Schwab to custody their client accounts.

To help detect potential violations of the securities laws, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to report suspicious transactions that occur through their firms. The SEC's complaint alleges that in 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated 83 independent investment advisers for engaging in activity that Schwab determined violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers. The complaint further alleges that at least 47 of the terminated advisers engaged in transactions through Schwab that it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect were suspicious and required the filing of a SAR. Schwab failed to file SARs on the suspicious transactions of 37 of these terminated advisers. Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had engaged in a range of suspicious transactions not involving the outright misappropriation or misuse of client funds, including: (1) transactions involving possible undisclosed self-dealing or conflicts of interest; (2) charging client accounts excessive advisory fees; (3) potentially fraudulent transactions in client accounts; (4) posing as a client to effect or confirms transactions in the client account; and (5) executing client trades and/or collecting advisory fees without being properly registered as an adviser. Moreover, Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had misused client funds but the client had not complained.

The SEC's complaint charges Schwab with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Schwab has agreed to settle the action by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction and the payment of a $2.8 million civil penalty.","

SUMMARY 
3. In 2012 and 2013, 
Schwab 
violated 
Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 
17a
-8 by failing to file Suspicious Activity Reports (ﬁSARsﬂ) on suspicious 
transactions by independent investment advisers (ﬁAdvisersﬂ) that Schwab terminated 
from its custodial platform
. Schwab 
terminated the Advisers 
for engaging in activity 
Schwab 
determined violated its 
internal 
policies and 
presented risk to Schwab or its 
customers. 
4. Schwab™s failure to file 
the 
SARs 
at issue 
resulted from its 
inconsistent 
implement
ation 
of policies and procedures 
for identifying and reporting suspicious 
transaction
s under the SAR Rule (31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a))
.  Although Schwab 
investigate
d and 
terminat
ed 
the Advisers, it 
did not have clear or consistent policies 
and procedures regarding 
the types of transactions on 
which SARs needed to be filed
.  For example, Schwab did not file SARs in certain instances where it investigated and 
terminated 
Advisers for conduct that led
, or reasonably should have led
, Schwab 
to 
suspect 
that the Advisers 
had charged certain customers excessive advisory fees
, had 
allowed their state registrations to lapse
, or were 
engaged in 
schemes involving 
ﬁcherry-
pickingﬂ (a fraudulent trade allocation scheme where the Adviser allocates 

profitable trades to the Adviser™s personal account and unprofitable trades to client 

accounts).  In addition, in a number of 
instances 
where 
Schwab 
investigated and 
terminated Advisers for c
onduct that led, or reasonably should have led, it to suspect 
that the Advisers 
misappropriat
ed 
or misuse
d client funds, Schwab applied an 
unreasonably high standard for determining whether to file a SAR on the suspicious 

transactions.

THE ALLEGATIONS 
A. Schwab™s Investment Adviser Business and Terminations of Advisers 
6. Schwab, through its Advisor Services division, offers a broad range of 
products and services to Advisers and their clients. 
These Advisers are not employees 
of Schwab nor are they affiliated with the firm. They are independent third
-party 
advisers who ha
ve a separate fiduciary relationship with their clients, and contract with 
Schwab for custodial and execution services. Investment advisers are persons or firms 
that are engaged in the business of providing investment advice to others for 

compensation.  Investment advisers have to register with either the SEC or the state 
securities agency where they have their principal place of business, depending on the 
amount of client assets they manage. 
7. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, investment advisers 
have a 
broad fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their clients.  As fiduciaries, 

investment advisers must avoid conflicts of interest with their clients and are prohibited 

from overreaching or taking unfair advantage of their clients™ trust.  Among the 

obligations that flow from the investment advisers™ fiduciary duty include:  full and fair 

disclosure of all facts material to the clients™ engagement of the investment adviser and 

a duty to avoid misleading clients; the disclosure of all material facts regarding any 

actual or potential 
conflict of interest between the investment adviser and the client; 
and 
an obligation to 
provide only investment advice that is suitable for the client in 
light of the client™s financial situation, investment experi
ence, and investment 
objectives. 
8. In 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated its business relationship 
with 83 
Advisers that 
Schwab determined 
had 
violated its internal policies and presented risk to 
Schwab or its customers
.  The terminated Advisers had a combined total of $1.62 

billion in assets under management (ﬁ
AUM
ﬂ) 
and almost 18,000 subaccounts at

B. Schwab™s Failure to File SARs on the Suspicious Transactions of 
Terminated Advisers 
9. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (the ﬁBSAﬂ) (31 U.S.C. §§ 5311
-5330) and 
the SAR Rule (31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)), Schwab is required to file SARs with the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (ﬁFinCENﬂ) to report any transaction 

conducted or attempted by, at, or through Schwab that involved or aggregated funds of 
at least $5,000 
and that Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the 
transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part): 
a. 
involved funds derived from illegal activity; 
b. was designed to evade any requirements of the 
BSA 
or any 
regulations under the 
BSA
; c. 
had no business or apparent lawful purpose or was not the sort in 

which the particular customer would have normally been expected 

to engage, and Schwab knew of no reasonable explanation for the 

transaction after examining 
the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction; or 
d. involved the use of Schwab to facilitate criminal activity. 
10. Under 
Exchange Act 
Section 17(a) and Rule 17a
-8, Schwab is required to 
comply with the recordkeeping, 
retention, and reporting obligations of the BSA and its 
implementing regulations, including the SAR Rule.  Schwab™s failure to file a SAR is a 

violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a
-8. 
11. At least 47 of the 
83 terminated Advisers engaged in tra
nsactions of at least 
$5,000 that were conducted at, by, or through Schwab and that Schwab, knew, suspected, 

or had reason to suspect were suspicious under the SAR Rule.  Schwab, however, filed 

SARs relating to 
the suspicious transactions of 
only 10 of the 
terminated Advisers, and 
three 
of those SARs were filed after the SEC had brought an enforcement action against 
the Adviser.

12. Schwab failed to file SARs relating to the suspicious transactions of the 
remaining 37 
terminated Advisers.  These 37 
terminated 
Advisers were registered, or 
should have been registered, as investment advisers with either the SEC or a state 
securities agencies and combined 
had a total of over $840 million in AUM and at least 
6,500 subaccounts at Schwab. 
13. Schwab™s failure to file 
the 
SARs 
at issue 
resulted from its 
inconsistent 
implementation of 
policies and procedures 
for identifying and reporting 
transactions 
under the SAR Rule
. Schwab had a SAR policy that stated that it should file a SAR on 
any transaction of $5,000 or more that ﬁinvolves potential fraud.ﬂ  The policy further 

defined ﬁSecurities Fraudﬂ as a ﬁwide range of crimes whereby securities [were] used 

as an instrumentality in a scheme to defraud,ﬂ including ﬁmarket manipulation, making 

untrue statements in regard to specific securities, attempting to deceive another 
in 
connection with the purchase or sale of a security, and attempting to illicitly transact in 

unregistered or restricted securities.ﬂ 
14. Although Schwab 
did 
file SARs relating to the apparent theft of client 
funds by Advisers, Schwab failed to file SARs relating to other types of 
potentially 
illegal or fraudulent transactions by Advisers 
it terminated
.  For example, in various 
instances, 
Schwab failed to file SARs relating to transactions by Advisers that it 
suspected, or reasonably should have suspected, involved:  (1) an Adviser™s possible 
self
-dealing 
or conflict of interest through the suspicious transfer of funds from client 
accounts 
custodied at Schwab 
to 
accounts or investments affiliated with the Adviser; 
(2)
the Adviser™s use of Schwab™s management fee system to charge client accounts 
excessive 
advisory fees; (3) patterns of potentially fraudulent transactions in client 
accounts 
such as ﬁcherry
-pickingﬂ
; (4) Advisers who Schwab suspected 
were 
logging
-in or signing in the name of clients to effect or confirm transactions in client 
accounts; and (5) Advisers who 
had allowed their registrations to lapse 
but continued 
to execute client trades and/or collect advisory fees through Schwab. 
15. In addition, Schwab applied an unreasonably high standard for

determining whether to file a SAR on transactions it suspected or should have 
suspected involved possib
le 
misappropriation or other misuse 
of client funds
.  As alleged in paragraphs 1
8 and 
19 below, for example, Schwab did not file SARs where it 
suspected or had reason to suspect that the Adviser had misused client funds but the 

clients had not complained t
o Schwab about the transactions. 
16. As a result of Schwab™s failure to file the required SARs at issue
, the SEC 
and other regulatory or law enforcement agencies were not alerted to the Advisers™ 
suspicious transactions 
as required
. C. Examples of Schwab™s Failure to File SARs on the Suspicious Transactions 
of Terminated Advisers 
17. The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved 
the suspicious 
transfer of funds from client 
accounts custodied at 
Schwab to accounts or 
investments affiliated with the Adviser. 
18. 
For example, ﬁAdviser Aﬂ 
was a State
-registered Adviser with $14 million 
in AUM and 244 subaccounts at Schwab. In late 2013, Schwab 
learned that Adviser A 
had caused two clients to wire transfer a total of $295,000 from their Sch
wab accounts 
to an account controlled by Adviser A. Schwab also learned that shortly after the client 

funds were wired to Adviser A, Adviser A purchased a personal residence for himself. 

The clients confirmed to Schwab that they were aware of the wire 
transfers but could 
not say what the wire transfers were for. Adviser A told Schwab that he invested the 

clients in a private residential real estate investment trust but did not provide to Schwab 

the documents for the purported investment. Schwab then terminated Adviser A. 
19. 
Based on th
at information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to 
suspect that the $295,000 in wire transfers were suspicious under the SAR Rule and 

should have filed a SAR on them. 
Schwab, however, did not file the required SAR
. The memorandum 
closing 
Schwab™s 
investigation 
regarding 
Adviser A stated
, in part
, that 
ﬁ[i]
t is possible that [Adviser A] used the client™s funds for the purchase of his property 
but this fact can not be confirmed.  The wire transfers by the two clients w

researched.  Both clients were found to have verified and authorized the wire transfers 
on recorded lines.  This 
matter 
is being closed as nothing [was] found since neither 
client has complained or disputed the wire transfers 
[Adviser A].
ﬂ Given the 
information known to Schwab and Schwab™s termination of Adviser A based on that 
information, the standards requiring a SAR filing were met, and Schwab applied too 

high a standard by requiring that the misuse be ﬁconfirmedﬂ or that the clients 

complain. 
20. 
As another example, ﬁAdviser Bﬂ 
was 
an SEC
-registered Adviser with 
$92 million in AUM and 543 subaccounts at Schwab.  In 2013, Schwab terminated 

Adviser 
B after learning that three 
of its 
clients had each invested $100,000 in a private 
placement 
of securitie
s by Adviser 
B™s disclosed 
parent company.  Schwab found that 
the principal of both Adviser 
B and its parent company was apparently in poor 
financial condition because he had an outstanding federal tax lien and a recent $2 

million civil judgment against him relating to selling investment contracts in life 

insurance policies. 
21. 
Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to 
suspect that the $300,000 in investments were suspicious under the SAR Rule. Schwab 

therefore should have filed a SAR on the transactions.  Schwab, however, did not file 

the required SAR on the suspicious transactions. 
22. 
The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved 
Advisers using Schwab™s management fee system to charge client Schwab acco
unts suspicious advisory fees. 
Schwab, however, failed to file a SAR relating to the 
terminated Advisers™ suspicious fees because Schwab unreasonably believed that such 

transactions did not warrant SARs. 
23. 
For example, 
ﬁAdviser 
Cﬂ was a State
-registered Adviser with $6.7 
million in AUM and 150 subaccounts at Schwab.  Schwab terminated Adviser 
C for 
using Schwab™s management fee system to charge a client a suspicious $28,000 fee, 
which was up ﬁdramaticallyﬂ from previous quarterly fees of about $2,000.  Schwab

could not verify the fee based on the documentation provided by Adviser C. 
24. 
Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to 
suspect that Adviser 
C had misappropriated funds from the client through charging h
er an improper fee and that the fee was suspicious under the SAR Rule.  Schwab therefore 
should have filed a SAR on the transaction.  Schwab, however, did not file the required 

SAR on the suspicious fee because it unreasonably believed that such fees did n
ot warrant SAR filings. 
25. The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved 
transactions in client accounts that were part of suspected 
ﬁcherry
-pickingﬂ 
schemes to 
defraud their clients.  Schwab did not file SARs on the suspicious transactions of these 

Advisers because it unreasonably believed that such 
conduct 
did not require a SAR 
filing. 
26. For example, ﬁAdviser 
Dﬂ was an SEC
-registered Adviser with $50 
million in AUM and 476 subaccounts at Schwab.  Schwab found that in 2009 and 201
0, 
Adviser 
D appeared to 
allocate 
17 profitable day trades for itself for profits totaling 
about $75,000.  Schwab twice counseled Adviser 
D about the suspicious trading, 
including telling Adviser 
D that such 
apparent 
preferential trade allocation ﬁshould b
e of concern to [Adviser 
D] in the case of any audit conducted by the SEC or other 
regulatory agencies.ﬂ 
Schwab terminated Adviser D in 2012. 
27. Based on that information, from as early as 2009, Schwab knew, 
suspected, or had reason to suspect that Adviser D was engaging in a fraudulent 

cherry-
picking scheme and that the trading was suspicious under the SAR Rule. 

Schwab therefore should have filed a SAR on the trading.  Schwab, however, did not 

file the required SAR on the trading because it unreasonably believed that 
such 
apparent 
preferential trade allocation
s did not warrant a SAR filing. 
28. 
The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated 
Advisers involved 
Advisers whom Schwab suspected of posing as clients to effect or confirm transactions at 

Schwab.

29. 
For example, 
ﬁAdviser 
Eﬂ was a State
-registered Adviser with $17 million 
in AUM and 132 subaccounts at Schwab who did not have discretionary trading 
authority over 
its clients™ accounts.  Schwab terminated Adviser 
E after he admitted to 
Schwab that he used the username and password of 20 clients to log on to Schwab™s 

client web portal (rather than following Schwab™s rule that Advisers log onto the 

Adviser™s web portal using the Adviser™s username and password). Schwab trading 

records show that trades were made in certain of these client accounts. 
30. 
Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to 
suspect that Adviser 
E was 
posing as its clients to place trades.  Schwab therefore 
knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the transactions were suspicious under 

the SAR Rule and should have filed a SAR on the transactions.  Schwab, however, did 

not file the required SAR on 
Adviser 
E.  31. 
Finally, the suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers 
involved Advisers who were not properly registered as an 
Adviser but executed client 
trades and/or collected advisory fees through Schwab™s management fee system. 
32. 
For example, ﬁAdviser Fﬂ was an unregistered 
Adviser with $3 million in 
AUM and 78 subaccounts at Schwab.  Schwab terminated 
Adviser F after 
finding that 
Adviser F 
had not been registered 
as an 
Adviser 
for almost two years but had collected 
over $100,000 i
n fees through Schwab™s management fee system
. Similarly, ﬁAdviser 
Gﬂ had $14 million in AU
M and 11 subaccounts at Schwab.  When Adviser G™s 
registration as an Adviser lapsed with 
the 
Commission in mid
-December 2012, 
Schwab restricted Adviser G™s ability to charge client fees through Schwab™s 

management fee system.  Shortly thereafter, Adviser G requested Schwab to send it 

$40,375 in management fees from a client™s IRA account.  Schwab told Adviser G that 

it could not use Schwab™s management fee system 
bec
ause it was not registered and 
that it would have to collect the fees outside of Schwab. 
33. 
Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to 
suspect that Adviser F and Adviser G 
were 
engaging or attempting to engage in

suspicious tra

or attempted transactions of unregistered Adviser 
because it 
unreasonably believed that 
such 
suspicious tra

did not warrant a SAR filing.

As a result of this conduct, Schwab violated, and unless restrained and 
enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a
-8.

86,86,"This past week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former Equifax manager with insider trading in advance of the company’s September 2017 announcement of a massive data breach that exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of approximately 148 million U.S. customers. This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach. In March, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading.

In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.

According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach. The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options. Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.

Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company’s insider trading policy.

In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.

To settle the SEC’s civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries. The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia,Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

itself the victim
 of the breach.  Bonthu then traded against the company by

. STATEMENT OF FACTS
 I. THE 
EQUIFAX 
CYBERSECURITY 
BREACH
 12. On July 29, 2017, Equifax™s security
 department observed suspic
ious 
network traffic 
with
in an internal system
.  Over the next several weeks, 
it was 
determined that 
Equifax had been subject to
 cyber
-intrusions that resulted in 
a 
breach 
of Equifax™
s information technology (ﬁ
ITﬂ)
 system
s. 13. A cri
sis action team consisting of Equifax security, 
IT, and legal personnel 
was formed and 
began working
 to analyze forensic data and determine the scope of 
the intrusion.
  The 
analysis 
suggested
 it was likely that 
sensitive data, including 
personally 
identifiable information (ﬁPIIﬂ)
 for millions of consumers,
 had been 
stolen
. 14. Equifax 
established a notification and remediation plan for the millions of 
consumers affected by the breach.  Th
e company designated th
is 
effort
 as ﬁProjec
t Sparta
.ﬂ 15. Although the
 crisis action team members were aware that Equifax had been 
breached, the company made attempts to keep that information confidential
 from 
others
.  To limit the number of people who knew that Equifax itself had been 
Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 4 of 12 5  breached, the Equifax employees who wer
e part of Project Sparta were told that 
they were working for an unnamed potential client that had experienced a large 
data breach.
 16. Project Sparta
 was handled largely through the company™s 
GCS unit
, which 
developed and sold various personal security and id
entity theft defense products 
and services to clients.
 II. BONTHU
 IS 
ENTRUSTED WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT
 THE 
BREACH
  17. On August 25, 2017, Bonthu
, a software product development manager 
working in GCS, was assigned 
to work on a ﬁfast
-breaking opportunityﬂ for an 
unnamed potential client
 as a part of Project Sparta
. 18. Bonthu 
was told 
that the project was a high priority for the 
unnamed 
company
 and had 
a short deadline because the client intended to ﬁgo liveﬂ on 
Septembe
r 6, 2017
, with the breach remediation app
lications designed by Equifax.
 19. Bonthu 
was tasked 
with primary responsibility for developing an online user 
interface into which consumers could input information to determine whether they 
had been impacted by the b
reach.  Bonthu 
was 
also
 responsible for
 crea
ting
 an 
algorithm that would schedule consumers to return to Equifax™s website to register 
for identity protection tools.  
 Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 5 of 12 6  20. Between August 25 and August 31, 
2017, 
in connection with his work on 
Project Sparta, Bo
nthu received emails and participated in conversations that 
informed him that the breach impacted at least 100 million consumers 
Œ the largest 
breach opportunity Equifax ever
 had handled.
 21. In the course of his work, Bonthu also used test datasets that conta
ined the 
same types of PII that had been impacted by the breach, including first and last 
names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth
, and social security numbers.
 22. On August 31,
 2017,
 Bonthu was copied on an email that attached a t
est 
dataset file that
 was named 
ﬁEFXDatabreach.postman_collection.ﬂ
 III. BONTHU 
CONCLUDES 
THAT 
EQUIFAX WAS THE 
REAL 
VICTIM OF THE 
BREACH
  23. By no later than August 31
, 2017, 
based on
 material
 nonpublic information 
entrusted to hi
m by his employer, Equifax, Bonthu
 had 
concluded 
that Equifax 
itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach, despite the
 statements made 
as part of
 Project Sparta
 asserting that it was a business 
opportunity
 for an 
unnamed client.
 24. Bonthu
 owed a duty of trust and confidence to Equifax and its shar
eholders 
not to trade on the basis of material nonpublic information that he learned through 
his employment with Equifax, and
 was aware of his duty.
 Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 6 of 12 7  25. Bonthu
 knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that 
Equifax was the victim of a major cybe
rsecurity breach was material. 
 26. Bonthu
 knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that 
Equifax was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was nonpublic.
  IV. BONTHU
™S TRADING IN 
EQUIFAX 
SECURITIES
 27. On September 1, 2017, Bonthu 
accessed his
 family™s brokerage accounts on 
their broker™s website.  
 28. Bonthu 
had 
access to 
numerous
 family brokerage accounts, several of which 
were held in his own name and had cash available for new transactions.
 29. From the available
 account
s, however, 
Bonthu
 chose an account
 held
 solely 
in his wife™s name
. 30. In his wife™s account, Bonthu 
purchase
d eighty
-six
 out
-of-the
-money 
put option contracts for shares of Equifax common stock with an expiration date of 
September 15, 2017
, and a strike price of $130 per shar
e.  Bonthu made this 
purchase despite 
the fact that Equifax™s policies
 expressly prohibit any trading in 
derivative securities, including put and call options.
 31. By purchasing out
-of-the
-money put options, Bonthu could make money 
only 
if the 
market 
price of 
Equifax stock were to drop below the put option strike 
price before the contract expired approximately two weeks later, on September 15.  
Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 7 of 12 8  If the 
market 
price did not so drop, the put options would expire and his investment 
would be worthless.
 32. The strike pr
ice of $130 per share was
 more than $10 
below 
the price at 
which 
Equifax common stock traded on that day.
 33. The total price of the Equifax option contracts purchased by Bonthu
 on 
September 1 was $2,166.11.
 34. Bonthu had never previously trade
d in Equifax 
options
.   V. EQUIFAX 
TELLS THE 
PUBLIC ABOUT THE 
BREACH
, AND BONTHU 
SELLS HIS 
PUT 
OPTIONS
  35. After the close of the market on September 7, 2017, Equifax issued a press 
release and filed a Form 8
-K with the Commission, announcing the cybersecurity 
breach and 
revealing that it potentially impacted approximately 143 million 
consumers in the United States.
 36. The breach was one of the leading news stories over the next several days 
and was described as ﬁone of the worst [data breaches] ever, by its reach and by the 
kind of inform
ation exposed to the public.ﬂ
 37. On September 8, the price of Equifax common stock closed at $123.23, a 
drop of $19.49
 (nearly 14
%) per share from the prior day™s closing price of 
$142.72.  Trading volume that day also increased dramatically to 
nearly seventeen 
Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 8 of 12 9  million shares, more than a thirty
-fold increase from the previous day™s volume o
f approximately 518,000 shares.
 38. Also o
n the morning of September 8,
 and despite Equifax™s 
policies 
expressly
 forbidding transactions in derivative securities,
 Bonthu sold all of his 
Equifax put option contracts.  As a result of the precipitous drop in Equifax™s share 
price, Bonthu turned his initial investment of $2,166.11 into $77,333.79 in only six 
days.  In sum, Bonthu™s ill
-gotten gains from his trading in 
Equifax options totaled 
$75,167.68
, a return of more than 3,500% on his initial investment
.   39. Bonthu™s 
securities transactions were made on the basis of material 
nonpublic information and breached the duty of trust and confidence that 
he 
owed 
to Equifax an
d its shareholders
.  Bonthu knew or was reckless in not knowing that 
the information that Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach 
was material and nonpublic, and Bonthu used that information when making these 
securities transactions. 
  40. Bonthu™s trading on the basis of material nonpublic information entrusted to 
him by Equifax was deceptive and fraudulent.

 Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 12 of 12"
87,87,"On June 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a California-based telecommunications equipment manufacturer, its Chief Financial Officer, Former Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Contract Fulfillment and Sales Operations for inflating reported revenues in the company's Middle East, Africa, and Europe region in the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013.

According to the SEC's complaint, Axesstel, Inc., Chief Financial Officer Patrick J. Gray, and former Chief Executive Officer Harold Clark Hickock III, aided and abetted by Director of Contract Fulfillment and Sales Operations Steven R. Sabin, inflated the company's revenues by prematurely recognizing revenue on sales and by improperly recognizing revenue despite entering into undisclosed side agreements that relieved customers of payment obligations. Additionally according to the complaint, the Defendants inflated unit prices of products to hit revenue targets with the agreement that Axesstel would subsequently repay the inflated amounts to the customer as marketing development fees. The SEC alleges that Axesstel's revenue was overstated by 66% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 38% in the first quarter of 2013.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Axesstel, Gray and Hickock violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Sabin aided and abetted these violations. The complaint also alleges that Gray and Sabin circumvented internal accounting controls and falsified Axesstel's books and records in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; that Axesstel violated the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and that Gray, Hickock and Sabin aided and abetted Axesstel's violations of 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 while Gray aided and abetted Axesstel's violations of Rule 13a-11; that Axesstel violated the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and that Gray and Hickock aided and abetted these violations; and that by signing false Sarbanes-Oxley certifications and lying to Axesstel's auditor, Gray and Hickock violated Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2.

Axesstel, Gray, Hickock and Sabin agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint and consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders Gray, Hickock and Sabin to pay penalties of $40,000, $25,000 and $10,000, respectively. Gray and Hickock also consented to entry of a judgment which permanently bars Hickock from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and bars Gray from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlements are subject to court approval.

Gray also consented to the issuance of a Commission Order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Adam B. Gottlieb and supervised by Amy L. Friedman, with the assistance of trial counsel Suzanne J. Romajas and Christian D. H. Schultz, supervised by Jan M.

  Œ including price
, delivery,
 and payment terms
 Œ were not 
finalized before the end of the 
period in which
 Axesstel recognized the 
revenue
, and unit 
sales 
prices were
 routinely
 inflated to enable Axesstel to hit revenue targets
.  These 
sales 
terms were 
reflected in 
fake purchase orders 
prepared by 
company executives 
and internally 
referred to as 
ﬁholding POs.
ﬂ  Axesstel also entered into u

did not 
actually owe.
  Further
, Axesstel™s 
CFO 
and 
CEO 
signed quarterly management 
representation letters to Axesstel™s auditor that failed to disclose the true facts and 
circumstances of these purported sales.

many of the improperly recorded 
sales were never finalized, and 
Axesstel™s customers refused to accept the product
s they purportedly had ordered
, or they 
accepted the products in lower quantities
 than 
was 
reflected 
 in the ﬁholding POs.ﬂ

Chairman of the 
Audit Committee 
of Axes
stel™s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
eventually 
requested information about these sale

concealed facts that would have exposed the fraud and provided false information to the 
Audit Committee

was 
later shared with Axesstel™s auditor.

 14. As a public company, Axesstel was required to file quarterly and annual 
reports with the 
SEC
 that presented its financial results in conformity with 
Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (
GAAP).   15. GAAP requires that revenue must both 
be 
realized or real
izable and earned 
before it can be recognized
 by a company
.  See
 Financial Accounting Standards Board™s 
Accounting Standards Codification (ﬁASCﬂ) 605
-10-25-1 (ﬁ
Revenue and Gains
ﬂ).  
Revenue
 is deemed realizable when 
(i)
 there is
 persuasive evidence 
that
 an arrangement 
exists; (ii)
 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the seller™s price to 
the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability 
of the purchase price 
is 
reasonably assured.  
See
 id.; see also 
ASC
-605
-10-S99
.  Fur
ther, under Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 48, 
Revenue Recognition When Right
 of Return Exists 
(ﬁFAS 
48ﬂ), revenue shall not be recognized if the buyer's obligation to
 pay the seller is 
contingent on the resale of the product or if the seller has 
significant
 obligations to bring 
about the resale of the product by the buyer.
 16. At the direction and with the participation of Gray, Hickock
, and Sabin, 
Axesstel fraudulently recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first 
quarter of 2013.  A
s detailed below, revenue from
 numerous
 purported sales was 
recognized in 
both 
periods even
 though 
the criteria for revenue recognition under GAAP 
had not been met. 
 In each instance, Axesstel lacked persuasive evidence 
that a sales 
arrangement
 existed
, th
e sales price
s were 
neither fixed nor determinable, delivery 
never

had not occurred
 during the reporting period
, and

 collectability was 
uncertain and, in some instances, unlikely.
 Axesstel 
Reported Material Amounts of 
Improper Revenue 
 in 
the
 Fourth Quarter 
of 
2012
  17. On 
February 28
, 2013, Axesstel filed with the SEC its 
annual report on 
Form 
10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012 (ﬁ2012 Form 10
-Kﬂ)
, which 
Gray
 and 
Hickock signed and certified was a truthful and accurate report of Axesst
el™s financial 
results and performance
.  The 
2012 
Form 10
-K reported 
fourth
 quarter 2012
 revenue 
that 
improperly included 
more than 
$10
.5 million
 in revenue
 Œ 66% of 
revenue that 
quarter
 Œfrom purported sales to 
Company A, a 
South African telecommunications company, 
Company B, a 
Scandinavian
 telecommunications company
, and 
Company C, a 
Nigerian 
telecommunications company.
  GAAP 
precluded recognition of revenue from
 these 
transactions
 during the fourth quarter.  
  Contingent Sales to 
Company A
 18. On or about December 21, 2012,  Axesstel customer 
Company A
 Œ a South 
African
 distribution company that sold to end
-users 
in South Africa and elsewhere on the 
African continent
 Œ purportedly or
dered 
35,000 Axesstel AG50 
alarm systems and 5,000 
Axesstel SP100 mobile 
phones
, with total
 projected revenue 
of $4.1 million 
for Axesstel 
from these sales
.  The orders were 
initially 
reflected in two purchase orders that stated 
payment was due 30 days after 
Company A
™s acceptance o
f the product.  
Simultaneous
ly, 
Axesstel 
sales personnel 
entered into a side agreement with 
Company A
, which made 
Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.6   Page 6 of 30  7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Company A
™s payment obligation 
contingent on
 its 
receipt of 
ﬁrequirements from the end 
customerﬂ and allowed 
Company A
 to cancel the order if 
end
-user 
purchase 
agreements 
did not materialize.  
Axesstel 
sales personnel also 
agreed ﬁ
at no cost to 
[Company A
 to] 
facilitate shipments to be held in China until the actual 
[purchase orders]
 and terms 
between 
[the end customers]
 and 
[Company A]
 are comp
leted
.ﬂ  
 19.   Sabin discussed the 
ac
tual 
terms of the 
Company A
 transaction
 with Gray, 
who was subsequently included on email communications 
with Axesstel sales personnel 
about 
the need to obtain revised purchase orders from 
Company A
 after
 the end of the 
fourth quarter
.    20. In January 2013, at Gray™s request, Sabin instructed Axesstel™s sales 
personnel to obtain 
revi
sed purchase order
s from 
Company A
 to eliminate the payment 
contingency from the face of the purchase order
, and to i
ncreas
e the price of each unit by 
$10
.  Internally, Axesstel™s executives 
justified the
 price increase 
as 
a payment for 
Axesstel™s marketing services
, but Axesstel had no agreement with 
Company A
 to provide marketing 
and 
development 
services 
for its products and n
o expectation that 
Company A
 would actually pay the additional $10 per unit
.    21. In contemporaneous email communications, 
Sabin acknowledged that a side 
agreement making 
Company A
™s payment obligation contingent on resale to its own 
customers could pose a c
oncern from an audit standpoint and hoped to create a ﬁclean 
paper trailﬂ for Axesstel™s auditor.  
 Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.7   Page 7 of 30  8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 22. At Gray™s 
direction
, Sabin instructed 
Axesstel™s 
sales personnel to obtain 
the 
revised purchase orders from 
Company A
 by January 20, 
when 
Axesstel™s auditor
s were 
expected 
to review the sales documentation
.  Axesstel™s 
sales personnel complied with 
the instruction.  
The revised purchase orders were backdated to December 2012.
  The 
revised purchase orders concealed from Axesstel™s auditors the fact that Axesstel had 
given
 a consignment agreement to
 Company A
.  The price increase in the revised 
purchase orders increased Axesstel™s reported revenues for the quarter.
 23. Axesstel
, through
 the efforts of Gray, Hickock, and Sabin,
 improperly 
recognized $
4.1 million from 
these
 purported fourth quarter sales to 
Company A
 and 
included this revenue in the financial results that it reported in its 2012 Form 10
-K.   24. Because 
the 
price was not fixed
 or determinable by quarter
-end,
 and 
Company A
™s 
obligation to make payment was contingent on 
its ability to resell 
Axesstel™s product to its own customers (and therefore
 collectabilit
y was not reasonably 
assured
), revenue from 
the 
purported sales to 
Company A
 was neither realized nor 
realizable, nor earned, as required by GAAP and should not have been recognized 
in
 the 
fourth
 quarter of 2012.  
 25. As it turned out, 
Company A
 did not 
sell the units 
to its 
end user customers 
and, consistent with the 
side 
agreement, 
Company A
 did not pay Axesstel anything
 for 
the units.  
In November 2013, Axesstel recorded all $4.1 million of 
Customer A
™s 
purported purchase as returned to inventory.  
 Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.8   Page 8 of 30  9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Contingent Sales to 
Company B
 26. On or about December 11, 2012, Axesstel cus
tomer 
Company B
 Œ a 
telecommunications distributor that was one of Axesstel™s oldest and largest customers 
Œ  purportedly ordered 25,000 units of Axesstel CDMA 450 Routers for its operations in 
Norway, and 15,000 units of the same product for its operation
s in Sweden
, with total 
projected revenue for Axesstel from these sales of $5 million
.  Axesstel
, through its
 sales 
personnel
, simultaneously
 entered into a
 separate
 side agreement with 
Company B
 that 
altered the terms reflected in 
Company B
™s purchase orders and 
secretly 
allowed 
Company B
 to pay 
only 
ﬁwhen necessary to match market consumption.ﬂ  A
t the time
, Axesstel™s sales personnel 
further 
confirmed 
that
 Company B
 ﬁwill have no obligation to 
make payments [for the 40,000 units] until the de
vices are actually required.ﬂ 
 27. Gray 
learned of 
Company B
™s side agreement with Axesstel 
prior to signing 
and certifying Axesstel™s 2012 Form 10
-K on February 28, 2013
, and he 
orchestrate
d an 
effort to conceal the side 
agreement
 from Axesstel™s auditor
 when 
Company B
 mistakenly informed the auditor 
during the audit confirmation process 
that its
 payment
 obligations were contingent
 on downstream sales
. 28. In February 2013, 
before the 2012 Form 10
-K was filed, 
Axesstel™s auditor 
contacted 
Company B
 to confirm
 the validity of 
an
 outstanding accounts receivable 
balance Axesstel had reported, which purportedly stemmed from 
its fourth
-quarter 2012 
sales
 to Company B
.  Company B
 informed the auditor that 
its 
payment 
to Axesstel 
was 
Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.9   Page 9 of 30  10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 contingent on shipment of the product, which was consistent with the side agreement but 
not the terms of the purchase orders.   
   29. When 
Gray and Sabin 
learned of 
Company B
™s communication
 with 
Axesstel™s auditor
, they 
asked 
Company B
™s management to 
follow
 up with Axesstel™s 
auditor and 
to 
falsely 
acknowledge 
Company B
™s 
financial responsibility for the full 
amount while concealing the existence of the parties™ side agreement
.  Axesstel sales 
personnel 
secretly 
confirmed to 
Company B
, in an email on which G
ray was 
copied
, that 
Axesstel ﬁ
will eventually adjust pay terms so they align with natural consumption
.ﬂ 30. Axesstel
, through the efforts of Gray, Hickock, and Sabin,
 improperly 
recognized $5
 million from 
this
 purported fourth quarter sale to 
Company B
 and included 
this revenue in the financial results that it reported in its 2012 Form 10
-K.   31. Because price was not fixed or determinable by quarter
-end,
 and
 Company 
B™s 
obligation to make payment was contingent on its ability to resell Axesstel™s product 
to its
 own customers (and therefore collectability was not reasonably assured), revenue 
from the purported sales to 
Company B
 was neither realized nor realizable, nor earned, as 
required by GAAP and should not have been recognized 
in
 fourth quarter 2012.
 32. As it turned 
out, 
Company B did not pay Axesstel in accordance with the 
terms of the purchase orders.  
Company B made a partial payment 
in April 2013
 and 
Axesstel subsequently took back the remaining product that Company B could not sell.  
Axesstel was unable to sell the product at the same unit price and recorded a loss on the 
sale.

Company C
 33. On or about December 19, 2012, Axess
tel customer 
Company C
, a 
telecommunications distributor in Nigeria, purportedly ordered 5,000 Axesstel AG50 
security alert systems and 5,000 Axesstel SP100 smart phones, with total projected 
revenue for Axesstel of 
$1.4 million
.  These sales were memorial
ized in a 
ﬁholding POﬂ 
dated December 19, 2012, 
which lacked basic terms
 (such as the shipping instructions
), contained incorrect pricing terms, and indicated that 
Company C
 would pay in U.S. 
dollars pursuant to a letter of credit that had not yet been obtained.
 34. In late December
 2012, Axesstel™s sales personnel informed Sabin that 
Company C
™s 
letter of credit was unlikely to come through before the end of 2012.  Sabin 
informed them that he would find ﬁsomewhere to store the product until the 
[letter of 
credit]
 comes through,ﬂ noting that ﬁwe can™t have the product in 
our 
warehouse for the 
year
-end audit.ﬂ  
 35. As anticipated, Axesstel
 did not receive a letter of credit 
or a purchase order 
with corrected terms 
from 
Company C
 by the end of 2012
, and
 as a result Sabin
 did not 
ship
 the product 
to Company C
 before 
the end of 2012
.  Instead, Axesstel held the 
product in a warehouse 
under 
Axesstel™s 
own control
 and 
Axesstel sales personnel 
informed Sabin that the p
roduct 
would 
not be shipped to 
Company C
 until 
they gave
 the 
ﬁgreen light.ﬂ 
 36. As late as January 17, 2013, in an email on wh
ich Gray was 
copied
, Sabin 
instructed Axesstel™s sales personnel to obtain revised purchase orders from 
Company C
, Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.11   Page 11 of 30  12  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 explain

 revenue 
without having to try to explain why our invoices don™t match the PO price (overstated 
by $500k) and the PO™s are contingent and the contingencies have NOT been removed.ﬂ  
Sabin also 
communicated
 that 
Axesstel™s 
auditor had sampled the warehouse a
nd asked 
for shipping documentation for the 
Company C
 order
, and 
Axesstel 
had been 
unable to 
produce shipping documents and produced only cargo receipts. 
 In response, 
Axesstel™s 
sales personnel expressed to Sabin the view that they wished they could ﬁrun 
the business 
under normal termsﬂ instead of being ﬁpushed to hit imaginary numbers.ﬂ 
 37. Axesstel™s records included a 
later invoice, dated January 29, 2013, 
that 
specified 
Company C
 was responsible for prepayment of the full purchase price
 but, a
s of 
that da
te, 
Company C
 had not made any payment
 on the purported sale
. 38. In fact, Axesstel sales personnel had entered into a side agreement, which 
they formally confirmed to 
Company C
 by email 
in February 2013
, providing
 that 
ﬁCompany C
 is not responsible for the ba
lance 
of $
1,435,000 due at 31 Dec 2012, until 
Company C
 has actually received the goods.ﬂ  
 39. Axesstel
, through the efforts of Gray, Hickock, and Sabin,
 improperly 
recognized $1.4
 million from 
this
 purported fourth quarter sale to 
Company C
 and 
included this revenue in the financial results that it reported in its 2012 Form 10
-K.  Because 
the product had not been 
ship
ped
 to Company C
 by the end of the fourth quarter, 
when revenue on the sale was recognized by Axesstel, 
Company C
 had no 
oblig
ation to 
make payment 
at the time revenue was recognized.  Moreover, Axesstel had not received 
Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.12   Page 12 of 30  13  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 a letter of credit by year
-end 
and therefore collectability was not reasonably assured
.  As 
such
, revenue from the
se purported sales was neither realized nor realizable, nor earned, 
as required by GAAP and should not have been recognized 
in
 the fo
urth quarter of 2012.  
 40. As it turned out, 
Company C never paid for the product it had purportedly 
purchased in December 2014.
  On 
February 15, 2013
, Axesstel™s sales personnel 
informed 
Sabin that payment 
was unlikely before the 
last week of February
.  In late 
February, 
Company C
 complained of a technical issue with samples of the SP100 smart 
phones that they had received in Dece
mber, and refused to accept shipment
.  In 
November 2013, Axesstel recorded all $1,435,000 million of Customer C™s purported 
purchase as returned to inventory
. 41.   In total, as a result of 
Gray
™s, Hickoc
k™s,
 and Sabin
™s knowing or reckless 
misconduct
 related to the purported sales to 
Company A
, Company B
, and 
Company C
, Axesstel improperly recognized $
10.5 million
 in revenue in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2012, 
amounting to 6
6% of 
the Company™s
 total reported 
revenue for the
 quarter and more than 
17% of tot
al reported revenue for fiscal year 2012
. 42. On or about 
February 25, 2013
, Gray and Hickock
 knowingly o
r recklessly
 signed a letter to Axesstel™s auditor 
certifying, among other things, that (i) the 
Company™s financial statements for the year ending December
 31, 2012
 had been 
prepared in accordance with GAAP and properly recorded all material transactions; 
(ii)
 they had reviewed the criteria for revenue re
cognition and were recognizing revenue 
in accordance therewith; (iii) they had fully disclosed all sales 
terms including all

deficiencies in Axesstel™s internal control over financial reporting.  
 43. Revenue from these 
fourth quarter 
2012 
transactions
 was included in 
Axesstel
™s 
financial statements 
for the quarter and reported 
in its 
2012 
annual report for 
the period ended 
December
 31, 2012.  Gray and Hickock signed and certified the
 2012 
annual report on Form 10
-K that 
Axesstel
 filed with the 
SEC
 on 
February 28, 2013
, knowingly or recklessly disregarding the fact that it contained 
false and misleading 
financial statement
s. Axesstel 
Reported Material Amounts of 
Improper Revenue 
 in the
 First Quarter 
of 
2013
  44. In early March 2013, prior to the 
end 
of the 
first 
quarter, 
Gray and 
Axes
stel™s sales personnel discussed how Axesstel™s 
financial results for the 
quarter 
were
 shaping up and, specifically, whether Axesstel would break even or report a loss.   Gray 
suggested that the sales personnel make a last attempt to close ord
ers in Africa, which 
would enable Axesstel to avoid reporting a loss, which was also consistent with 
Hickock™s desire to avoid dropping into a loss for the quarter. 
 45. On or about March 27, 2013, 
Sabin and 
Axesstel™s sales personnel sent Gray 
purchase orders that purported to reflect an order 
of 25,000 
units of Axesstel™s AG50 
security alert system
 by 
Company D
, a Zimbabwe
an
 telecommunications company, 
and 
an order of
 14,500 
units of Axesstel™s AX52R 
security alert system 
by Company E
, a 
Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.14   Page 14 of 30  15  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 South African telecommunications company
, with total projected revenue of 
$3.9 
million
.    46. In fact, neither 
Company D
 nor 
Company E
 had committed to purchase 
specific quantities of Axesstel alert systems by the end of 
the first quarter 
of 
2013
.  Instead, 
Axesstel™s sales personnel fabricated 
ﬁholding POsﬂ for the purported sales
.   47. In discussions and communications with Sabin 
in late March 2013, 
Axesstel™s sales personnel referred to the 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 purchase orders as 
ﬁholding POsﬂ that would be replaced with ﬁrealﬂ purchase orders sometime in April 
2013 (after the end of the first quarter of 2013), and forwarded 
Microsoft 
Word version
s of the POs to Sabin in case changes needed to made.  Sabin provi
ded these ﬁholding 
POsﬂ to Gray for revenue recognition on the sales.
 48. No later than March 30, 2013, Gray and Hickock were explicitly informed 
by Axesstel sales personnel that the purchase orders upon which Axesstel booked first 
quarter revenues were ﬁholdi
ng POsﬂ and that ﬁreal POsﬂ were not expected until mid
-to
-late April, when 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 expected to have letters of credit in place.  
Gray and Hickock were also told that 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 both would ultimately 
take fewer units than was r
eflected in the ﬁholding POs.ﬂ  
 49. Gray and Hickock also were aware that Axesstel™s sales personnel had 
adjusted upwards by at least $10 per unit the
 price on the products reflected in the 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 purchase orders.  Gray and Hickock had author
ized this 
price increase in part to enable Axesstel to hit revenue targets for the quarter.
 Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.15   Page 15 of 30  16  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 50. With negotiations over price, quantity, and payment terms ongoing
 well into 
the second quarter,
 Axesstel did not ship the products to 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 by 
the end of the first quarter 
of 
2013
 and
 Gray, Hickock, and Sabin all 
knew
 that these 
shipments did not take place
.  51. In total, as a result of Gray™s, Hickock™s, and Sabin™s knowing or reckless 
misconduct
 related to the purported sales to 
Company D
 and 
Company E
, Axesstel 
improperly recognized 
$3.9 million
 in revenue in the 
first quarter of 2013
, amounting to 
38% of the Company™s total reported 
revenue for the period.
  Because 
Axesstel lacked 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery 
did not 
occur
 before the end of the 
quarter
, and Axesstel™s price to 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 was neither fixed nor 
determinable, 
revenue from the purported sales to
 Company D
 and 
Company E
 was 
neither realized nor realizable, nor earned, as required by GAAP and should 
not have 
been recognized 
in
 the first quarter of 201
3.   52. Gray
, Hickock, and Sabin
 knew or were reckless in not knowing that (i) 
the 
purchase orders for the first quarter 2013 
sales to 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 were 
ﬁholding 
purchase ordersﬂ that did not 
reflect final agreements with the customers; 
(ii)
 the actual price to be paid by the customers
 and the payment terms
 had yet to be 
dete
rmined or agreed by quarter
-end; and (iii)
 neither 
Company D
 nor 
Company E
 had 
committed to purchasing a specified quanti
ty 
of product by quarter
-end.  
 53. On April
 30,
 2013, before Axesstel filed is first quarter Form 10
-Q, Hickock 
informed Gray, Sabin
, and Axesstel™s sales personnel that he was not in favor of using 
Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.16   Page 16 of 30  17  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ﬁholding POsﬂ on a going
-forward basis because it accelerate
s revenues and creates 
problems for future quarters.  He allowed the use of ﬁholding POsﬂ for the first quarter
 but informed them via email that ﬁ[o]nce we dig out of this hole I want to sell to real 
demand only.ﬂ  
 54. On or about May 8, 2013, 
Gray and Hickock signed a 
letter to Axesstel™s 
auditor
 certifying, among other things, that (i) the Company™s financial statements for the 
first quarter of 2013 had been prepared in accordance with GAAP and properly recorded 
all material transactions; (ii)
 they had reviewed the criteria for revenue recognition and 
were recognizing revenue in accordance therewith; (iii) they had fully disclosed all sales 
terms including all customer acceptance provisions and rights of return; and (iv) there 
were no significa
nt deficiencies in Axesstel™s internal control over financial reporting.  
Gray and Hickock knew or were reckless in not knowing that these representations were 
false at the time they were made.
 55. Revenue from the 
purported sales 
to 
Company D
 and 
Company E
 was included in the Company™s financial statements containe
d in 
its
 periodic report on 
Form 
10-Q for the period ended March 31, 201
3.  Gray and Hickock signed and certified this 
periodic report that was filed with the 
SEC
 on May 1
4, 201
3, knowingly or 
recklessly 
disregarding the fact that it contained false and misleading financial statements.
 56. Ultimately, neither Company D nor Company E ever paid for the products 
they purportedly purchased in the first quarter of 2013.  
In November 2013, Axesstel

 Axesstel™s 
Audit Committee and Auditor
 57. In 
Fall 2013, 
an Axesstel 
sales 
executive
 in Europe 
reported to Axesstel™s 
Board of 
Directors 
that 
Axesstel had improperly recognized revenue from incomplete 
sales to multiple customers in the fourth 
quarter
 of 20
12 and the first quarter of 2013.
 58. The Axesstel sales executive
 alleged that
, in connection with 
these 
illegit
imate 
sales, 
Axesstel
 had
 (i) afforded flexible payment terms to customers
; (ii)
 granted customers rights of return if the customer
s couldn™t resell the goods; and 
(iii)
 not fully 
transferred
 con
trol of product to the 
customer by the close of the periods in 
which revenue was recognized and reported.
 59. Axesstel™s 
Board of 
Directors tasked the 
Chairman of 
the
 Audit 
Committee 
with
 investigat
ing
 these allegations and report
ing
 his findings to the 
Board of 
Directors 
for 
appropriate action.
 60. In connection with his investigation, 
the
 Audit 
Committee 
Chair interviewed 
Gray, Hickock
, and Sabin 
and asked them each 
to provide all available documentation 
concerning materia
l sales to Axesstel customers in the fourth quarter of 
2012
 and first 
quarter of 2013
. 61. In response
, Gray, 
Hickock,
 and Sabin represented to the 
Audit Committee 
Chair that they had no relevant documentation to provide
, thereby 
deliberately concealing 
their fraud
ulent
 conduct 
from 
Axesstel™s Audit Committee
.  They also told 
the Audit 
Case 3:18-cv-01486-L-AGS   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   PageID.18   Page 18 of 30  19  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Committee Chair
 that the purchase orders accurately reflected Axesstel™s agreements 
with customers, there were no open terms at the time revenue was recognized and the 
customers did not have a right to return the products. 
 62. At the conclusion of his investigation, 
Axesstel™s Audit Committee 
Chair
 informed 
Axesstel™s B
oard of 
Directors and 
the company™s 
auditor
 that the European 
sales employee™s accusations 
of accounting improprieties appeared to be unfounded
. 63. In the first quar
ter of 2014, Axesstel™s auditor 
questioned the fact
 that 
Axesstel had not yet received payment for 
the first quarter 2013

88,88,"On June 8, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint charging Curative Biosciences, Inc. f/k/a Healthient, Inc. and corporate insiders with fraudulently misrepresenting that the company had issued company shares to third parties in purported compensation for services and in discharge of company debt when, in fact, the company issued the shares for capital raising purposes in violation of the offering registration requirements.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges the company, the then Chairman of the board of directors, William M. Alverson, his wife, Katherine West Alverson, who was then a director and the company CEO and President, and business associate, Steven G. Patton, with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the company, Alverson, and West with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Alverson and West are liable for the company's violations in their capacity as control persons and as aiders and abettors, and that Patton is liable as an aider and abettor of the company's, Alverson's, and West's violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c). West is named as a defendant and, in the alternative, relief defendant. Two private entities controlled by Alverson and/or West, Northeast Capital Group, LLC and Panacea Holdings Inc., are named as relief defendants. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against the defendants; disgorgement plus prejudgment interest from the defendants and relief defendants; civil money penalties against the company, Alverson, and West; penny stock bars against the individual defendants; and officer-and-director bars against Alverson and West.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Patton consented to the entry of a final judgment, entered by the court on June 19, 2018, that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Securities Act Section 5, bars him from participating in any future penny stock offerings, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $32,203.95 with prejudgment interest of $5,407.95.","  FIRST

 to pay a 
claim
 that was 
much smaller than the value of the shares

Pursuant to the plan, 
Alverson
 directed Patton to sell
 all of the shares 
the Company 
issued to him and 
entities controlled by him
, keep a small payment for himself, and di

the proceeds back to Alverson and West, via Northeast Capital Group

, and some business expenses. 
 5. In the
 2013 
10-Ks filed with the 
SEC
 in September and October 2013, 
the Company
, Alverson, and West
 informed the investing public that 
the Company 
had 
previously 
registered 
and issued 
20.5 million shares 
pursuant to a
n equity 
compensation 
plan (the ﬁPlanﬂ) registered using the 
Form S

(ﬁS

 and issued for services
.  Contrary to these representations, 
the
 Company, Alverson, and West 
authorized and 
issued
 17.23 mi
llion shares to
 Patton 
who
 only 
provided 
negligible 
services to the Company
; Alverson
, or Patton at his 
direction, 
sold t

 Patton 
rout

 Alverson.  
Patton wired more than 
$2 million 
from the sale of these shares 
to 
Northeast Capital.  
    6. The Company, Alverson, and West also state
d in
 the 
2013 10

, with approval of a reviewing court,
 the Company
 authorized the issuance of
 19.1

 pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act 
[15

 that had 
been purchased by a ﬁthird party and a non

Patton™s entity, 
Surfside.  
Contrary to 
these representations, the Compa

worth 18 times the amount of pending claim to Surfside.  Alverson maintained 
control over all of these shares and 
sold or directed Patton to sell
 the shares

from

 3(a)(10) 
shares to the public 
without a 
registration statement in effect
.  Section
 3(a)(10) requires that the ﬁterms and conditionsﬂ of the issuance be disclosed to the 
reviewing court.  
The
 Company, 
Alverson and West failed to disclose to the 
reviewing court the true terms and conditions of the issuance 
involving Patton
.  Accordingly,
 the 
exemption did not apply.

  17. Alverson and West 
directed the Company to 
issue 
more than 
33 million 
shares
 of the
 Company
™s common
 stock
 to 
themselves
.  The Company, Alverson, and 
West told investors that 
the shares were issued to pay
 employee
s and
 consultant
s for 
services 
and as payment
 to a third
-party to discharge 
claim

he Company
.  The Alversons 
had actually 
directed the Company
 to issu
e 
all 
33 million 
shares to a 
business acquaintance, Patton
, or his entity, Surfside.  Patton 
agreed 
in advance 
to 
accept the share

the shares 
himself 
at 
Alverson™s
 direction
, and wire the bulk of the proceeds to Northeast and Panacea,

controlled by 
Alverson and/or West. 
 In this manner, 
Patton paid the 
Alversons
 approximately $4 million from th
e sale of these shares
 that the Alversons
 used for business and personal expenses.
   18. Between May 
and 
August 2013, the Company, Alverson, West
, and 
Patton
 illegally sold more than 7 million shares of 
the Company™s
 stock 
without a 
valid registration statement and

 21. As of the first day of the Company™s 2011 and 2012 fis
cal years, July 1, 
2010 and July 1, 2011, the Company did not have 300 shareholders of record.  Thus, 
its obligation to file periodic reports pursuant to Section 15(d) was suspended, and the 
Company was ineligible to file a Form S
-8 registration statement 
to register an 
offering of Company shares 
during those fiscal years.  
 22. In fiscal year 2011, the Company adopted 
the Plan
 and identified 
the 
Plan 
on the registration statement 
filed with 
the 
Commission pursuant to
 Form S
-8. 
 The Company 
purportedly
 register
ed 8,500,000 shares of its common stock
 pursuant 
to the Plan
 on the Form S
-8 registration statement filed with the 
SEC
.  The Company 
purportedly registered 
an additional 12,000,000 shares of its common stock on an 
amendment to Form S
-8 registration stateme
nt filed with the 
SEC
 in January 2012. 
   23. In 
or around 
March 2
011, Alverson
 asked 
Patton
 whether 
he would be 
willing to perform 
internet marketing services for the Company.  
 24. At a meeting in 
or around 
May 2011, attended by Alverson, West, and 
Patton, Alver
son proposed that 
the Company would issue 
purported
 S-8 shares to 
Patton
, but that the shares would remain subject to Alverson™s control.
  Alverson 
further 
explained that 
Patton 
would have to 
open a brokerage account at a firm 
designated by Alverson 
into which Patton was to deposit the S
-8 shares and over 
which Patton was to 
grant Alverson trading authority
. Alverson 
made clear that he 
would 
direct Patton when to sell the shares and/or 
sell the shares himself pursuant to 
his trading authority over the
 account
.  Alverson 
further indicated that 
Patton 
would 
wire the bulk of the sales proceeds 
as directed by Alverson, and 
retain some portion 
of the proceeds as compensation for 
Patton™s 
facilitating the sales.
  25. Patton agreed to the arrangement proposed by 
Alverson.
   26. In June 2011, at Alverson™s direction, Patton opened a brokerage 
account in CDS™s name with 
a Utah
-based brokerage
 firm
 (the ﬁbrokerage
 firm
ﬂ)
 and 
allowed Alverson trading authority in that account

 instructed the Company™s 
then 
transfer agent, 
located in Nevada, to issue S

 28. Between 
July 1, 2011
 and March 12, 2012
, Alverson and West
 held 
four 
special meetings of the board of directors at which they were the only attendees
.  Subse
quently, on August 6 and September 26, 2012, Alverson and West, as the only 
participating board members, generated unanimous written consents of the board. 
  During these 
four 
meetings
 and in these two consents, 
Alverson and West
 authorized 
the issuance of
 17.23
million
 purported
 S-8 shares
 to Patton pursuant to
 Alverson™s 
agreement with Patton
.  Specifically, 
the minutes of the special meetings, which West 
signed, memorialized in writing that 
Alverson and West
 authorized 
shares 
to be 
issued to
 Patton ﬁfor 
services rendered to the [Company] pursuant to the [Company™s] 
2010 Equity Compensation Plan . . .  [which ha

at Alverson and West authorized shares to be issued to 
Patton 
ﬁfor services rendered to the [Company] . . . pursuant to the [Company™s] 2010 
Equity Compensation Plan, as amended.ﬂ 
   29. West issued written instructions
 via email
 -- on Company letterhead and 
signed by her in her capacity as the Company™s CEO and President 
-- to the 
Company™s 
Utah
-based 
transfer agent to issue a specified number of ﬁS
-8ﬂ shares in 
the name of Patton.  
West also signed a standard representation letter required by the 
transfer age
nt before it would issue a stock certificate in which West represented that 
the shares were issued under the Company™s 2010 Equity Compensation Plan 
registered on Form S
-8 and 
filed with the 
SEC
 on November 9, 2010
 or, as amended,  
January 10, 2012
.  West 
also falsely claimed
 in the letter
 that ﬁthe sh
ares issued were 
not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital
-raising transaction 
–. ﬂ
  30. As a result of the foregoing, 
the transfer agent

17.23 million

account between June 2011 and October 2012.
   31.  Although Patton began receiving shares in June 2011, 
from 
that time 
throu
gh the present, Patton performed negligible services.  
 32. Beginning in late June 2011
, and continuing through early October 2012, 
Alverson, or Patton at Alverson™s direction, placed sell orders with 
the brokerage
 firm 
to sell all 17.23 million purported S
-8 shares through the CDS brokerage account, 
generating gross illicit proceeds of $
2,365,591
.  Patton and Alverson placed sales 
calls 
from multiple locations including

 Malibu, 
California.
 33. Beginning in July 2011

ough October 2012

multiple locations, including Malibu, California
, Pat
ton, at Alverson™s direction,
 wired

Northeast Capital 
purportedly

services were provided.  
At or around the time of receiving each invoice, 
Patton

issuance of four million restricted shares to Patton (ﬁthe Restricted Sharesﬂ) 
purportedly for
 $400,000 of
 services rendered.  
Patton deposited the shar

the 
Alverson
s directed be issued in CDS™s name, 
into the CDS brokerage account.  
Patton had performed negligible services at that time, but represented to the 
brokerage
 firm
 that he had provided full consideration for the Restricted Shares by 
September 5, 2011.  Patton then sold the Restricted Shares prior to the running of the 
required holding period and directed the bulk of the proceeds to the Alverson
s in the 
same manner a
s with the purported S

   37. Alverson and West used the

and spas.  
 2. The Company, 
Alverson
, and West Authorized the Company
 to Issu

Shares 
to 
Surfside  
  38.  Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act permits a company to issue

or property interestsﬂ without having to file a registration statement, ﬁwhere the terms 
and conditions of
 such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing upon the 
fairness of such terms and conditionsﬂ by any court.
 39. On April 5, 2012, an entity called Siesta Flow LLC obtained a judgment 
for breach of contract against the Company in the Twelfth Judicial
 Circuit Court in 
and for Sarasota County, Florida in the amount of $95,159.99.
 40. Alverson 
again 
approached Patton 
and proposed that 
a Patton
-controlled 
entity buy the claim from Siesta Flow and two associated claims against the 
Company from attorneys for se
rvices rendered and
, in turn, the Company would issue 
shares to the Patton
-controlled entity in satisfaction of the claims.  
Alverson then 
told 
Patton that t
he Patton
-controlled entity would sell the shares and divert most of the 
proceeds to Alverson
-contr
olled entities while retaining a portion as compensation for 
facilitating the sales.
  Alverson made this proposal via telephone
 to Patton who
 was 
physically located 
in the Central District of California
 at the time Alverson placed 
and Patton took the call.
  41. Patton agreed to the proposal.
 42. Alverson told Patton that CDS could not be the entity to purchase the 
claims because Alverson wanted to avoid questions about CDS™

 43. In April 2012, Patton incorporated Surfsi
de in California 
to effectuate 
the transactions
.   44. On April 24, 2012, Surfside entered into an assignment of claims 
agreement which obligated it to pay a total of $95,500
 in satisfaction of the 
claims: 
 $75,000 to Siesta Flow; $16,000 to counsel who had defended the Company in the 
Siesta Flow litigation; and $4,500 to counsel who issued a legal opinion in connection 
with the settlement.  
Accordingly, 
Surfside took assignment of the three claims 
against t
he Company.
 45. Also on April 24, 2012, West, in her corporate capacity, and Patton, on 
behalf of Surfside, signed a Share Issuance Agreement which called for the Company 
to issue 19.1 million shares to Surfside ﬁfor the relinquishment of the Claimsﬂ 
Surfside 
now held against the Company, subject to court approval. 
 46. Alverson told Patton that Patton would retain beneficial interest in and 
control of two million of the 19.1 million shares to be issued
 to Surfside
, and that 
Alverson would retain beneficial interes
t in and control 
of 
the remaining 17.1 million 
shares.
 47. On April 27, 2012, the Company filed a motion in the Sarasota County 
court for an order approving the settlement and 
assessing the fairness of the 
assignment of claims and share issuance.
  In support o
f the motion, the Company 
submitted, among other documents, a copy of the Share Issuance Agreement and an 
opinion letter from an attorney advising that the share issuance complied with the 
requirements of Securities Act Section 3(a)(10).
 48. The Company
 failed
 to mention, in any of the documents that it filed 
with
 the Sarasota County court
, the side agreement between Alverson
 and Patton 
pursuant to which Alverson retained 
ultimate control of the 
majority of the 
shares to 
be issued
.  Further
, no party to the pro
ceeding informed the court of the side 
agreement.
  Additionally, the 
Company 
falsely claimed

, even 
though Patton had 
incorporated Surfside at Alverson™s direction 
and was allow
ing Alverson to control 
the sale of the shares that would be issued.  
   49. The court ultimately issued an order approving the settlement and stating 
that the issuance of the 19.1 million shares ﬁwould conform to the provisions of 
Section 3(a)(10).ﬂ 
 50. At that 
time
, the 
fair market value of the shares determined by 
multiplying the number of shares, 19.1 million, by the then per share market price, 
$.09
, was approximately 
$1.7 million, or 18 times the value of the 
claims 
being 
settled.
   51. Surfside 
discharged the $
95,500 settlement amount by making three 
separate payments, the last of which Patton made out in the amount of $16,000 on or 
about April 18, 2013
, and which was drawn on Surfside™s bank account on April 22, 
2013.
 52. In October 2012, Patton opened a brokerage 
account in Surfside™s name
 with the 
same 
brokerage firm with which CDS held its brokerage account
. 53. The Share Issuance Agreement provided that Surfside could not hold 
more than 9.99% of the issued and outstanding Company common stock at a given 
time.  As a 
result, Alverson and West 
directed the Company to issue the 19.1 million 
authorized Section 3(a)(10) shares 
incrementally.  During the 
eight months
 between 
October 2012 
and 
June 2013
, Alverson
 and West 
signed eleven unanimous written 
consents 
of the Compan
y™s board of directors 
in which they authorized the 
Company 
to issue a specified number of 
purported Section 3(a)(10) shares
 to Surfside
.  54. Each of the unanimous consents described the shares authorized as 
ﬁRule 3(a)10 [sic] Court Approved Issuance
ﬂ, and 
authorized the officers to take 
steps necessary to effectuate the transactions.
 55. Pursuant to that authority, West issued written instructions to 
the 
Company™s transfer agent
 via email
 to issue 
stock certificates for 
a specified number

  West issued the

12.95 million 
Company shares (
of the 19.1 million 
Section 3(a)(10) 
shares authorized) to Surfside 
which Patton, acting on behalf of Surfside, deposited into 
Surfside™s account
 with the 
brokerage firm
. 57. Beginning on November 7, 2012
, and continuing through August 30, 
2013, Alverson, or P
atton at Alverson™s direction, sold 11
.88 million 
of the purported 
Section 3(a)(10) shares through the Surfside brokerage account, generating gross
 illicit 
proceeds of $2,206,153.
  Patton made 
sales calls to the brokerage 
firm 
from 
multiple locations inclu
ding Malibu
 and Mission Viejo, 
California.
 58. Surfside 
held a

shares
 for less than one year before 
Alverson and/or Patton 
sold
 them into the public market
.   59. During the same time period, Patton, at Alverson™s direction, 
intermit
tently wired 
cash from the Surfside brokerage account, via a Surfside bank 
account, to bank accounts for Northeast Capital and Panacea o
ver
 which West was 
the sole signatory.
 60. Patton ultimately wired $1

 to Northeast Capital

 and $43,210 to Panacea
™s bank account
 while retaining $139,363.95
 for himself for 
executing the transactions
. 61. As before with the purported S

Capital, manufactured bogus invoices to Surfside stating that Northeast Capital had 
provided servi

which corresponded to some (though not all) of the 
 cash

.   62. The first nine invoices, from November 14, 2012 through January 28,

89,89,"On June 26, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a credit ratings agency employee with tipping two friends about The Sherwin-Williams Co.'s confidential plans to acquire The Valspar Corp., which he learned of through his work. The SEC also charged the two friends with trading on the illicit tips, which reaped them substantial profits.

According to the SEC's complaint, Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz, an analyst in the credit ratings agency's New York office, learned of the acquisition when Sherwin-Williams consulted the agency about the potential effect of the transaction on its credit rating. The SEC alleges that soon after, Pinto-Thomaz tipped his friends, who bought Valspar securities before the merger was announced. Valspar's shares rose 23 percent on the news and the friends, Abell Oujaddou, a co-owner and co-manager of an upscale New York hair salon, and Jeremy Millul, a New York jeweler, sold their holdings and respectively made approximately $192,000 and $107,000 in profits.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Pinto-Thomaz, Oujaddou, and Millul with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Pinto-Thomaz, Oujaddou, and Millul.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David C. Austin, Melanie A. MacLean, and Simona K. Suh of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and by Debbie Chan of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas and Mathew Wong of the unit's Analysis and Detection Center.  The case has been supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Austin, Ms. MacLean, and Ms. Suh. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 1 of 12Joseph G.

No.18 Civ. COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMANDED Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") files this Complaint against defendants Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz (""Pinto-Thomaz""), Abell Oujaddou (""Oujaddou""), and Jeremy Millul (""Millul"") ( collectively, ""Defendants"") and alleges as follows: SUMMARY 1. This case involves insider trading by Pinto-Thomaz, Oujaddou, and Millul in advance of the March 20, 2016 announcement (the ""Announcement"") that The Williams Company (""Sherwin-Williams"") had agreed to acquire The Valspar Corporation (""Valspar""). In early March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz, a credit ratings analyst at a major credit ratings agency (the ""Credit Ratings Agency""), learned of the impending acquisition when  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 2 of 12Sherwin-Williams consulted the Credit Ratings Agency about the deal. Shortly thereafter, Thomaz misappropriated this confidential information by tipping his friends Oujaddou and Millul to purchase Valspar securities. After the acquisition was made public, Oujaddou and Millul sold their Valspar securities generating total illicit profits of approximately $300,000. 2. Pinto-Thomaz began learning material nonpublic information about the acquisition approximately twelve days before the Announcement, when Sherwin-Williams reached out to the Credit Ratings Agency to seek its view on the potential effect of the acquisition on Sherwin-Williams' s credit rating. 3. On the morning of March 8, 2016, within minutes of his first contact with a representative of Sherwin-Williams about the project, Pinto-Thomaz called and then texted Oujaddou. Later that day and in the following days, Pinto-Thomaz continued to work on the project related to the planned Sherwin-Williams transaction with Valspar and to communicate with Oujaddou. 4. On the morning of March 10, 2016, shortly after communicating with Pinto-Thomaz, Oujaddou made his first purchase ever of Valspar stock, purchasing 1,000 shares in a personal trading account. 5. Between March 11 and March 18, Pinto-Thomaz continued to communicate with Oujaddou, who purchased an additional 7,630 shares of Valspar stock during that same time period. 6. Pinto-Thomaz also tipped his friend Millul. In the early morning hours of Sunday, March 13, 2016, just a few days after Pinto-Thomaz first learned of the acquisition, Millul opened a trading account with an online broker-dealer (the ""Online Broker""). Prior to this, Millul did not hold a brokerage account. 2  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 3 of 127. After communicating with Pinto-Thomaz, Millul, on Wednesday and Friday, March 16 and 18, 2016, purchased 480 shares of Valspar stock and 75 Valspar call options with the expiration date of April 15, 2016. 8. On Sunday, March 20, 2016, Sherwin-Williams and Valspar announced the acquisition, and on the next trading day, Monday, March 21, 2016, the price of Valspar shares increased by more than 23% over the prior trading day's closing price. 9. Millul sold all of his Valspar shares and options that same morning, March 21, 2016, realizing a profit of approximately $107,000. Oujaddou sold his shares later that week, on March 23 and 24, 2016, realizing a profit of approximately $192,000. VIOLATIONS 10. By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, each of the Defendants, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, violated Section lO(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule lOb-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.l0b-5]. Unless the Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they will again engage in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint and in acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar type and object. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT 11. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 2l(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)] and seeks to restrain and permanently enjoin the Defendants from engaging in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein. In addition, the Commission seeks a final judgment (a) ordering the Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest thereon; and (b) ordering the 3  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 4 of 12Defendants to pay civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u-1]. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21 ( d), 21 A, and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u-1, and 78aa]. 13. Venue lies in this District pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. Certain of the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred within the Southern District of New York. For example, Pinto-Thomaz obtained the relevant material nonpublic information through his work at the New York City headquarters of the Credit Ratings Agency. Moreover, all three Defendants reside in the Southern District of New York, and resided and worked there during the relevant period. DEFENDANTS 14.

Sherwin-Williams is an Ohio corporation headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and a major paint and coating manufacturer. At all relevant times, its common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SHW. 18. Valspar was a Delaware corporation headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and a major paint and coating manufacturer. Before its acquisition by Sherwin-Williams, its common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VAL. On June 1, 2017, Sherwin-Williams completed its acquisition of Valspar. FACTS A. Pinto-Thomaz's Relationships with Ouiaddou and Millul 19. As of March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz and Oujaddou had been friends for years, frequently communicating about personal matters by text message and by phone. 20. As of March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz and Millul were also long-time friends, frequently communicating about personal matters by text message, phone, and email. B. Pinto-Thomaz Tips Ouiaddou and Ouiaddou Trades 21. As of March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz was employed 
by the Credit Ratings Agency in its New York City office as a credit ratings analyst since at least 2015. In that capacity, he was responsible for analyzing the credit rating of Sherwin-Williams, among other issuers. 22. Pinto-Thomaz owed a duty of trust and confidence to his employer, the Credit Ratings Agency, and was obligated to maintain the confidentiality of information learned in the course of his employment. Among other restrictions, he was subject to the Credit Ratings 5  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 6 of 12Agency's policy on the treatment of confidential information, which required employees not to disclose confidential information learned in connection with their work, and not to use or share that information for their personal benefit. 23. Pinto-Thomaz began learning material nonpublic information about the upcoming acquisition of Valspar in or about early March 2016 when Sherwin-Williams reached out to the Credit Ratings Agency to seek its view on the potential effect of the acquisition on Williams' s credit rating. 24. On the morning of March 8, 2016, a representative of Sherwin-Williams called to speak with Pinto-Thomaz in order to set up a meeting between Sherwin-Williams and the Credit Ratings Agency concerning the upcoming acquisition. At 10:08 a.m., Pinto-Thomaz returned that representative's call and spoke with him for three minutes. At 10: 17 a.m., minutes after his call with Sherwin-Williams, Pinto-Thomaz called and then texted Oujaddou. 25. After Pinto-Thomaz's initial contacts with the representative of Sherwin-Williams on March 8, 2016, the Credit Ratings Agency and Sherwin-Williams entered into an agreement for ""RES,"" or ""Ratings Evaluation Service."" 
An RES is a service that internal Credit Ratings Agency documents described as ""a confidential, committee-based evaluation of the probable effect on a client's credit ratings of a proposed hypothetical strategic initiative before its implementation."" In Sherwin-Williams' s case, the service contemplated was a confidential evaluation of the potential effect of the proposed acquisition of Valspar, a major competitor of Sherwin-Williams, on Sherwin-Williams' s credit rating. 26. Information that Sherwin-Williams shared with the Credit Ratings Agency in connection with the RES was material and nonpublic. 6  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 7 of 1227. Pinto-Thomaz continued to work on the Sherwin-Williams RES project and to receive material nonpublic information about the upcoming Valspar acquisition on March 8, 9, and 10, 2016. 28. For example, on the morning of March 10, 2016, Pinto-Thomaz received an email from Sherwin-Williams attaching slides with detailed financial data on the proposed merger and bearing the following header: ""RES REVIEW OF VALSPAR ACQUISITION; [THE CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY]; March 10, 2016; THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY; HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL."" 29. During the same three days, March 8, 9, and 10, 2016, Pinto-Thomaz had multiple additional communications with Oujaddou. 30. On the afternoon of March 10, 2016, less than an hour after one such communication with Pinto-Thomaz, Oujaddou made his first purchase ever of Valspar stock, purchasing 1,000 shares in a personal trading account. 31. On March 11, 14, 
17 and 18, 2016, Oujaddou made additional purchases of Valspar stock. 32. Overall, between March 10 and 18, 2016, Oujaddou accumulated a total of 8,630 shares of Valspar stock, investing over $700,000 in the stock 
in approximately a week. Oujaddou's purchases of Valspar stock were made on the basis of material nonpublic information tipped to him by Pinto-Thomaz. 33. The investment was unusual for Oujaddou. His purchase of Valspar stock between March 10 and 18, 2016, was by far his largest investment in a single issuer's securities in a short span of time since at least 2010. It was also substantially larger than any other investment he made during that time period, aside from his frequent investments over the course 7  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 8 of 12of multiple years in the stock of a major technology company (the ""Technology Company""). Indeed, Oujaddou liquidated substantial portions of his investment in the Technology Company to fund his Valspar stock purchases. C. Pinto-Thomaz Tips Millul and Millul Trades 34. In the days preceding the Announcement, Pinto-Thomaz also tipped material nonpublic information about the Valspar acquisition to his friend Millul. 35. On Sunday, March 13, 2016, at approximately 4:34 a.m., Millul opened a brokerage account with the Online Broker. Prior to opening this account online, Millul did not hold a brokerage account or trade on his own behalf. 36. The next day, March 14, 2016, Pinto-Thomaz and Millul communicated electronically using their personal electronic devices. 37. Two days later, on March 16, 2016, Millul called the Online Broker to request permission to purchase options and trade on margin in his brand new account. That same day, Millul also wired $100,000 into his account at the Online Broker as an opening deposit and immediately purchased 480 shares of Valspar stock for approximately $40,000. 38. On Friday, March 18, 2016, after Millul received authorization to trade options, he also purchased 75 out-of-the-money Valspar call options, expiring on April 15, 2016, with the strike price of $90, for approximately $4,500. 39. Millul's purchases of Valspar stock and options were made on the basis of material nonpublic information tipped to him by Pinto-Thomaz. D. Ouiaddou and Millul Profit from Their Illegal Trades 40. At 1:00 p.m. on Sunday, March 20, 2016, Sherwin-Williams and Valspar announced the acquisition. On the Monday following the Announcement, the price of Valspar 8  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 9 of 12shares increased by $19.39, or 23.13%, from the prior trading day's closing price of $83.83 per share, to close at $103.22 per share. 41. Millul sold all of his Valspar stock and options that same morning, March 21, 2016, realizing a profit of approximately $107,000. 42. Oujaddou sold his shares of Valspar stock later that same week, on March 23 and 24, 2016, realizing a profit of approximately $192,000. Oujaddou then immediately reinvested a large portion of those proceeds in the stock of the Technology Company. E. Pinto-Thomaz Lies in Response to a FINRA Inquiry 43. Shortly after the Announcement, on June 9, 2016, at the request of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA""), an employee of the Credit Ratings Agency emailed Pinto-Thomaz, along with certain other employees who worked on the Sherwin-Williams RES, a list of individuals and entities (the ""FINRA List"") and asked the recipients if they knew any of the persons on the list. Oujaddou's and Millul's names both appeared on the FINRA List. The email requested that all recipients respond by June 17, 2016. 44. On the afternoon of June 14, 2016, after receiving a reminder to respond to the inquiry about the FINRA List, Pinto-Thomaz replied to the inquiry by email, stating: ""No relationship exists between myself and the individuals/entities listed."" Nine minutes later, Thomaz sought to recall the email, and then sent a revised response stating: ""To the best of my knowledge, no relationship exists between myself and the individuals/entities listed."" F. Pinto-Thomaz, Oujaddou, and Millul Acted with Scienter 45. At all relevant times, the Credit Ratings Agency's policies required that its employees, including Pinto-Thomaz, maintain the confidentiality of client-related information and not use this information to trade in securities, or disclose it to others. 9  Case 1:18-cv-05757   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 10 of 1246. Pinto-Thomaz provided tips about the Valspar acquisition to Oujaddou and Millul in breach of his obligations under the Credit Ratings Agency's policies and in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to the Credit Ratings Agency. Pinto-Thomaz knew or recklessly disregarded that he breached these duties by disclosing the material nonpublic information to Oujaddou and Millul. 4 7. Pinto-Thomaz received a personal benefit 
from his tips of material nonpublic information to his friends Oujaddou and Millul, including but not limited to the benefit of providing gifts of the information to two close personal friends. Pinto-Thomaz also knew or recklessly disregarded that Oujaddou and Millul would trade on Pinto-Thomaz' s tips. 48. Oujaddou and Millul each knew, were reckless in not knowing, should have known, or consciously avoided knowing that the tips that Pinto-Thomaz provided to them were conveyed in breach of a fiduciary duty, or a similar obligation arising from a relationship of trust and confidence. 49. Oujaddou and Millul purchased Valspar securities on the basis of Pinto-Thomaz's tips while knowing, or while reckless in not knowing, that the information they received from Pinto-Thomaz was material and nonpublic. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Violations of Section 1 O(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 1 Ob-5 Thereunder (Against All Defendants) 50. The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference herein paragraphs 1 through 49 above. 51.

90,90,"On June 29, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Massachusetts real-estate developer with making several false statements in his attempts to raise funds from potential investors.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that, from 2016-2017, Donato J. Dandreo made several misrepresentations to potential investors in his attempts to finance construction of residential homes through his real-estate development company Bounty Homes Corporation. The SEC's complaint alleges that Dandreo used an internet investment platform to attempt to raise funds. The complaint also alleges that in an attempt to convey the appearance of being a successful fundraiser, Dandreo claimed that Bounty Homes was an ""opportunistic real estate investment company"" and had ""expert first-hand experience at every phase of the investment cycle."" The complaint further alleges that Dandreo claimed to have raised almost $1.5 million from investors, despite having raised no money at all.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dandreo has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $9,239. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC's case was handled by David H. London, Susan Cooke Anderson, John McCann, and Michele Perillo of the SEC's Boston Office."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

92,92,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Bellefonte, Pennsylvania insurance agent with engaging in a Ponzi scheme that targeted retail investors who lacked significant investment experience.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2010 through 2017, James E. Hocker began his relationship with a number of investors by selling them insurance. After allegedly gaining their trust, he encouraged them to invest with him by falsely promising guaranteed returns of between 10% and 30% from investments he would make on their behalf in the S&P 500 and other unspecified investment vehicles. Some investors allegedly withdrew money from their life insurance policy or retirement accounts to fund their investment with Hocker. In fact, Hocker did not invest any of the investors' funds. Instead, he pocketed the money and used it for his personal living expenses such as credit card bills and to make payments to other investors. Over the last five years, Hocker raised approximately $1.27 million from about 25 investors. The investors were largely elderly retirees or individuals nearing retirement, without significant investment experience. Some of Hocker's investors were widows who relied on Hocker to manage their money following the death of their husbands.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, charges Hocker with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks an injunction, disgorgement and penalties.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Breanne Atzert, under the supervision of Lisa Deitch and Antonia Chion. The litigation will be led by Paul Kisslinger and supervised by Cheryl Crumpton. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

   COMPLAINT
  The 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(ﬁCommission
ﬂ or 
ﬁSEC
ﬂ) alleges as follows for 
its complaint against defendant
 James E. Hocker
 (ﬁDefendant
ﬂ or ﬁHockerﬂ
): SUMMARY
 1. From 
at least 
2010 through 
2017, 
Hocker 
engaged in a fraudulent 
investment
 scheme
, in which 
he 
falsely promised 
retail 
investors that he would 
invest their funds and achieve guaranteed returns of between 10% and 30%.
  In 
fact, 
Hocker 
did not invest any of the funds
 but
 instead misappropriated the money 
and used it for his personal living expenses
 and to make payments to other 
investors
.   Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 1 of 13 2  2. During the period of
 July 2013 
through 
October 2017
, Hocker 
raised 
approximately 
$1.27 million from 
about 
25 
investors
 by offering and selling them 
securities
.  He induced them to invest by way of lies, false and misleading 
promises
 and assurances
, and 
other 
deceptive conduct.
  Hocker 
preyed 
primarily 
on older
 investors
 without significant investment experience
, at times encouraging 
them to 
withdr
aw money from their life insurance 
policies 
or retirement accounts
 to invest in 
the 
purported
 investment 
opportunity that he presented.  
Hocker 
received investor checks and 
deposited 
them 
into 
one of three
 bank account
s that 
he 
controlled
.   3. Instead of investing 
the investors™
 money
 as he had represented
, Hocker 
used the majority of the funds for his own personal living expenses
.  For 
example, 
he misapp
ropriated
 investor funds to pay for restaurant and casino 
expenses, to pay 
his 
credit card bills, and to pay spousal support to his ex
-wife.
  None of these 
expend
itures were disclosed to or approved by investors.
 4. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complain
t, 
Hocker 
violated 
the 
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, 
Section 17(a) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (
ﬁSecurities Act
ﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]
, Section 10(b) of the 
Securities 
Exchange Act 
of 1934 (

ﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §
 78j(b)
], and Rule 
10b
-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b

, and unless restrained and enjoined will 
engage in 
further
 violations of these provisions.
 Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 2 of 13 3  5. The Commission seeks an order enjoining 
Hocker 
from 
further
 violations
, requiring 
Hocker 
to disgorge 
his ill
-gotten gains
 plus prejudgment 
interest
, and 
imposing 
monetary

ies.

 9. James E. Hocker
, age 48, is a resident 
of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania
.  From approximately October 2001 to October 2007, Hocker was employed by 
an 
insurance agency
 in Milroy, Pennsylvania as an insurance agent.  Hocker left 
the 
insurance agency
 in 2007 and began selling insurance products and annu
ities under 
the name James E. Hocker & Associates, an unregistered entity.  Hocker holds a 
license to sell insurance products in Pennsylvania
, but he does not hold any license 
relating to the securities industry
.  Hocker 
asserted his Fifth Amendment privil
ege 
against self
-incrimination in connection with the SEC™s investigation of the 
conduct alleged in this complaint
, and
 he refused 
to answer substantive questions 
or produce documents
 pursuant to the SEC™s investigatory subpoenas
. DEFENDANT
™S 
VIOLATIONS
 A. Defendant
 Raise
d Approximately
 $1.27 Million 
From Investors 
 Through
 Misstatements
, False Promises, and 
Deceptive Conduct
  10. During the period of July 2013
 through October 201
7, Hocker 
raised 
approximately $1.
27 million from about 25 investors by 
misrepresenting to 
them 
that he had an investment opportunity that would generate between 10% and 30% 
returns.
  Based on Hocker™s misrepresentations, investors then made payments to 
Hocker for securities in the form of stock, stock funds, investment contra
cts and 
promissory notes.  
 Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 4 of 13 5  11. Hocker 
met investors through his position as an insurance salesman, 
through church or other community groups, or through word of mouth referrals.  
He 
often 
initiated his relationship with investors
 by selling 
them 
life insurance
 policies and annuities.  
Investors 
were largely elderly
 retirees or individuals 
near
ing
 retirement
, without significant investment experience
.  Some of Hocker™s 
investors 
were widow
s who relied on Hocker to manage their money following the 
death of their husbands.
     12. After offering his clients life insurance and annuities, and thereby 
gaining their trust, 
Hocker 
present
ed them with an investment opportunity.  
Some 
investors withdrew 
money from their life insurance policy or retirement accounts 
to invest in 
this additional opportunity.  
 13. The investors wrote checks to Hocker for his 
promised 
investment, 
with at least five investors noting on the memo line of their checks that the funds 
were for an ﬁinvestment.ﬂ  Hocker told 
the investors
 that he would invest their 
funds in the S&P 500 and other unspecified investment vehicles.  
 14. To that end, 
Hocker
 deceptively 
provided at least 11 investors with 
printouts of historical prices for the S&P 500, with the explicit or implied promise 
that he would invest their funds in the S&P 500, or a similar type of equity 
investment. 
 These acts were deceptive a
nd misleadin
g as Hocker did not invest 
the 
investors™
 funds in the S&P 500 or any other 
similar 
investment.
 Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 5 of 13 6  15. Hocker told one investor that his investment would be safe because he 
would take insurance out on the invested funds
, and he would be investing millions 
of dollars on behalf of many investors.
  These representations were false, as 
Hocker did not invest 
funds received from
 the investors
 in any 
type of 
investment.  
He also did not take out any insurance on invested funds.
 16. Hocker also 
falsely promised 
investors that their money would 
generate annual returns, sometimes as high as 30%.  
Investors expected to earn 
returns solely from Hocker™s efforts.  
 17. Hocker
 provided at least 15 investors with a handwritten 
note
 confirming the receipt of funds, and 
falsely 
setting forth a specific rate of returns 
for a defined term.  
A number 
of those handwritten notes stated that the
 money 
given to Hocker was for 
investment.  Many of the handwritten notes also stated
 that th
e in
vestor™s principal, plus a defined rate of return, would be returned to the 
investor on a specific date, with an option to renew for a new term.
  In one 
handwritten note
 signed by Hocker, Hocker indicated the investment would 
provide ﬁtax free growth.ﬂ  
 18. As one 
example
, on 
December 10, 2015
, Hocker
 signed and gave a 
note to an investor in which he 
wrote, 
   Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 6 of 13 7  I, James E. Hocker, received $50,000 from [Investors] for investment for a 
period of one year.  Guarantee rate of return 12 months 25% 50,000 + 
12,500 =
 62,500 due on 12
-10-2016 with option to renew for new 12 month 
term to 12
-10-2017 for 25% rate of return.  New
 rate determined on 12
-10-2018.
    19. As a second example, on or about April 18, 2017, 
Hocker signed and 
gave a note to an investor in which he wrot
e, I, James E. Hocker, received 5,000 from [Investors] on 4
-18-17 
 for one year investment.  Rate of return 30
%.  Total due $6,500 
 4-18-18.  20. Hocker 
provided these 
handwritten notes
 to 
his 
investors, knowing
, or 
reckless in not knowing, that
 they were fals
e and misleading.  He knew
 that he was 
not investing any funds, and that he could not 
possibly 
provide any guaranteed 
retaturns of 25 or 30 percent
, or any ﬁtax free growth.ﬂ
 21. Many investors met with Hocker on an annual basis to review their 
life insurance, annuities and 
purported 
investments.  In 
some
 instance
s, Hocker 
orally provided investors with the current amount of their investment, which 
purportedly correlated to their p
rincipal plus the return percentage he had initially 
promised the investor
.  These were false and misleading statements, as Hocker did 
not invest any of 
the investor
™s funds
, and 
their 
funds
 had not increased in value 
through any investments
.  In fact, 
their 
investment
s were 
depleted by way of 
Hocker™s personal expenditures and his use of pooled funds to pay redemptions to 
existing investors.
 Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 7 of 13 8  22. Based on Hocker™s 
false and misleading 
statements, 
positive reports, 
and deceptive conduct, 
many investors contin
ued to invest additional funds year 
after year.  For instance, one 
investor 
invested $50,000 three times from 2015 to 
mid
-2017, for a total of $150,000.  
 23. When 
investors 
requested their money back, Hocker would dissuade 
them from taking their full investment, and 
in some instances 
encouraged
 the 
investor
s to
 instead take money from 
their 
other
 financial 
accounts.  
Some 
investors 
were repaid small amounts when requested.  M
ore recently, when 
investors 
requested their money back, Hocker told them that it was unavailable
 or 
failed to respond to the investors™ requests
.   24. During the period of July 2013 to October 2017
, Hocker returned 
approximately $236,000 to 
the investors
, wh
ich further perpetuated the fraud
. B. Defendant Misappropriated Funds Received From Investors
  25. Rather than invest any funds from his 
investors
, Hocker deposited 
investor funds into several 
bank
 accounts 
that he 
controlled
.  He 
comingled 
and 
pooled 
the investments together and did not have sub
-accounts for any of 
the 
investors
.  The majority of investor funds were deposited and pooled in an account 
in the name of James E. Hocker & Associates.  James E. Hocker & Associates is 
not a registered business
, and the bank account held in that name reflects little to 
no business activity.  
Hocker was the only signatory on this account.
 Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 8 of 13 9  26.   Hocker deposited other 
investor 
funds into a joint checking account 
held in the name of Hocker and his ex
-wife.  He 
also 
dep
osited a small number of 
investor checks into a savings account held solely by Hocker.  The bank statements 
for these three accounts from 2012 to 2017 do not reflect outgoing payment
s for 
any stock whatsoever, much less any stock included in the S&P 500, o
r payments 
to any other investment vehicle, fund
, or brokerage firm.  Instead, Hocker diverted 
a substantial portion of his 
investors™ 
funds 
to pay his own personal expenses.
 27. For example, in September 2015, Hocker deposited checks from two 
investors
, total
ing $20,000
, into his James E. Hocker and Associates bank account.  
Days later, he used over $6,000 of those funds to pay his credit card bill, and over 
$4,000 to pay a 
local 
tax 
official
.  He also used those funds to write a $1,500 check 
to another invest
or, which was itself deceptive conduct in that such 
minor 
disbursements 
helped
 to conceal Hocker™s scheme
.  He spent the remaining money 
on restaurants, retail purchases, and spousal support for his ex
-wife. 
 28.  Similarly, from December 2015 through March 2016, Hocker 
received $262,000 in payments from investors.  He used over $24,000 of those 
funds to pay his credit card bills, over $
20,000 to send wire payments to his 
ex-wife, over $14,000 to repay personal loa
ns, and he spent over $3,000 at casinos.  In 
addition, Hocker used over $64,000 of those funds to make payments to other 
investors, or on their behalf
, again to conceal his fraud
.  The balance of the funds 
Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 9 of 13 10  was used for other expenses, such as restaurants, 
bill payments, retail purchases 
and tax payments.
 29. Hocker™s false representations to investors that he would invest their 
funds and generate returns, his false assurances to investors that their investments 
were performing well
, and 
other 
deceptive conduct,
 including 
his payment
s of 
small amounts to investors funded from other investors™ 
pooled 
deposits, 
providing 
investors with 
misleading 
S&P
 500 performance 
reports
, and 
false 
hand
written 
notes
 promising 
guaranteed 
and/or tax free 
returns
, were 
all 
undertaken 
in 
furtherance of his multi
-year fraudulent scheme to deceive investors and 
misappropriate investor funds for his personal use.
 30. Hocker™s investment scheme 
bears the hallmarks of 
a Ponzi scheme
.  For example, 
Hocker raised more
 than $1 million from investors through false 
statements and deceptive conduct;
 contrary to his representations to investors, 
he 
failed to invest their money or produce any 
profits
 for them
; and
 the source of 
payments to investors was cash infused by 
other
 investors.
   31. At all times, Hocker acted with
 scienter, kno
wing or reckless in not 
knowing
 that he 
misstated material facts to investors and 
was
 engaged
 in deceptive 
conduct

          Case 4:18-cv-01251-MWB   Document 1   Filed 06/21/18   Page 13 of 13"
93,93,"Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges and obtained an asset freeze against the individuals and companies behind a $102 million Ponzi scheme that bilked investors throughout the U.S.

According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants defrauded more than 600 investors through sales of securities in issuers they controlled, including First Nationle Solution LLC, United RL Capital Services, and Percipience Global Corp.  The complaint alleges that investors were told that their funds would be used for the companies and some were guaranteed dividends or double-digit returns.  But, according to the complaint, the defendants spent at least $20 million to enrich themselves, paid $38.5 million in Ponzi-like payments, and transferred much of the remainder in transactions that appear unrelated to the issuers' purported businesses.

Defendants Santillo and Parris buy or take over books of business of retiringinvestment professionals from around the country. Then Santillo and Parris, or local salespeople, including Defendants Piccarreto, LaRocco, and Brenner, persuade these newly acquiredclients Štheir victims Š to withdraw their savings from traditional investments and invest inissuers controlled by Santillo, Parris, or their associates, including Defendants First Nationle,Percipience, and United RL. The bulk of the more than $102 million raised in this fraud waspurportedly raised for these three issuers.2. Defendants falsely claim that their investors' money will be used to operatebusinesses in fields such as financial services, insurance, real estate development, and medicallaboratories. In fact, any business operations for each issuer appear to be limited or non-existent.After receiving investor funds, Defendants transfer those funds through multiple accounts held inthe names of different entities Defendants control, commingling the funds, then transfer thefunds elsewhere.3. As one example, Piccarreto met with an investor from Austin, Texas in February2015. Because the investor suffers from dementia and was nearly 80 years old at the time, hisdaughter attended the meeting as well. Piccarreto convinced the elderly investor to put $250,000in Percipience, describing it as areal-estate investment. On March 5, 2015, that money wasdeposited into Percipience's bank account, then promptly transferred through affiliate bankaccounts Šfrom which Piccarreto misappropriated $21,500 Šand through First Nationle's bankaccount Šfrom which Santillo misappropriated $172,800. More than two years later, after theinvestor's daughter expressed concern about his investments to Piccarreto, Piccarreto falselywrote in an e-mail, ""I know this is scary for you and you are just looking out for dad but Ipromise you I will not let anything happen to any of the money."" In fact, Defendants knew they2 were lying to investors and stealing their money. And this investor has never received anymoney back from his investment in Percipience.4. Defendants have enriched themselves greatly through the money they stole frominvestors. Santillo has misappropriated at least $13.4 million; Parris has misappropriated at least$1.1 million; LaRocco has misappropriated at least $1.1 million; Piccarreto has misappropriatedat least $1.3 million; and Brenner has misappropriated at least $2.9 million.As an example of Defendants' use of stolen investor funds, Santillo uses thatstolen money to fund ajet-setting lifestyle, including paying for housing in multiple states, carleases, expenditures at a country club and a Las Vegas resort and casino, credit card payments,and other personal expenses. At the same time he was misappropriating investor funds, Santillothrew himself a party at a nightclub in Las Vegas for which he commissioned a song abouthimself to be played. The lyrics to that song refer to (Perry) Santillo as ""King Perry"" anddescribe his typical attire: ""ten-thousand-dollar suit everywhere he rides."" The song also depictshis lifestyle as follows: ""pop the champagne in L.A., New York to Florida; buy another bottlejust to spray it all over ya.""6. Of the at least $102 million raised by Defendants, the majority of it was eithermisappropriated by Defendants or paid to redeeming investors in classic Ponzi-scheme fashion.VIOLATIONS7.

First Nationle purports to conductbusiness in areas including leveraged investments, the financial services industry, insurance, andreal estate development, among others. The Commission is not aware of evidence that indicatesthat First Nationle conducts more than some minimal business. Rather, Defendants operate FirstNationle primarily as a Ponzi scheme by issuing securities in the form of promissory notes,soliciting and then misappropriating substantial amounts of investor funds, and using remaininginvestor funds to pay off redeeming investors.20. Percipience is a Delaware Corporation. Percipience purports to conduct businessby providing loans to borrowers to buy and improve single-family houses. The Commission isnot aware of evidence that indicates that Percipience conducts more than some minimal business.Rather, Defendants operate Percipience primarily as a Ponzi scheme by issuing securities in theform of stock, soliciting and then misappropriating substantial amounts of investor funds, andusing remaining investor funds to pay off redeeming investors.21.

Santillo and Parris buy books of business from investment professionals around7 the country, then solicit investors from those books with the aid of the other IndividualDefendants. With investor victims located throughout the country, Santillo and Parris haverelied on individuals with long-established ties to, and trust within, certain communities todefraud investors in those communities. LaRocco has been a central figure in defraudinginvestors in Florida, where Santillo and LaRocco and potentially others raised at least $26million from at least 147 investors since August 2012. Piccarreto has been a central figure indefrauding investors in Texas, where Parris and Piccarreto and potentially others raised at least$6.6 million from at least 38 investors since Apri,12014.

In total, Defendants have raised at least $102 million from at least 637 investorssince at least July 2011 through their fraudulent offerings. Of that $102 million, the majority ofthe investor funds was either misappropriated by Defendants or paid to redeeming investors.The Fraudulent Offerings25. First Nationle: Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, and potentially others, haveinduced at least 318 investors to invest at least $46 million in the First Nationle offering sinceFebruary 2012. A First Nationle brochure provided to investors and potential investors claimsthat First Nationle is a holding company for ""several sales affiliates that represent a group of companies who offer a rich portfolio of premier Insurance and Impaired Risk products ...Thesesubsidiaries manage over $145 million in assets."" The Commission is not aware of anyevidence that indicates that First Nationle is a holding company for any subsidiaries, much lesssubsidiaries with assets of $145 million. The Commission is also not aware of any evidence thatindicates that First Nationle conducts anything more than minimal business functions.26. First Nationle's website claims that it ""is engaged in leveraging inveshnents,holdings, and other assets, while building value for investors."" First Nationle's operatingagreement claims it engages in businesses including ""the acquisition, ownership, development,preservation or operation of ...stock, mortgages, notes, receivables, securities and realty....""First Nationle's subscription agreement, which it provided to investors, claims that it is ""engagedin the business of senior market insurance program commerce and the development andmanagement of diverse real property holdings.""27. The subscription agreement describes the investment as follows: ""The debtorplans to apply the proceeds of the offering to help fund the debtor's outlined business model.""The subscription agreement further claims that ""[nJone of the proceeds from the offering willinure to the personal benefit of the Manager."" The First Nationle operating agreement providedto investors identifies Santillo as the manager of First Nationle, while the subscription agreementidentifies Lucian Global, LLC as manager. Parris is the manager of Lucian Global LLC, andthus a de facto co-manager of First Nationle along with Santillo.28. First Nationle offered promissory notes to investors. The promissory notesoffered and sold by Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, and Piccarreto typically contain maturity dates ofthree years, and provide for interest payments at an annual rate ranging from 3.3% to 6%, as wellas bonuses ranging from approximately 10% to 19% to be credited to the investor upon initially investing.29. Percipience: Santillo, Parris, Piccarreto, Brenner, and potentially others, haveinduced at least 229 investors to invest at least $22 million in the Percipience offering since July2012. A 2013 Percipience private placement memorandum (""PPM"") claims that Percipience'sbusiness is to provide loans to borrowers to buy and improve single-family houses. TheCommission is not aware of any evidence that indicates that Percipience conducts anything morethan minimal business functions. The PPM further claims that in the event of raising amaximum $S million in the offering, $4.25 million (or 85% of the proceeds) will be used forPercipience's business, with the remainder of the proceeds to be spent on expenses such as~,brokers fees.30. Percipience's program summary claims that its business includes ""(a) short-termproperly acquisition and resale, (b) purchase of distressed non-performing bank notes forprofitable repositioning, and (c) property rental income."" Percipience's operating agreementclaims that it ""shall purchase ...stand-alone homes or ...flats within amulti-family building""and ""lease residences to families supported by governmentally funded rent subsidies....""Percipience's private placement memorandum claims that it will ""will own, fund and operate [a]real-estate-financing business....""31. Percipience offered investors preferred stock, specifically Class A and Class Bshares. Class A shares have a one year ""lock period,"" with a claimed annual return of 7%. ClassB shares have a three year ""lock period,"" with a claimed annual return of 8%and an 8%bonus tobe credited to the investor upon initially investing.32. United RL: Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, Brenner, and potentially others,have induced at least 183 investors to invest at least $25 million in the United RL offering since10 March 2015. United RL's Operating Agreement describes Parris and LaRocco as members ofUnited RL. A United RL brochure and PPM claim that United RL's business is to make loans tophysicians or medical practices for the purpose of owning their own toxicology laboratories formedical tests. The Commission is not aware of any evidence that indicates that United RLconducts anything more than minimal business functions.33. United RL's website claims that it ""is asingular-disciplined company thatspecializes in providing Physician's financing, supporting the initial development phases ofPhysician owned clinical laboratories."" United RL's operating agreement claims that itsoperations ""encompass the direct or indirect (i) financing ofinedical-laboratory acquisitionsand/or operations owned by third parties, and (ii) conduct of all commercial operations relatedthereto or supportive thereof."" The United RL Brochure provided to investors states that UnitedRL ""provide[s] program financing ...for the following specialties: hospitals, OBGYN's painmanagement, internist and primary care physicians.""34. United RL offered promissory notes to investors. The promissory notes hadmaturity dates of either one year (""short term"") or three years (either ""medium term"" or ""longterm""). The terms of the notes include claimed 7% interest payments to be paid semi-annuallyand claimed bonus payments of 7% on the three-year promissory notes, to be credited to theinvestor upon initially investing.35. Other Fraudulent  Middlebury Development Corporation from at least 23 investors; (3) $1.1 million raised inLucian Development Corporation from at least 14 investors; and (4) $758,000 raised in Torr,LLC from at least 13 investors.The Misrepresentations, Omissions, Misappropriations, and Breaches of Fiduciary Duty36. The Defendants have misrepresented to investors and potential investors thatthe money they invest in First Nationle, Percipience, United RL, or other issuers, is used toconduct the purported business of each respective issuer. Investors are not told that Š in fact Š asignificant portion of investor proceeds is used to repay redeeming investors or aremisappropriated for personal use by Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, and Brenner.37. Rather than deposit investors' funds with the issuers to be used for businesspurposes, Defendants commingled investors' funds. After receiving investor funds, Defendantstransferred those funds through multiple accounts held in the names of different entitiesDefendants control (including but not limited to First Nationle, Percipience, and United RL) thentransfer the funds elsewhere. Substantial amounts of these funds are transferred to redeeminginvestors or to Santillo or the other Individual Defendants. In some cases, Santillo transferrednearly all of an investor deposit to himself. In other cases the transfers were more complex, withDefendants commingling investor funds in different accounts and transferring the moneyelsewhere, including to themselves and to redeeming investors.38. Of the at least $102 million that Defendants have raised from investors,Santillo has misappropriated at least $13.4 million. In addition to this $13.4 million, Santilloreceived additional money transfers totaling at least $12 million, which he did not keep, buttransferred back into the accounts held in the names of different entities Defendants control(including but not limited to First Nationle, Percipience, and United RL). Additionally, Parris12 has misappropriated at least $1.1 million; LaRocco has misappropriated at least $1.1 million;Piccarreto has misappropriated at least $1.3 million; and Brenner has misappropriated at least$2.9 million.39. Defendants also misrepresented to investors the ongoing performance Š or lackthereof Š of their investments. Defendants provided account statements to investors falselystating that their funds were invested in the issuers, falsely stating investment returns, and insome cases falsely stating that a bonus had been credited to their account. In certain cases,Defendants provided investors with bonus funds or interest payments. In other cases,Defendants provided redeeming investors with their all or part of their funds, with returns.These were Ponzi payments derived from new investor funds rather than actual investmentreturns. Defendants have failed to fulfill,the request of other investors to redeem theirinvestments.40. Of the at least $102 million raised by Defendants, at least $38.5 million waspaid to out to earlier investors in Ponzi payments, at least $20 million was transferred to personalbank accounts of the Individual Defendants, and a large portion of the remaining funds wastransferred elsewhere in transactions that do not appear related to the Entity Defendants'purported businesses.41. Each of the Individual Defendants acted as investment advisers. Santillopurchased at least several investment advisory businesses, and then continued the business ofthose investment advisers, acting as an investment adviser himself. In addition to purchasinginvestment advisory businesses, Santillo advised clients regarding securities. He receivedcompensation through the misappropriation of investor funds. Additionally, Parris, Piccarreto,LaRocco, and Brenner presented themselves to investors as investment advisers who were acting13 in the interests of individual investors; they reviewed investors' portfolios of investments;provided investment advice regarding investments in securities; and they each receivedcompensation through misappropriated investor funds.42. The Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to theinvestors when they failed to use investor funds as they represented they would, and when theyfailed to inform investors that they were misappropriating their funds. In short, the IndividualDefendants failed to put their customers' interests before their own.Specific Misrepresentations and Omissions to Investors 1-743. Investors 1 and 2: In July 2014, Parris and Piccarreto met with Investors 1 and2, a husband and wife from Cedar Crest, New Mexico, to discuss investment opportunities.Parris and Piccarreto described two opportunities for investment: (1) First Nationle, which theyclaimed to be an investment related to commercial real estate; and (2) Percipience, which theyclaimed to be an investment related to residential real estate. Parris and Piccarreto told Investors1 and 2 that invested funds would be used to conduct the business of each respective issuer.Parris and Piccarreto also provided written documents related to the offerings. Parris andPiccarreto presented themselves as investment experts and recommended that Investors 1 and 2invest in First Nationle and Percipience.44. After meeting with Parris and Piccarreto, Investor 1 invested $76,000 inPercipience and Investor 2 invested $125,000 in Percipience. Investor 2 also invested $233,000in First Nationle. Parris described these as safe investments for athree-year term. Investors 1and 2 expected to receive their investments back, with interest, in July 2017. But to date theirinvestments have not Ueen repaid.45. An analysis of bank records shows that Investors 1 and 2's investments in14 Percipience were not used to conduct its purported business: Rather, some of the funds were usedto make payments to what appears to be another investor, while other funds weremisappropriated by Parris. Investors 1 and 2's investments in Percipience were placed into aPercipience bank account (with a previous balance of about $450), combined with anotherinvestor deposit of $20,000, then transferred among a variety of accounts not belonging toPercipience, including the accounts of First Nationle, and a manager of First Nationle. Themajority of those funds were then used to pay what appears to be another investor, while Parrisreceived $15,000.46. Similarly, Investor 2's investment in First Nationle was not used to conduct itspurported business. Rather, some of the funds were misappropriated by Santillo while otherfunds were paid to associates or entities controlled by associates of the Individual Defendants.Specifically, Investor 2's investment in First Nationle was placed into a First Nationle bankaccount (with a previous balance of about $57,000), combined with other investor deposits ofabout $530,000, then $480,000 was transferred to Santillo. Santillo misappropriated $100,000 ofthose funds, and transferred the remaining $370,000 back to the First Nationle account, fromwhich it was used to pay other investors.47. Investor 3 and leis daughter: In February 2015, Piccarreto met with Investor 3 Šwho suffers from dementia Šand his daughter at their home in Austin, Texas to discussinvestment opportunities. Piccarreto described an opportunity to invest in Percipience, which hetold Investor 3 was an investment in real estate. Piccarreto claimed that invested funds would beused to conduct the business of Percipience. Piccarreto wrote in an e-mail to Investor 3'sdaughter: ""I can generate enough interest (dividend payments) to cover [your father's] rent .. .while not touching the principal.... We will not be making double digit returns but we will also15 not have the risk of the stock market. We will have a fixed guaranteed dividend that will serve asincome to take care of expenses."" Piccarreto also provided written documents related to theoffering.48. After meeting with Piccarreto in 2015, Investor 3 invested $250,000 inPercipience under his daughter's name. Later, in June 2017, Piccarreto again met with Investor 3and his daughter to discuss additional investment opportunities. Subsequently, Piccarreto visitedInvestor 3 alone and obtained a $60,000 check from him, despite knowing of his dementia. Afterlearning that Piccarreto had done this, Investor 3's daughter asked for written documentation.about this new investment.. Piccarreto provided a brief document by e-mail, in which he stated ""Iknow this is scary for you and you are just looking out for dad but I promise you I will not letanything happen to any of the money."" Investor 3 and his daughter then decided not to goforward with this new investment. However, Piccarreto had already cashed the $60,000 check Šwhich had been made out to United RL.49. Investor 3 and his daughter asked for a refiind of their investment, but most of themoney has not been refunded. In late January 2018, Investor 3 received a $10,000 check fromPiccarreto. The check was drawn on an account of a third-party company unknown to Investor 3and his daughter. Investor 3's daughter called Piccarreto to ask where the rest of her father'smoney was, and Piccarreto said he did not know.50. An analysis of bank records shows that Investor 3's investment in Percipiencewas not used to conduct its purported business. Rather, a large portion of the funds weremisappropriated by Santillo and Piccarreto. Investor 3's investment in Percipience was placedinto a Percipience bank account (with a previous balance of about $717), combined with anotherinvestor deposit of $200,000, then transferred among a variety of accounts not belonging to16 Percipience, including the accounts of First Nationle and a manager of First Nationle. Santilloreceived $172,000 of those funds, while Piccarreto received $5,000, and some of the remainingfunds were transferred to accounts of other entities controlled by Santillo and his associates.51. Investors 4 and 5: In July 2016 Investors 4 and 5, a husband and wife fromSalinas, California, learned from their financial advisor that he had sold his wealth managementbusiness to Santillo. The financial advisor introduced Investors 4 and 5 to Santillo, and anotherindividual who worked with Santillo. In November 2016, Santillo and Piccarreto met withInvestors 4 and 5 to discuss investment opportunities. Santillo and Piccarreto described twoopportunities for investment: (1) First Nationle, which they claimed to be an investment relatedto real estate; and (2) United RL, which they claimed was a company related to the medical field.Santillo and Piccarreto claimed the funds Investor 4 and 5 invested would be used to conduct thebusiness of each respective issuer. Santillo and Piccarreto also provided written documentsrelated to the offerings.52. After meeting with Santillo and Piccarreto, Investor 4 invested $217,000 in FirstNationle and $217,000 in United RL. Investor 4 also invested $233,000 in First Nationle. InFebruary 2017, Investor 5 invested $124,000 in First Nationle. Also in February 2017, Investors4 and 5 agreed to place an additional approximately $168,000 in their self-directed IRA accountsand decide where to invest that money at a later date. But in August 2017 they learned that themoney had been taken from their self-directed IRA accounts and invested without theirpermission, 50% in First Nationle and 50% in United RL. Thereafter, Investors 4 and 5requested a refund of their money and Piccarreto claimed they would get their money back inDecember 2017. To date Investors 4 and 5 have received $75,000 back, but have not receivedthe remainder of their investments.17 53. Investor 6: During 2016, LaRocco met with Investor 6 from Ocklawaha, Floridato discuss investment opportunities. Through LaRocco, Investor 6's father had previouslyinvested approximately $510,000 in First Nationle. After Investor 6's father passed away,LaRocco provided advice and guidance to Investor 6 about her father's assets. LaRoccoconvinced Investor 6 to maintain her father's investment in First Nationle and also to invest$450,000 of her own money in United RL. LaRocco told Investor 6 that her investment fundswould be used for United RL's business of funding medical laboratories. LaRocco also providedwritten documents related to the offerings.54. After several meetings with LaRocco, Investor 6 invested $450,000 in United RLin in several installments between July and September 2016. Since that time, Investor 6 hasasked to redeem her investments, but she has only received payments totaling about $89,000.55. An analysis of bank records shows that Investor 6's investment in United RL wasnot used to conduct its purported business. Rather, some of the funds were used to makepayments to other investors, while other funds were misappropriated by Santillo. For example,$100,000 of Investor 6's investment in United RL was placed into a United RL bank account(with a previous balance of about $41,000), combined with approximately $420,000 of otherinvestor funds, and over the course of two days, about $210,000 were "
95,95,"On June 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Dallas-based oil-and-gas company and its chief executive officer in connection with a series of allegedly fraudulent unregistered oil-and-gas securities offerings that raised millions of dollars from investors.

In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Jefferey Gordon and Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC (TCEC) cold-called investors across the country, soliciting their interest in financing the drilling and completion of oil-and-gas prospects in Kansas and Texas in exchange for a share of future oil-and-gas production revenue. According to the complaint, Gordon and TCEC used a combination of false and misleading offering materials and sales pitches to deceive investors. Among other things, Gordon and TCEC lied to investors about TCEC's experience and track record, the advice and success rate of its geologists, the potential reserves on its prospects, the potential return on investments therein, and the manner in which TCEC would use investor funds. Ultimately, Gordon and TCEC raised more than $8 million from at least 80 investor victims. While investors lost almost every dollar invested, TCEC and Gordon misappropriated over $2.6 million of investor funds for their own use.

The SEC's office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert describing 10 red flags that an unregistered offering may be a scam, many of which were present here.

The SEC's complaint charges TCEC and Gordon with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also charged Gordon with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act based on his alleged role as an unregistered broker. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, TCEC and Gordon consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating these provisions. TCEC and Gordon also agreed to be restrained and enjoined from certain activities in connection with the purchase, offer and sale of securities in the future. Additionally, TCEC and Gordon will be ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling $7.2 million. Finally, Gordon has offered to consent to associational and penny stock bars.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Christopher Reynolds and Melvin Warren, with assistance from Joseph Dugan and Janie Frank, and supervised by Scott F. Mascianica, David Reece and Eric R. Werner."," IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

   COMPLAINT 
 Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commissi
on (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) files this Complaint 
against Defendants Texas Coastal Energy Comp
any, LLC (ﬁTCECﬂ) and Jefferey A. Gordon 
(ﬁGordonﬂ) (collectively ﬁDefendantsﬂ), and alleges as follows: I. SUMMARY   1. From early 2013 through November 2014, TC
EC and Gordon defrauded at least 80 investors out of more than $8 million in c
onnection with various unregistered securities 
offerings conducted for the purported purpose of drilling oil and gas wells.  TCEC and Gordon generally solicited investors from multiple states and lured them to invest in the unregistered 

offerings, using a combination of high-pressure tactics, deceptive sales pitches, and false and 

misleading offering materials.   
2. TCEC™s sales representatives cold-called investors across the country to sell TCEC™s various offerings.  Gordon created the content for the sales pitches and personally participated in some of the sales calls with 
investors.  During these calls, Gordon advised                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 1 of 15   PageID 1 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 2 
prospective investors on the merits of the offering
 without being registered as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered broker-dealer. 
 Additionally, Gordon and TCEC™s other sales representatives made false and misleading statemen
ts about TCEC™s track re
cord of profitability, the success and background of TCEC™s geologists, and the viability of TCEC™s oil-and-gas projects.      3. Gordon drafted, reviewed, and edited TCEC™s offering materials, including 
project brochures and Confidential Informa
tion Memoranda (ﬁCIMsﬂ).  Gordon and TCEC 
provided these materials to prospe
ctive investors.  The materials 
contained materially false and 
misleading representations about: (i) TCEC™s expe
rience in the oil-and-gas industry; (ii) the advice and success rate of TCEC™s geologists; (iii) the potential oil reserves on TCEC™s prospects; (iv) the potential return on investments on TCEC™s pr
ojects; (v) the manner in which 
TCEC would offer its JV interests; and (vi) the manner in whic
h TCEC would use funds raised from investors.  Furthermore, in offering materi
als for two projects, Gordon altered a geologist™s structure map to make the projects look more de
sirable.  TCEC and Gordon misappropriated and 
misused at least $2.66 million of the funds they rais
ed from investors, while
 investors lost all of the money they invested.   
4. By reason of these activities and the conduct described in more detail below, 
Defendants TCEC and Gordon have violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities la
ws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Ac
tﬂ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Similarly, 
Defendant Gordon has violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate the broker                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 2 of 15   PageID 2 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 3 
registration requirements of the federal secur
ities laws, specifically Section 15(a) of the 
Exchange Act.   5. In the interest of protecting the public from any further fraudulent activity and 
harm, the Commission brings this action agains
t the Defendants and seeks permanent injunctive 
relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains resulti
ng from Defendants™ violations of the federal 
securities laws, accrued prejudgmen
t interest on those ill-gotten
 gains, and civil monetary 
penalties.        II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 6. Defendants offered and sold securities in the forms of units of purported joint 
venture (ﬁJVﬂ) interests to investors and prospective investors.  The JV interests are investment 
contracts and therefore securities under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77b] and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78c].  As such, the Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 
U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78(aa)].   7. Venue is proper because a substantial part
 of the events and omissions giving rise 
to the claims alleged herein occurred within th
e Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division.  TCEC maintained its headquarters and principal 
place of business in Dallas, Texas, and Gordon 
resides in Dallas, Texas.

Commission.  From the time Gordon co-founded TCEC
 in 2011, he used it to conduct oil-and-gas-related securitie
s offerings.     9. Jefferey A. Gordon, age 37, currently resides in Dallas, Texas.  Gordon is the co-owner, Chief Executive Officer, and control person of TCEC.  IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 A. TCEC™s Business Operations  10. TCEC™s business model involved raising cap
ital for the purpose of financing the drilling and completion of oil-and-gas prospect
s, in hopes of profiting from the subsequent 
production from those prospects.  TCEC did not se
ll its own securities to raise this capital.  Rather, TCEC created a JV for each offering and ra
ised capital from investors through the sale of 
ﬁturnkeyﬂ JV interests in the specific JVs.  Investors made a lump sum investment in an offering 
associated with a given oil-and-gas prospect, wh
ich would cover the estimated costs for drilling 
and completing a well.  TCEC then bore the ri
sk of any cost overruns.  TCEC served as 
Managing Venturer for each JV it created, 
and Gordon personally handled many of the 
management responsibilities for the JVs.     
11. TCEC purportedly granted each JV certain
 mineral rights it already owned in the 
prospects.  Individual investors acquired an interest in the JV 
by virtue of purchasing the JV™s securities, denominated in individual units.  TC
EC purported to use the capital raised from 
investors to drill, test, and complete various we
lls.  Thereafter, TCEC and its investors were to share in production revenue generated by these wells.   
12. TCEC purchased the leasing rights for tw
o properties: (1) the Schlegel Field in 
Rush County, Kansas (the ﬁSchlegel Prospectﬂ) from Kansas Petroleum Resources, LLC 
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 4 of 15   PageID 4 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 5 
(ﬁKPRﬂ) in 2011; and (2) the North Page Prospect (ﬁNPPﬂ) in Schleicher County, Texas from 
Patrick Fairchild (ﬁFairchildﬂ) in 2013.   
13. TCEC conducted the following offerings in connection with the Schlegel Field and the NPP between February 2013 and November 2014:  
 TCEC Schlegel #6 JV (ﬁSCH6ﬂ);   TCEC Schlegel #7 JV (ﬁSCH7ﬂ);   Texas Coastal Energy West Texas #1 JV (ﬁWT1ﬂ); and  Texas Coastal Energy West Texas #2 JV (ﬁWT2ﬂ)  (collectively referred to as
 the ﬁSubject Offeringsﬂ). 
14. Rod Andersen (ﬁAndersenﬂ) of KPR served as TCEC™s geologist for SCH6 and 
SCH7, and Fairchild served as TCEC™s geologist for WT1.  TCEC had no geologist for WT2.  
Both Andersen and Fairchild prepared written geological summaries or overviews for the Schlegel Field and NPP, respectively, a
nd provided those to Gordon and TCEC.   
B. TCEC Sales Process and JV Agreements 
15. To market and sell the JV interests, 
TCEC maintained boiler rooms of sales 
employees in Dallas, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.
  TCEC marketed the JV interests for all of 
the Subject Offerings through unsolicited cold calls to thousands of potential investors whose contact information they obtained from lead lists
.  TCEC did not limit its sale of interests to 
investors with experience in, or knowledge of, the oil-and-gas industry.  In fact, several investors had no prior experience at all investing in oil and gas projects.  Throughout the process, Gordon and TCEC offered and sold JV interests in the Subject Offerings using the means or instruments 
of interstate commerce, including but not limited to telephones, the internet, commercial 
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 5 of 15   PageID 5 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 6 
couriers, wires, and the mails.  No
 valid registration was ever filed or was in effect in connection with the Defendants™ offer and sale of the JV interests.   
16. Gordon gave TCEC™s sales staff details about the offerings, which they used in their phone calls to solicit inve
stors.  Additionally, Gordon pe
rsonally solicited investors by 
phone to purchase JV interests in the Subject Offerings, advising prospective investors on the merits of the investments.  While performing th
ese activities, Gordon was not registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission or affiliate
d with a broker-dealer registered with the 
Commission. 
17. When prospective investors expressed interest in a TCEC project, TCEC sent them written materials, which generally include
d a project brochure, a CIM, a JV Agreement 
(ﬁJVAﬂ), and an application agreement (together th
e ﬁOffering Materialsﬂ).  Gordon drafted, edited, reviewed, and approved the Offering Materials.  One of TCEC™s sales representatives then scheduled a closing call with prospective investors.   18. Investors in the Subject Offerings executed a JVA that effectively stripped them 
of all management powers.  The JVAs explicitly
 appointed TCEC as the Managing Venturer for 
each respective JV and vested TCEC with exclus
ive authority to take the following actions on 
behalf of the JVs: (i) investigate and evaluate investment opportunitie
s; (ii) retain or act as an operator; (iii) execute agreements 
that would bind the JV; (iv) take and hold title to property on behalf of the JV; (v) utilize JV funds to protect and preserve any 
prospect well; and (iv) sign for, 
or bind, the JV with respect to its operations.   19. Further, because of the way TCEC struct
ured the Subject Offerings, investors had no power to manage the affairs of each JV™s project
s.  Investors in the Subject Offerings lacked 
knowledge of the identity of and contact information for other investors, and therefore would 
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 6 of 15   PageID 6 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 7 
have been unable to exercise their limited pow
er as joint venturers to replace TCEC as the 
Managing Venturer of the JVs, if they chose to do so.     
20. TCEC also comingled the funds from a
ll of the Subject Offerings into bank accounts owned and controlled by Gordon.  Accordingl
y, if the investors in a particular JV voted to remove TCEC as the Managing Venturer, they
 would have had no control over that JV™s cash assets. 
21. TCEC ultimately raised more than $8 m
illion from at least 80 investors from at 
least 28 states for the Subject Offerings.  Yet, Gordon, who controlled TCEC™s bank accounts, 

caused TCEC to spend less than $1.2 million dr
illing the wells for the SCH6, SCH7, and WT1 
projects.  TCEC did not drill any we
lls for the WT2 project.      C. TCEC™s Written Material Misrepresentations to Investors 
22. The Offering Materials that TCEC and Gordon circulated to investors contained numerous misrepresentations about
: (i) TCEC™s experience in the oil-and-gas industry; (ii) the advice and success rate of its geologists; (iii) the potential oil re
serves on the Schlegel Field and the NPP; (iv) the potential return on investment
s for TCEC™s projects; 
(v) the manner in which 
TCEC would offer its JV interests; and (vi) the manner in whic
h TCEC would use funds raised from investors.   
23. For example, all of the CIMs for the Subject Offerings included the representation 
that ﬁ[n]o general solicitation–shall be employed 
in the offering of the [JV] units[.]ﬂ  This 
representation was false because, as detailed 
above, TCEC engaged in widespread general 
solicitation when selling JV inte
rests for the Subject Offerings. 24. The brochures for all of the Subject Offerings represented that TCEC™s ﬁhuman 
capitalﬂ included 200 years of drilling and exploration experience. 
 In reality, TCEC™s executives 
and employees had nowhere close to 200 years of
 experience in the oil-and-gas industry.                                                                                             Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 7 of 15   PageID 7 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 8 
25. The SCH6 and SCH7 brochures both repres
ented that: (i) the Schlegel Field had projected cumulative reserves of 500,000 to three m
illion barrels of oils; (ii) the wells for the 
respective projects had production potential of 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day (ﬁBOPDﬂ); and (iii) the respective wells would potentially provide investors a return of 300% to 500%.  However, the geological analysis provided to TCEC and Gordon for the Schlegel Field predicted 
that the Schlegel Field had potential reserves of a maximum 
of 450,000 barrels of oil and that initial production from the SCH6 and SCH7
 wells would be approximately 50 BOPD.  
Additionally, TCEC and Gordon knew that Anderson, the geologist, did not anticipate a 300% to 500% return for either the SCH6 or the SCH7 well.      
26. The SCH6 and SCH7 brochures also mi
srepresented Anderson™s history and success as a geologist.  Both brochures stated that Anderson: (i) generated, evaluated, marketed, drilled, completed, and/or managed more than 5
00 oil-and-gas wells; (ii)
 drilled and developed five million barrels of oil and more than one-half 
trillion cubic feet of gas; and (ii) had a 93% 
geological success rate in Rush County, Kansas.  None of these statements was true, and Gordon 
and TCEC knew that Anderson never relayed any such information to Gordon or any else at 
TCEC. 
27. The WT2 CIM represented that TCEC would 
pay that JV™s share of the costs to 
drill and test one well bore for the WT2 well and pay all organizational costs pertaining thereto, all for an aggregate fixed price to the JV of up to $1,727,100.  TCEC and Gordon, however, never intended to, and never did, procure or pay for any services rela
ting to the drilling and testing of any wells for the WT2 project. 
28. The WT2 brochure represented that: (i) 
the WT2 well would have a production 
potential of 100 to 200 BOPD and 100,000-plus barrels of oil cumu
latively; and (ii) Fairchild 
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 8 of 15   PageID 8 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 9 
helped TCEC pinpoint its current prospects in West Texas based on highly attractive features, 
such as productive offset wells, multiple ﬁpay 
zones,ﬂ and the potential
 to profit from both 
substantial oil and natura
l gas deposits.  In reality, the WT
2 well did not have this production potential.  Additionally, Fairchild was not retain
ed as a geologist for the WT2 offering and did 
not help TCEC pick the location for the WT2.  In
 fact, Fairchild thought it would be a waste of funds to drill the WT2 well.  
29. At the time TCEC and Gordon disseminated
 the offering materials for the Subject Offerings to investors, they knew, or at least were severely reckless in not knowing, that the forgoing representations were false and misleading. 
D. TCEC™s and Gordon™s Verbal 
Misrepresentations to Investors
 30. TCEC and Gordon also made several mate
rial misrepresentations about TCEC™s 
operations and performance in telephonic commun
ications with investors between February 2013 and November 2014.  TCEC™s salespeople,
 using information provided by Gordon, told 
potential investors that TCEC™s most recen
t project was returning $4,000 to $5,000 per month on 
a $50,000 investment.  In reality, none of TCEC™s
 projects provided this amount of return on a 
$50,000 investment. 
31.   Gordon also personally told potential investors that Fairchild: (1) had accumulated $125 million worth of oil-and-gas leas
es; (2) owned 400 oil we
lls; (3) had drilled and been responsible for more than 1,000 wells, 400 of which were still producing oil and gas; and (4) had a hit rate of 90%.  None of these statements was tr
ue, and Fairchild never relayed any such information to Gordon or anyone at TCEC. 
 
                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 9 of 15   PageID 9 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 10 
E.  TCEC™s and Gordon™s Misu
se of Offering Proceeds
 32. The WT1 and WT2 CIMs both represente
d that TCEC would use the money 
raised to pay for drilling, testing, and comple
tion services on the subject wells.  The CIMs further represented that TCEC would be lim
ited in the funds it r
eceived from the JV.  
Specifically, TCEC represented th
at it would only receive a sma
ll administrative services fee 
reimbursement each month (a maximum of $1,
000).  Otherwise, TCEC would only receive money after prospects were completed, with that
 amount to be the difference between the money 
raised and the amount spent on drilling, 
testing, and completion services.   
33. TCEC and Gordon raised more than $4 millio
n to drill the wells
 associated with 
WT1 and WT2.  However, TCEC failed to pay for 
all the services it procured to drill the WT1 
well and never drilled the WT2 well.  Instead, 
TCEC and Gordon used the money raised for 
these two projects in ways that were inconsistent with TCEC™s repr
esentations in the CIMs.  At a minimum, TCEC and Gordon misappropriated an
d misused at least $2.66 million in investor 
funds raised for WT1 and WT2.   
34. Furthermore, even though TCEC spent le
ss than $1.2 million in expenses relating 
to drilling, testing, and comp
leting the SCH6, SCH7, and WT
1 wells, Gordon, contrary to TCEC™s representations, distributed more than 
$1.9 million of investor 
funds to himself during 
this time period, thereby obtai
ning money or property by mean
s of untrue statements or 
omissions of material fact.  
35. By comparison, although the WT1 produced
 some production revenue, the total lease operating expenses associated with WT1 were
 more than the revenue earned on the project.  
Consequently, investors did not receive any return
 on their investment.  Investors in WT2 (along 
with the SCH6 and SCH7) received no re
turn on their investment.      
                                                                                          Case 3:18-cv-01587-K   Document 1   Filed 06/19/18    Page 10 of 15   PageID 10 SEC v. Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC, et al. 
COMPLAINT               Page 11 
F. Defendants™ Scheme to Defraud Investors 36. TCEC and Gordon engaged in a variety of deceptive practices to create the impression that their prospects we
re more promising than they act
ually were.  For example, they 
incorporated Fairchild™s NPP Structure Map in 
the WT1 and WT2 brochures.  To make the WT1 
and WT2 offerings look more attr
active, TCEC and Gordon removed 
six dry holes that Fairchild had indicated on the map.  The WT1 and WT2 br
ochures also included decline curves that 
visually depicted the production rates for these wells.  These decline curves, however, were 
inaccurate and gave the false impression that in
vestors would recoup their investment capital 4.5 
times quicker than what TCEC and 
Gordon knew Fairchild anticipated.   37. TCEC also hosted live presentations in Texas and California where it pitched investors on the opportunities to invest in the Subject Offerings.  During these presentations, Gordon served as TCEC™s primary spokesman 
and misrepresented TCEC™s background and 
experience in the oil-and-gas industry to potential investors. 38. TCEC™s sales representatives also sent em
ails to potential investors containing the 
false CIMs and false claims about the Subject Offerings. 
39. All of these practices by TCEC and Gordon were done intentionally with the principal purpose of creating a false app
earance to deceive potential investors.

96,96,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Vancouver-based Chartered Professional Accountant with illegally trading in the securities of a Canadian oil and gas company, using non-public information he obtained while working for a member of the company's board of directors.

The SEC's complaint alleges that in May 2016, while working as an accountant and personal assistant for a director of InterOil Corporation, Kurt J. Bordian received e-mail messages indicating that the company was entering into a merger agreement in which its stock would be acquired at a significant premium. The complaint alleges that, shortly before the merger announcement, Bordian purchased out-of-the-money InterOil call options with near-term expiration dates, which meant that Bordian stood to profit only if InterOil's stock price rose significantly shortly after he acquired the options. As alleged in the complaint, following the merger announcement, InterOil's stock price increased over 37% percent, and Bordian sold the InterOil options contracts, making illicit profits of $220,500.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, charges Bordian with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Bordian consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $220,500, prejudgment interest of $14,358, and a civil penalty of $220,500. Bordian also consented to a Commission order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian T. Fitzsimons and supervised by Brian O. Quinn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

  : _______________________________________________  :  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges:
  SUMMARY
  1. This case involves unlawful insider trading by 
Kurt 
J. 
Bordian
 in the securities of 
InterOil Corporation (ﬁInterOilﬂ)
, a Canadian 
oil and gas 
company
 that 
had 
securities registered 
with the Commission and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  
In 
May 2016
, Bordian
, an 
accountant and personal assistant 
for a member of InterOil™s board of directors,
 traded on 
material nonpublic information 
that 
InterOil
, which had 
operat
ions 
primarily in 
Papua New 
Guinea
, was 
entering into an agreement to be 
acquired
 by Oil 
Search Limited
 (ﬁOil Searchﬂ)
, a 
Papua New Guinea
 based oil and gas company
.   Case 2:18-cv-10437   Document 1   Filed 06/12/18   Page 1 of 8 PageID: 1 2  2. As a result of his 
work for the InterOil director 
in May 2016, 
Bordian 
knew of the 
material terms of the acquisition agreement, 
including that the 
proposed 
purchase price 
was at
 a  significant premium to the recent market price of InterOil stock.  
In breach of 
his 
duty of trust 
and confidence
, Bordian 
traded on this 
material nonpublic information 
about the proposed 
acquisition.  
On May 18 and 19
, 2016, Bordian
 purchased 
in 
his
 personal account 
290 out-of-the
-money
 call option
 contracts
 for InterOil stock
, all of which had 
near term 
expiration dates.  
To be 
exercised profitably, 
the 
market 
price of InterOil stock
 had 
to 
increase significantly 
prior to the 
expiration dates, some 
of which 
expired on May 20
.   3. As Bordian knew would occur, 
after the close of the market 
on May 19, 2016, 
InterOil and Oil Search 
publicly announced th
ey had entered into
 an 
acquisition
 agreement
, which valued InterOil stock at approximately $40.25 per sha
re.  
Following th
is public 
announcement, 
the market price of InterOil stock increased 
over 
37% 
percent
, clos
ing
 at 
$43.58 per share 
on May 20
, 2016
.  That day, and during the weeks following the announcement
, Bordian sold all 
of 
the 
InterOil 
options contra
cts 
he had just acquired
, making 
illicit profits 
of 
$220,500.   4. By engaging in the conduct alleged in this Complaint, 
Bordian
 violated the 
antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b)
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) 
[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] 
and Rule 10b
-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b
-5].  The Commission seeks 
in this action a permanent injunction, disgorgement with pre
judgment interest, 
a civil penalty
, and an officer
-and
-director bar
.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE

tion under Section
s 21(d) and 21A of the Exchange 
Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u

      Case 2:18-cv-10437   Document 1   Filed 06/12/18   Page 3 of 8 PageID: 3 4  FACTS
 12. At all 
times 
relevant 
to this complaint, 
InterOil was a
 Canadian 
oil and gas 
company that operated primar
ily in Papu
a New Guinea.  The company™s common shares were 
registered 
with the Commission 
and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 13. At all times rel
evant 
to 
this complaint, Bordian worked as a
n accountant and a 
personal assistant to a
 member of 
InterOil™s 
board of directors.
  Bordian
, who ha
d worked 
personally for the InterOil director 
for over
 ten
 years
, owed a 
duty of trust and confidence
 to the 
InterOil 
director
.         14. In 2015
, the InterOil Director 
was in an accident and 
suffered a 
serious 
spinal 
injury
 that left him 
physically incapacitated
.  While 
the InterOil 
director recover
ed, Bordian 
assisted
 him 
with 
emails, includ
ing
 printing and 
helpi
ng him read 
copies 
of emails.
  The InterOil 
director made 
special 
arrangements 
at 
InterOil
 so 
that 
Bordian 
was 
copied on emails to the 
InterOil 
director.  The InterOil 
director 
and 
Bordian 
discussed 
the 
confidential nature of th
is 
arrangement, and 
Bordian 
agreed to keep the 
information 
in the InterOil 
emails 
strictly 
confidential.        
   15. In May 2016, 
Bordian 
received
 copies of 
InterOil 
emails to the InterOil 
director.  
At the time, InterOil and Oil Search were 
engaged 
in 
confidential acquisition negotiations, which 
had begun in March 2016.  
The emails to the InterOil 
director 
that Bordian 
received 
included 
confidential emails 
about the 
ongoing acquisition negotiations.  
   16. By mid
-May, InterOil 
and Oil Search were 
finalizin
g the terms of an acquisition 
agreement.  
On May 18, 2016, Bordian received 
copies of emails to the 
InterOil 
director
 that 
contain
ed the material terms of 
the proposed 
agreement
 pursuant to which 
Oil Search would 
acquire 
InterOil
.  The 
agreement valued 
Int
erOil stock at approximately 
$40.25 per share
, which 
Case 2:18-cv-10437   Document 1   Filed 06/12/18   Page 4 of 8 PageID: 4 5  represented a
 more than
 28% premium 
over 
the 
most recent 
closing 
market price of InterOil 
stock.  Bordian knew t
his information about 
InterOil™s 
pending 
acquisition 
was 
both 
material and 
nonpublic information.  
 17. In breach of his duty of trust 
and confidence to the InterOil D
irector, Bordian 
traded on 
this 
material nonpublic information 
concerning the pending acquisition of InterOil.  
On 
May 18
 and 19
, 2016, Bordian purchased
 in his personal brokerage account 
the following 
securities:  
40 InterOil call 
option contracts
 with a 
$35 strike price and an expiration date of May 
27, 2016; 100 InterOil call option
 contracts 
with a 
$35 strike price and an expiration date of June 
3, 2016; 100 InterOil call option contracts with a 
$33.50 
strike price and an expiration date of 
May 20, 2016; and 50 InterOil call option contracts with a 
$33 strike price and an expiration date 
of May 
20, 2016.  The total cost of these options contracts was 
$5,750. 18. All of the
se InterOil 
option contracts were 
purchased 
ﬁout of the money,ﬂ 
meaning the market price 
of 
InterOil stock was 
below 
the 
strike price
s in the contracts.  
To 
exercise the options profitably, 
the market price of InterOil stock
 had to 
rise above
 the strike
s price 
prior 
to 
the 
expiration
 dates
, which for some contracts was the very next day
 Œ May 20
, 2016.     19. As Bordian knew would 
occur
, after the close of the market 
on May 19, 2016
, InterOil and 
Oil Search 
publicly announced 
the acquisition agreement.  
Under the terms of the 
proposed 
$2.2 billion 
acquisition, InterOil shareholders would receive approximately 
$40.25 per 
share, which represented a significant premium over the recent market price
 of InterOil stock
.  Following th
e public announcement, the market price of InterOil stock increased over 37% 
percent, closing at 
$43.58 per share on May 20, 2016.  That day
, and during the weeks following 
Case 2:18-cv-10437   Document 1   Filed 06/12/18   Page 5 of 8 PageID: 5 6  the public announcement,
 Bordian sold all of the InterOil options contracts he had 
rec
ently
 acquired
, making illicit profits of 
$220,500.   CLAIM FOR RELIEF

101,101,"On May 16, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Brent Borland and two of his companies with misappropriating close to $6 million in investor funds intended to finance an international airport in Belize.

The SEC's complaint alleges that between 2014 and 2017, Brent Borland sold more than $21 million of promissory notes to dozens of investors, promising that the funds would be used as bridge financing for development of an international airport in Placencia, Belize and that the investments would be protected by pledges of real estate as collateral. Borland marketed and sold the notes through two companies, Borland Capital Group LLC, which purports to be active in ""alternative investment,"" and Belize Infrastructure Fund I, LLC, which purports to be in the business of construction finance.

The complaint alleges that Borland used millions of dollars of investor funds for personal expenses and unrelated business expenses, including mortgage and property tax payments on his family's Florida mansion, multiple luxury automobiles, private school tuition for his children, $36,000 for his family's beach club membership, and almost $2.7 million to pay off credit cards. Borland also allegedly deceived investors by pledging the same collateral to multiple investors.

The SEC's complaint filed in the Southern District of New York alleges that Borland, BCG and Belize Fund with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks, among other relief, asset freezes as to Borland and his companies, an accounting of investor assets, disgorgement of Borland's ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. The complaint also names as relief defendants Borland's wife, Alana LaTorra Borland, and a corporation controlled by Borland and his wife, Canyon Acquisitions, LLC. The SEC seeks to recover investor proceeds that Borland transferred to the relief defendants.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Borland who was arrested earlier in the day. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by Andrew O'Brien and Donald Ryba and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC's litigation will be led by Benjamin Hanauer and Timothy Leiman."," JUDGE S~'~,Benjamin J. Hanauer (pending pro hac vice)Timothy S. Leiman (pending pro hac vice)Andrew P.

( )JiiRY DEMANDEDPlaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"" or""Commission"") alleges as follows:~~521. This case centers on a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by Defendant Brent Borlandthrough two entities that he owned and controlled: (1) Borland Capital Group, LLC (""BCG"") and(2) Belize Infrastructure Fund I, LLC (""Belize Fund"").Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 1 of 22 
     2. Although Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund (collectively, ""Defendants"") usedmultiple holding companies and over a dozen bank accounts to perpetrate their fraud, theirunderlying scheme was simple. Between 2014 and June of 2017, Defendants sold at least $21.9million of promissory notes (the ""Notes"") to at least 44 investors in at least eight states.Defendants promised investors that their money would be used as bridge financing to fundconstruction and development of aninternational airport in Placentia, Belize (the ""PlacentiaAirport""). But, rather than use all of the funds asrepresented, Borland misappropriated morethan$5.98 million of investor assets and used the stolen principal to fund his family's lavishlifestyle.3. Borland funneled investor funds to himself and his family using the account ofanother entity under his control, Relief Defendant Canyon Acquisitions, LLC (""Canyon"") Š aholding company owned by Borland and his wife, Relief Defendant Alana LaTorra Borland(""Alana""}. From Canyon's account, Borland used investor funds to pay his family's expenses,including: (a) mortgage and property tax payments on the Borlands' multi-million dollar Floridamansion, (b) multiple luxury automobiles, (c) tuition for the Borlands' children at anelite privateschool, (d) $36,000 for the Borlands' membership at a posh beach club in Delray Beach, Florida,(e) nearly $ I0,000 for high-end watches, and (fl almost $2.7 million to pay off Alana's creditcards.4. While Borland and his family enjoyed the benefits of at least $5.98 million inpurloined investor cash, Note investors were not so lucky. The maturity dates on almost all, ifnot all, of the Notes have passed without repayment and all of the Notes have slipped intodefault. To this day, the overwhelming majority of Note investors have been paid none of whatthey are owed Š no interest payments and no return of principal.2Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 2 of 22 
 In the course of the fraud, Defendants repeatedly lied to Šand hid materialinformation from Šinvestors. In addition to lying about the use of investor funds, Defendantspromised outlandish returns with quick payment terms. But, while selling the Notes to newinvestors, Defendants hid the fact that the overwhelming majority of prior Notes were in defaultand prior Note investors had not been paid a dime of interest or principal.6. To make matters worse, Defendants perpetuated their fraudulent scheme bysecretly re-pledging the same collateral to multiple investors. Defendants led investors to believethat their Notes were secured by valuable real estate that was (a) worth at least twice as much asthe amount of the Note, (b) secured only that individual Note, and (c) would not be encumberedby any other liens or security interests. In reality, Borland pledged the same pazcels of real estateto multiple investors and reported fake valuations for the properties to investors to make itappear that the parcels were worth twice the face value of the Note.7. By making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors, and byengaging in a fraudulent offering scheme, Borland, BCG and Belize Fund have committedsecurities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. §78j(b}] and Rule lOb-5 thereunder (17 C.F.R. 240.1Ob-5] andSection 17(a} of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)].8. Borland's family Šincluding Alana and his mother in-law Šbenefited fromDefendants' fraud. And, the money that Borland took from investors to fund his family'slifestyle was only a fraction of the more than $14.4 million of investor funds that Borlandfunneled through Canyon. Canyon and Alana have no legitimate claim to the investor funds thatthey received as a result of Defendants' fraud and, therefore, were unjustly enriched by receivingthose funds. Canyon and Alana are, therefore, proper Relief Defendants in this action.3Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 3 of 22 
 9. The SEC brings this lawsuit to stop Defendants' violations of the federalsecurities laws, to prevent further harm to investors, and to seek disgorgement and civil penaltiesstemming from Defendants' wrongdoing, among other remedies.JURISDICTION AND VENUE10. The SEC brings this action under Securities Act Section 20(b) [IS U.S.C.§77t(b)], and Exchange Act Sections 21(d) and (e) [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d) and 78u(e)].11. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of theSecurities Act [15 U.S.C. § ?7v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa].12. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15U.S.C. § 78aa]. Many of the acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violationsalleged herein have occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for theSouthern District of New York.13. Defendant Borland ran BCG out of its offices at 79 Madison Avenue inManhattan and has conducted business relating to the Notes from that location, along withanother office in this District, including having phone calls and meetings with existing andprospective Note investors.14. Defendants directly and indirectly made use of the means and instrumentalities ofinterstate commerce and of the mails in connection with the acts, practices, and courses ofbusiness alleged herein, and will continue to do so unless enjoined.DEFENDANTS15. Brent Borland, age 48, is a resident of Sag Hazbor, New York, with a secondhome in Delray Beach, Florida. Borland is the sole owner of BCG Šwhich he operates out of itsManhattan office Šand Belize Fund. Borland co-owns Canyon with his wife, Alana. In 2011, the4Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 4 of 22 
      Ontario (Canada) Securities Commission initiated anaction against Borland, Canyon, and others.That action involved anunregistered securities offering where Borland and his codefendants soldinvestments in various real estate development projects, primarily projects in Belize. To resolvethat action, Borland and his codefendants were required to repay investors, and cease offering theinvestments at issue. Borland was further barred from being anofficer or director of any issuer,registrant, or investment fund subject to the jurisdiction of the Ontario Securities Commission.16. Belize Infrastructure Fund Y, LLC is a Florida Limited Liability Company thatpurports to be in the business of selling promissory notes to finance the construction of anairportin Placencia, Belize. The Belize Fund is owned and operated by Borland.17. Borland Capital Group, LLC, is a Delaware Limited Liability Companyheadquartered in New York City. It has offices located at 79 Madison Avenue in Manhattan.According to its website, BCG claims to be ""a multi-strategy investment holding company.""Among other things, BCG purports to be active in ""alternative investments such as.. .
infrastructure investment, development, and monetization."" BCG is owned and operated byBorland.RELIEF DEFENDANTS18. Canyon Acquisitions, LLC, is a Nevada Limited Liability Company. Canyon isowned by Borland and Alana. Borland's mother in-law serves as Canyon's office nnanager andissues checks and money orders from Canyon's account at the Borlands' direction. As describedbelow, in the course of Defendants' fraud, Canyon took at least $14.4 million of investor fundsinto its domestic checking account Šmoney to which Canyon had no legitimate claim. Borlandand Alana then used the Canyon account to pay for their own personal expenses.Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 5 of 22 
  19. Alana LaTorra Borland, age 41, is a resident of Sag Harbor, New York, with asecond home in Delray Beach, Florida. Alana is Brent Borland's wife and co-owns Canyon withBorland. As alleged below, in the course of Defendants' fraud, Alana received the benefit ofinvestor funds to which she had no legitimate claim, including (a) mortgage and property taxpayments on her home, (b) tuition payments for her children, (c) a family beach clubmembership, and (d) almost $2.7 million used to pay off her credit cards.FACTSBorland and His Entities:20. Borland is the sole owner of BCG, a Manhattan-based firm that, according to itswebsite, claims to be ""a multi-strategy investment holding company"" that is ""activein...alternative investments such as....infrastructure investment.""21. Among other projects, BCG claims to have invested millions of dollars in a largeresort complex near Placencia, Belize and claims to have invested $24 million along with itsBelizean partners towazds constructing and developing a private airstrip near the purported resortproject into aninternational airport. Borland claims that the airstrip Šwhich he calls thePlacentia International Airport Šwould, in addition to helping Borland and his partners sell realestate in a nearby planned development, be ""a significant standalone revenue generator"" and that,once operational, it would immediately receive 35 flights per day.22. Borland solicited investments in his purported Placentia Airport project throughBCG and Belize Fund.23. Borland controlled both BCG and Belize Fund, exercising control over everyaspect of their operations, including transactions to and from their bank accounts. Borland signedDCase 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 6 of 22 
  all of the Notes issued by BCG and Belize Fund and all of the pledges of collateral issued tosecure those Notes.Borland Sells Over $21.9 Million of Promissory Notes To Investors:24. From at least 2014 through June 2017, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund offeredand sold promissory notes to investors in the United States. In that time, BCG and Belize Fundsold at least 66 Notes to at least 44 investors in at least 8 states, generating proceeds of at least$21.9 million. Most of the Notes were issued by Belize Fund, while some were issued in thename of BCG.25. In marketing ttie Notes to investors, Borland Š and a BCG employee acting at hisdirection Štold investors that the proceeds of the Notes would be used for the construction anddevelopment of the Placencia Airport. Borland told investors that he and a partner in Belize hadinvested $24 million in the airport and that he needed ""bridge lenders"" to provide additional,short-term funding for airport construction while he worked to secure more substantial, long-term financing from institutional investors to complete the project.26. Borland, BCG,~ and Belize Fund promised investors unusually generous returnsand quick repayment. At a time when the federal funds rate was below 1 %per year, the Notesgenerally provided fora 15%return after 3 months and 1%per month for each month after thefirst three months, effectively offering interest of 24%per year.27. The Notes also promised a quick pay-off. Most of the Notes had a 12 or 24-monthterm. Some of the Notes provided aneven shorter term with a maturity date 3 months after thedate of the Note.28. Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund told the Note investors that the Notes were""bridge financing"" and would be repaid quickly. In fact, the Notes specified that while payment7Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 7 of 22 
   would be due by the maturity date, the borrower Š i. e., BCG or Belize Fund Šwould be requiredto ""pre-pay (retire)"" the Note within seven days if a target amount of investment was obtainedfor the ""Placentia International Airport Project."" In other words, payment on the Note was dueby the maturity date or when Defendants obtained long-term financing for the Placentia AirportŠwhichever came first.29. Borland told investors that he expected to close such long-term financing for thePlacentia Airport in short order because the airport was anattractive investment. Indeed,Borland told at least one investor that he ""guaranteed"" that his investment would only be for ashort term.30. Although the maturity of the Notes could be accelerated if BCG or Belize Fundobtained long-term financing for the Placentia Airport, BCG's and Belize Fund's paymentobligations on the Notes were not contingent on such financing. Each Note specified that ""[i]fthe Borrower does not satisfy all amounts due on [the Note] on the Maturity Date, the Borrowerwill be in default"" and that a penalty rate of interest would accrue until the Note was paid. Inother words, regardless of whether Defendants obtained long-term financing for the PlacentiaAirport, the Notes were in default once the maturity date passed without payment of principaland interest.31. The Notes are ""securities"" as that term is defined in Exchange Act Section3(a)(10) [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)] and Securities Act Section 2(a)(1) [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)].32. The Notes suggest the intended use of investors' principal. They specify that the""Bridge Note"" would come due once sufficient financing was obtained for the ""PlacentiaInternational Airport Project.""Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 8 of 22 
  33. Instead of a prospectus or offering memorandum, Borland used intermediatebrokers to introduce the investment opportunity to investors. Borland and/or his BCG employeethen offered a more detailed explanation of the investment to interested investors by telephone,e-mail, and web presentation. Borland and his BCG employee told investors during those calls,presentations, and in emails that their money would be used for construction of the PlacenciaAirport.34. Neither Borland nor his BCG employee told investors that any portion of theirNote proceeds would be paid to Borland or his family. Nor did they mention any other uses ofNote proceeds aside from the Placencia Airport.Borland's Misappropriation Of Investor Funds:35. While Borland and his entities were raising $21.9 million from Note investors,Borland took at least $5.98 million of that money to fund his lavish lifestyle.36. Borland misappropriated the vast majority of that $5.98 million of investor cashby funneling it through Canyon, anentity that he owns with his wife, Alana, and whichemployed Alana's mother. From there, Borland and Alana directed Alana's mother to issuechecks and wire transfers to pay the Borlands' personal expenses.37. From April 1, 2014 through September 29, 2017, Borland sent more than $14.4million of Note proceeds to Canyon's domestic checking account. Although Canyon had somefunds from other sources, that $14.4 million of investor cash represented more than 89% of themoney taken into Canyon's account. None of the funds in the Canyon account was transferred toaccounts in Belize or was otherwise used for construction projects in Belize.Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 9 of 22 
   38. Instead, Borland and his wife used the Canyon account Š and a BCG account thatalso was funded with Note proceeds Š astheir personal piggy-banks. From those accounts, theBorlands took at least $5.98 million to pay personal expenses.39. For example, between April 1, 2014 and September 29, 2017, the Borlands madethe following personal expenditures from the Canyon account that was funded withmisappropriated investor principal:(a) at least $925,785 in mortgage payments on properties owned by Borland andAlana, including their b,000 square foot, multi-million dollar Florida mansion;(b) more than $61,940 in property taxes on Borland and Alana's Florida home in2016 and 2017;(c) more than $97,000 to pay private school tuition for the Borlands' children;(d) more than $36,000 for the Borlands' membership and fees at a private beachclub and day spa in Delray Beach, Florida;(e) more than $31,000 to a high-end department store;(~ more than $11,000 in dues to Alana's mother's homeowners association;(g) a nearly $10,000 payment to anonline luxury watch website; and(h) more than $183,000.00 in cash withdrawals.40. Between Apri14, 2014 and September 29, 2017, Borland and Alana also took atleast $2.6? million from Canyon's account to pay off four credit cazd accounts in Alana's name.The credit card accounts were used primarily for personal expenses of the Borlands and none ofthe credit card charges related to airport construction in Belize.41. In addition, Borland and his wife used investor funds to buy luxury automobiles.For example:10Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 10 of 22 
  (a) On March 2, 2015, Borland took $25,000 from the Canyon account to make apayment on a Mercedes G63 luxury Sport Utility Vehicle (""SW"") which hasasticker price over $140,000;(b) In June 2015, Borland took $66,659.38 from a BCG account Šwhich includedco-mingled investor funds Šwhich he sent to a Cadillac dealership in EastTotowa, New Jersey; and(c) On April 27, 2017, Borland directed a second payment of $61,937.50 from thesame BCG account to the same Cadillac dealership towazd the purchase of aCadillac Escalade luxury SW.42. In total, Borland misappropriated over $5.98 million from accounts holding co-mingled investor funds to pay for his family's lavish lifestyle, including payments that benefittedAlana.43. While he solicited funds from investors and then misappropriated investor fundsfor his family's expenses, Borland Šacting through BCG, and Belize Fund Šacted with scienter.Borland knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthat the overwhelming majority of assets in theCanyon account came from Note proceeds and that money from that account was being used topay his family's personal expenses.Borland, BCG. and Belize Fund Lied To Investors About the Use of Investor Funds:44. From 2014 through at least June 2017, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund toldinvestors (and prospective investors) that their principal would be used to fund construction anddevelopment of the Placencia Airport. Similarly, term sheets Defendants provided to investorsrepresent that investors' proceeds will be used for ""operating capital."" No other use of investorprincipal was disclosed to investors.Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 11 of 22 
    45. Those representations were false when made. While a portion of the investedfunds may have been used to fund construction projects, Borland used at least 40% of investorfunds for other purposes. Most significantly, asdiscussed at paragraphs 35-43 above, Borlandused at least $5.98 million of investor principal to pay his family's personal expenses.46. In addition to using investor funds to pay personal expenses, Borland, BCG, andthe Belize Fund diverted Note proceeds to fund real estate projects that had no relation to Belizeconstruction projects and that were never discussed with investors. Specifically, Belize Fund sent$778,000 to a BCG account dedicated to a New York condominium investment at the New YorkRitz Carlton Residences in White Plains, New York and another luxury condominium building inNew Rochelle, New York. Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund did not tell Note investors that aportion of their principal would be used to fund investments in New York condominiums.47. Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund also diverted $1,431,568 of investor funds to paythird party brokers who introduced investors to BCG and Belize Fund.48. In sum, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund took at least $8,940,666 of investor fundsand used that money in ways that were not related to the disclosed purpose of the Notes Š i. e., tofund construction at the Placencia Airport and related projects in Belize. Those misused fundsrepresent at least 40% of the all funds raised from Note investors.49. Defendants' misrepresentations to Note investors regarding use of funds werematerial. In making aninvestment decision, a reasonable investor would deem it important that Šinstead of using investor funds aspromised (i. e., to fund the construction of Placentia Airport) Šapproximately 40% of investor funds was diverted for other purposes, including unrelated realestate projects, investor commissions, and over $5.98 million for the Borlands' personalexpenses.12Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 12 of 22 
  50. In making the misrepresentations and omissions identified above, Borland, BCG,and Belize Fund acted with scienter. At the time they told prospective investors about the natureof their investment, Borland, BCG, and the Belize Fund knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthatthe representations were not true and that they had diverted a significant portion of investorfunds for Borland's personal use and for other purposes unrelated to construction projects inBelize.Defendants' Fraudulent Pledging of the Sarae Collateral to Multiple Investors:51. All Note investors received pledges of collateral as ""security"" for their notes. Ascollateral, Borland pledged pazcels of real estate in Belize purportedly owned by Mayan LagoonEstates, LTD {""Mayan Estates""). All of the pledges of Mayan Estates pazcels were signed byBorland and one of his purported Belizean partners.52. The collateral pledge documents prohibited the pledged parcels of land frombeing transferred or encumbered in any way during the term of the pledge. With minor languagedeviations, the pledge documents each state that BCG and the Belize Fund ""shall not transferorencumber in any way this pledged property. Pledgor shall not permit any mortgages or liens toattach to the pledged property until the loan is repaid in its entirety.""53. Despite the fact that the pledge documents prohibited the pledged property frombeing transferred or encumbered in any way during the term of the pledge, Borland, BCG andBelize Fund pledged the same pazcels of property to multiple investors.54. Most investors were affected by this practice, asapproximately 77% of the Noteswere secured by collateral that Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund surreptitiously pledged to otherinvestors.13Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 13 of 22 
  5~. For example, between .l~ebruary and June of 201 ~, Borland pledged the sameparcel of land Šdescribed as `'Placencia Narth Block 36 Parcel 2169 .Known as Lot 84 of thesubdivision"" Š as collateral to secure Notes of at least 12 different investors. Borland did notinform any of the 12 investors that their collateral secured other Notes.~6. As another example, the below chart reflects three instances where the sameparcel of land Šdescribed as ""Lot 31"" Šwas pledged to secure three dii'ferent Notes withinweeks of one another in June of 2016:The Surreptitious Re-Pledging ~f Lot 31 t~ Three Investors`Date ofNote.:.9iS++iTerni""""of~Tute-«end`.~12Investor4mount of ~NotePledged :l,ot.t..Durationof Pied~e'.3.'

Borland signed each of the Collateral Pledge t-lgreements securing the three Notesidentified iii the above table. Each Collateral fledge Agreement stated that: ""Prior to obtaining[the investor's] written consent, [Mayan Estates] shall not transfer or encumber in any way thispledged property. [Mayan Estates] shall not perniit any mortgages or liens to attach to thepledged property unfit the loan is repaid in its entirety."" Despite that fact, after using Lot 31 tosecure the mote for Investor ~, I3orl~ind encumbered Lot 31 ~~~ith two additional security interests~y re-pledging it as collateral to secure the Notes for Investor B and Investor C.~s. In the case of the three investors identif ed in the above table, Borland not onlyimproperly pledged the same collateral simultaneously to each ~f the three investors, hedisclosed a very different valuation for the collateral each time he pled4~ed it. Each time hepledged Lot 31 as collateral, Borland assigned ~ value to the lot designed to make it appear thatt}~e lit vas worth t~~ice tl~e amatint of the Note in~restmet~t.14Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 14 of 22 
  59. Specifically, in the 24-day period between the three Notes, Borland disclosedthree different valuations for Lot 31, ranging between $200,000 and $2,000,000. If Lot 31 evenexists, at least two Šand possibly all three Š of the valuations that Borland provided for Lot 31were fake.60. Borland's secret re-pledging of the same collateral to multiple investors ŠandBorland's disclosure of wildly different valuations for the same collateral for each Note itsecured Šwas material. Borland, BCG, and the Belize Fund told investors that the collateralpledges would be exclusive. In making aninvestment decision, a reasonable investor would havefound it important that their collateral was securing the Notes of other investors. Suchduplicative pledging necessarily reduces the value of the collateral to any one investor andreduces the chance that the collateral Š if it exists at all Šcould be used to secure the investmentin the event of default. A reasonable investor also would find it important that the identifiedcollateral was assigned radically different valuations when securing other Notes.61. In pledging the same collateral to multiple investors Šand assigning substantiallydifferent values to the same pazcels when pledging the parcel to secure multiple Notes ŠBorland,BCG, and Belize Fund acted with scienter. Borland signed each of the Notes on behalf of BCGand Belize Fund and signed each of the collateral pledge documents related to those Notes.When he signed, Borland knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthat (1) the same parcels of realestate were being pledged to secure multiple Notes, (2) the collateral pledge documents expresslyprohibited the Defendants from encumbering the collateral once pledged (effectively barring theDefendants from pledging the same parcel to multiple investors), and (3) the collateral pledgedocuments assigned very different valuations to the same parcel when securing multiple Notes(reflecting that at least some of the valuations were fake).15Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 15 of 22 
   Defendants Fail to Tell New Note Purchasers That Older Notes Were In Default:62. With few exceptions, investors in the Notes have never received any interestpayments or a return of any portion of their principal. Over the course of the scheme, virtuallyall, if not all, of the Notes have entered default as the maturity dates passed without repayment.63. In marketing the Notes to Investors, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund touted theinvestment potential of the Placencia Airport and assured investors that they would be repaid ontime (if not before).64. But, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund failed to disclose to new Note investors thatthe overwhelming majority of prior Note investors had not been paid and that the prior Noteswere in default.65. For example, on Apri18, 2015, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund sold a $150,000Note to Investor D. That note provided for repayment in three months. But at that time, BelizeFund already was in default on nearly $3 million of Notes it had sold to prior investors. Like theNote sold to Investor D, the earlier notes provided for repayment in three months. Before hemade his investment on the expectation that he would be repaid in three months, Investor D wasnot told that Belize Fund already had defaulted on nearly identical Notes with the same 3-monthterm.66. Investor D's Note has long passed its July 8, 2015 maturity date. But Š to this dayŠInvestor D has not been paid any interest or principal.67. Similarly, on March 30, 2016, a year after Investor D purchased his note Šandover eight months after Investor D's Note entered default Š Investor E bought a $500,000 noteissued by Belize Fund. Though Investor E's Note had a 12-month term, Borland assured InvestorEthat long-term financing for the Placencia Airpart was imminent and the Note would be repaid16Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 16 of 22 
 within a few months. Investor E was never told that Š at the time he made his investment ŠBelize Fund already had defaulted on Notes sold to Investor D and other investors.68. As with the other Notes, Investor E's Note is now in default and Investor E hasnot received any interest or principal payments.69. Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions related to prior Note defaults werematerial. In evaluating whether to invest in the Notes, a reasonable investor would consider itimportant that substantively identical Notes issued to prior investors were in default and thatprior investors had received no interest or principal payments on their investment.70. In hiding prior Note defaults from Note investors, Borland, BCG, and BelizeFund acted with scienter. Borland signed each Note issued to investors, communicated withprospective investors about the Notes, and controlled every aspect of BCG's and Belize Fund'sinteractions with investors. In communicating with new investors, Borland, BCG, and BelizeFund knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthat Notes issued to prior investors were in default andthat nearly all prior investors had received little if any payment on their investment.Borland Invokes the Fifth Amendment in Resaonse to Questions Posed by the SEC:71. As part of its investigation into the securities law violations identified in thisComplaint, the SEC issued subpoenas to Borland, his second-in-command at BCG, his wifeAlana, and his mother in-law, requiring each of them to appear and provide testimony under oathto the SEC regarding matters including the use of funds Borland raised from investors.72. Borland, his second-in-command, Alana, and Alana's mother each refused toprovide substantive answers to the SEC's questions and instead invoked their right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.17Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 17 of 22

102,102,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the unsealing of fraud charges against a defendant who stole at least $400,000 from investors through the sale of non-existent pre-IPO shares of stock. The SEC also obtained emergency relief, including an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to halt the offering.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Keenan Gracey sold investors purported pre-IPO shares in Perspecta, Inc., a new company that will be formed as a result of the merger of three other companies. Although the merger is planned, Gracey's claims of ownership of pre-IPO shares in Perspecta were false. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Gracey has no interest in the not-yet-formed company and no IPO is planned for its stock. The SEC alleges that Gracey used publicly available information about the merger and false claims about his supposed connections with the companies involved to convince investors that they would recover sixty times their investment if they purchased pre-IPO shares from him.

The SEC's complaint filed under seal in federal court in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May 9, 2018 and unsealed today, charges Gracey with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against Gracey from further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as other emergency relief. The SEC complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, return of any ill-gotten gains with interest, and civil penalties.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Alec Johnson and was supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC's litigation will be led by Don Searles and supervised by Amy Longo.

The SEC encourages investors to be wary of any offer of pre-IPO shares, as further detailed in this investor alert.","  COMPLAINT

   SUMMARY
 3. The SEC brings this emergency action to halt an ongoing investment 
fraud
 by defendant 
Keenan Gracey
.  Gracey takes investors™ money promising to 
invest in ﬁpre
-IPOﬂ shares with a 6,000% return. 
 In reality, these shares do not even 
exist
Šthere is 
no 
planned IPO.  Inste
ad, Gracey just steals the money.  So far, he has 
taken at least $400,000 from 
known 
investors
, has received over $2 million 
through 
approximately 
107 wire transfers 
into his various bank accounts 
since 2016, and 
continues
 to 
solicit new investors. 
    4. On October 
11, 
2017, 
DXC Technology Company (ﬁDXCﬂ)
, announced 
a planned merger of its pu
blic sector business division with two private companies, 
KeyPoint Government Solutions 
(ﬁKeyPointﬂ) 
and Vencore, Inc.
 (ﬁVencoreﬂ), which 
ar
e both
 owned by private equity funds managed by Veritas Capital Fund 
Management, LLC (ﬁVeritasﬂ).  
The merger was initially expected to close in March 
2018, and i
s presently expected to close in 
May 2018. 5. Claiming that he comes from a wealthy family backgr
ound, 
Gracey 
falsely 
offers 
unsuspecting
 investors 
ﬁpre
-IPO shares
ﬂ of the planned new company
, even having them sign a ﬁshare 
purchase 
agreement
.ﬂ  However, neither the IPO nor 
the shares are real.  
DXC is not planning a public offering, and until the merger is 
finalized, no shares in the new company will be 
distributed
.  Moreover, 
Gracey 
neither own
s, nor has access to
, any shares
, nor has he 
any relationship with DXC, 
Ver
itas or its investment funds
, nor 
with Vencore or
 KeyPoint.

 FACTUAL 
ALLEGATIONS
 A. Background: Gracey™s Elaborate Façade of Wealth and Success 
 12. As part of 
an elaborate scheme to cause investors to part with their 
money, Gracey represents to investo
rs, orally and in solicitation emails,
 that he c
omes 
from a
n extremely
 wealthy family
, one
 wit
h ﬁan enormous array of military and 
  COMPLAINT
 4   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  governments contracts at our disposal to bol
st
er the companies we buy.ﬂ
 13. According to numerous investors, Gracey promotes himself by 
showcasing an extravagant life
style, clai
ming to own luxury homes in Beverly Hills 
and Seattle
 and 
a fleet of luxury automobiles
, including Bentleys and Ferraris
.  14. As part of his 
appearance 
of wealth, Gracey provided one or more 
investors with a
 heavily redacted 
bank statement, purporting to show
 that Gracey had 
immediate access to over $700 million.
 15. Gracey uses the 
illusion
 of wealth and privilege to convince investors 
that he has special access to exclusive financial transactions, claiming ﬁmulti 
generational success [that his family has] garner
ed through successful IPO™s and 
bringing private companies public.ﬂ  
 16. In fact, 
Gracey™s 
lavish lifestyle is an elaborate façade
 designed to 
falsely portray 
himself 
as an international man of
 finance
 with f
amily
 ties to various 
governments and government co
ntractors, to convince investors that he has 
unique 
access to lucrative financial deals
.   17. Gracey does not own either of the real properties 
that 
he claims to own
.     18. Gracey 
rents the luxury automobiles that he claims to own.
 19. Gracey has no connection with
 any of the companies 
in the merger that 
he claims to be involved with.
 20. Given the fact that Gracey is behind in rent on 
the properties he claims 
to own, 
and that his luxury automobiles have been repossessed, on information and 
belief, 
Gracey does not have 
immediate access to $700 million.
 21. Gracey™s false portrayal of the impression that his background and 
lifestyle provided him access to financial opportunities were material to investors™ 
decision
s to entrust their money to him.
 B. The Pre
-IPO Investment Scheme
 22. On October 11, 2017, DXC publicly announced that it would spin
 off its 
public sector business division and merg
e it with Vencore and KeyPoint to form a 
  COMPLAINT
 5   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  new publicly traded company.
 23. As noted in public announcements about the merger, 
private equity
 funds ma
naged by Veritas
, which
 own a
nd control 
both Vencore and KeyPoint
,will 
receive approximately 14% of the shares in the new company.  The remaining shares 
in the new company, which will be called Perspecta, Inc. (ﬁPerspectaﬂ), will be 
distributed to DXC™s sh
areholders. 
 24. No public offering of Perspecta shares 
has been
 announced, and contrary 
to Gracey™s representations to investors, no public offering is planned.  
 25. The merger
, originally expected to be finalized by March 31, 2018, is 
now expected to 
close in
 May 2018. 
 26. Beginning 
no later than October 
15, 
2017
, and continuing through the 
present, 
Gracey has used public information about the deal to lure investors into 
believing he own
s or has access to pre
-IPO shares in Perspecta.  
 27. Gracey communicates with in
vestors through in
-person mee
tings, by 
phone, by email, and by texts. 
 28. For example, 
Gracey showed 
several 
investors a 
DXC-created
 presentation (which is publicly available on DXC™s website) that highlighted the 
benefits of the merger and detailed the parti
es involved.  
 29. Gracey claimed 
to several investors orally 
and in emails 
that his 
grandfather had a controlling interest in several investment firms, including Veritas.  
 30. Based on his family™s alleged connection with Veritas, Gracey 
represented to investors
 orally and in emails 
that he made a personal investment of 
$150 million in the pre
-IPO stock, and further claimed to have 
purchased 
another 
$100 mill
ion
 of stock on margin to 
sell to other investors ﬁ
so as to earn 
[Gracey™s]
 $24 per share on the secondari
es 
[sic] 
insurance market.
ﬂ 
 31. Gracey offered to sell portions of this additional $100 million stake in 
pre
-IPO stock to investors.  
 32. Several investors received a ﬁShare Purchase Agreementﬂ 
in 
which

 6   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  Gracey represents 
that he ﬁis the owner of record of an agg
regate of Series A shares 
in a private company with NDA Chartered name NewCorp, which is the product of 
the merger of parts of DXC, Vencore, Keypoint, and any other businesses involved 
(the ﬁCorporationﬂ) that intends to go public with an IPO, in 2018, thr
ough an 
accredited investment consortium.ﬂ  
 33. In the ﬁShare Purchase Agreement
,ﬂ Gracey further represents
 that he is 
ﬁthe owner in clear title of the Shares and the Shares are free of any lien, 
encumbrance, security interests, charges, mortgages, pledges, 
or adverse claim or 
other restriction that would prevent the transfer of clear title to the Purchaser.ﬂ 
 34. Gracey agreed to sell these 
purported 
pre
-IPO shares 
to investors 
for $1 
a share
, in the Share Purchase Agreement
.  35. Gracey told investors
 orally and in
 emails
 that they would recover 
fifty 
to sixty 
times their investment after the newly
 formed company went public.  
 36. Gracey also offered 
a range of 
incentives for investors to bring in other 
investors,
 including
 offering to pay 10% of 
the profits he made on
 the ﬁsecondaries 
[sic] 
marketﬂ from these
 refer
rals
. 37. When he is taking investors™ money, Gracey knows, or is reckless or 
negligent in not knowing, that he does not have any access to or ownership in the 
shares he promises to provide the investors in excha
nge, and that he does not have the 
wealth and connections he claims to have in luring these investors.  
 38. Reasonable investors would have found it important to know that the 
securities at issue did not exist and that Gracey would keep the money they gave him 
without every delivering the promised ﬁpre
-IPOﬂ shares.  Reasonable investors would 
also have wanted to
 know that Gracey™s façade of wealth and connections was a ruse. 
 C. Gracey™s Representations Are False
 39. Gracey knows, or is reckless or negligent in not knowing, 
that 
his 
representations about the proposed IPO and his alleged financial interest in the new 
company to be formed are false.  
   COMPLAINT
 7   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  40. DXC has no intention, publicly stated or otherwise, to make a public 
offering of shares in connection with the merger and formation o
f Perspecta.  
 41. Rather, shares in Perspecta will be distributed to DXC shareholders and 
the Veritas funds with no separate offering.  
 42. Gracey knows, or is reckless or negligent in not knowing, 
that 
no 
Series 
A shares of 
Perspecta
 are authorized by Perspecta
™s articles of incorporation or 
bylaws, no Series A shares have been issued, and no shares in Perspecta
 can be 
acquired or distributed before the merger is finalized, which 
has not yet occurred. 
 43. Accordingly, Gracey knows, or is reckless or negligent in no
t knowing, 
that 
his claims that he already owns shares in 
the new company are 
false.
 44. In addition, and Gra
cey knows, or is reckless or negligent in not 
knowing, 
that 
he holds no financial interest in KeyPoint, Vencore, or 
in 
the Veritas 
funds, which 
own and
 control 
th
ose companies.  
 45. The majority of Veritas™
s clients are institutional investors, such as 
pension funds, and there are only three individual clients, none of whom have a 
connection to Gracey or his family.
 46. Gracey™s misrepresentation
s to investors 
were material to their decision 
to sign 
share 
purchase 
agreement
s and to give money to Gracey to purchase the pre
-IPO shares that Gracey offered and purpo
rted to own
.  Reasonable investor
s would 
have 
found it important to know
 that the securities at issue 
did not exist and that the 
money paid for those securities would be misappropriated. 
 D. Recent Events and Gracey™s Lulling Activities
 47. Numerous 
investors 
grew
 suspicious of 
Gracey after
 he indicated
 the 
purported IPO was 
ﬁdelayed
,ﬂ and some investors learned
 that Gracey did not own 
the real estate 
or expensive cars that he led them to believe he ow
ned. 
 48. Several investors have demanded the return of their monies, but Gracey 
has given them an array of excuses, including falsely claiming that that the 
SEC
 has 
frozen his 
accounts 
pending completion of the merger. 
   COMPLAINT
 8   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  49. A group of Washington
-based investors flew to Los Angeles in March 
2018 and confronted Gracey a
t his (rented) Beverly Hills estate.  At that time
, Gracey 
agreed to refund $50,000 within a week
, and to provide further details about the pre
-IPO 
investment
. 50.  Gracey neither refunded investors™ monies nor provided further details 
about the investment.
 51.  Instead, Gracey vacated his 
rented 
Beverly Hill estate and went 
to the  
state of 
Washington
, still 
owing over $50,000 in unpaid rent.
 52. Nonetheless, Gracey continues to lull investors into believing their pre
-IOP investment is 
safe and 
on track.
 53.  As recently as 
April 30
, Gracey 
distributed additional publicly available 
information concerning the formation
 of Perspecta
 to investors
, breathless
ly stating in 
at least one 
text message
, ﬁTrust me tho..(sic) that document ri
ght there is exactly 
what the [expletive
] we all been waiting for. 
ﬂ  
 54. Gracey continues to solicit new investors in his pre
-IPO scheme, and 
unless temporarily and permanently enjoined, will continue to do so.  
 55. In carrying out his offering fraud,
 Gracey 
has used
, and continues to use
, various
 means 
and instruments of 
interstate commerce, including
, but not limited to, 
interstate telephonic com
munications, email communications 
over t
he Internet, and 
interstate 
wire transfers of
 investor 
monies.

 Securities and Exchange Commission
    "
105,105,"On May 10, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against The Falls Event Center, LLC (The Falls), a Utah limited liability company, and its CEO Steven L. Down of West Jordan, Utah (Down) for making material misrepresentations to investors concerning the profitability of certain of The Falls' event centers.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, The Falls builds and operates small event centers. Since 2011, The Falls and Down raised approximately $120 million from more than 300 investors from the offer and sale of, among other things, convertible secured promissory notes. According to the complaint, Down solicited investments in The Falls by making presentations to groups of professionals during continuing education seminars that he sponsored. In his presentations, Down represented that some or all of the event centers were and continued to be profitable. The complaint alleges that certain of these representations to investors were untrue.

According to the complaint, from the first half of 2016 forward, members of The Falls' executive team informed Down that the event centers were not profitable. In addition, they informed Down that his event center model was unsustainable because of the millions of dollars owed to investors and to the event center mortgage holders.

In addition, The Falls' own accounting records, which Down received regularly from the Falls' CFO, indicate that, from inception through September 2017, the event centers were never profitable.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, The Falls and Down have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Down has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost, Alison Okinaka and Cheryl Mori of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Amy Oliver and Daniel Wadley."," Daniel J. Wadley (10358)

    Case No.:

-cv-00382-PMW
  Magistrate 
Judge: 
Paul M. Warner
   Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint 
against defendants
 The Falls Event Center, LLC (ﬁThe Fallsﬂ) and Steven L. Down (ﬁDownﬂ)
 (collectively, ﬁDefendantsﬂ) alleges as 
follows:
 INTRODUCTION
 1. This matter arises out of 
misrepresentations
 in the offer 
or sale of securities
 by The Falls and Down
, its CEO and founder
.  Down has raised approximately
 $120 million from 
approximately 300 investors for The Falls since 2011.  
   2 2. The 
Falls builds and operates small event centers that can be rented for events 
such as parties and weddings.  Currently The Falls has eight open and operating event centers
 in 
five states.
 3. The Falls offers several investment options to prospective investors. 
 Most 
investors have invested in The Falls™ convertible secured promissory notes (the ﬁNotesﬂ).  
The 
investments offered by The Falls, including the 
Notes
, are securities.
 4. Down has solicited investments in The Falls by, among other things, making 
presentat
ions to groups of prospective investors during continuing education seminars that he 
sponsors for dentists.  
 5. In his presentations Down consistently represented that 
some or all of the
 event 
centers were
 and continued to be profitable.  
 Certain of 
Down™s 
representations concerning the 
individual event centers were untrue, however.
  The Falls™ own a
ccounting records indicate that, 
from inceptio
n through September 2017, 
the event centers
 have never been profitable on the
 basis
 of generally accepted accountin
g principles (ﬁGAAPﬂ)
. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
 6. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction by authority of Sections 20 and 22 of 
the Securities Act of 1933 (the ﬁSecurities A
ctﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v].
  Defendants, 
directly and indirectly, singly and in
 concert, have made use of the means and instrumentalities 
of interstate commerce and the mails in connection with the transactions, acts and courses of 
business alleged herein, certain of which have occurred within the District of Utah.
 7. Venue for this act
ion is proper in the District of Utah under Section 22(a) of the 
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]
, because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and 
  3 courses of business alleged in this Complaint took place in this district and because Defendants
 reside in and transact business in this district.
 8. Defendants, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to engage 
in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein and in transactions, 
acts, practices, and 
courses of business of similar purport and object.
 9. Defendants™ conduct took place in connection with the offer
 or sale of 
investments, including 
Notes
, issued by 
The Falls
, which are securities. 
 DEFENDANTS
 10. The Falls Event Center, LLC is a Utah limited 
liability company with its principal 
office in West Jordan, Utah.  It was formed by Down in 2011.
  The Falls opened its first event 
center in St. George, Utah in the fall of 2013.  Its most recent center was opened in McMinnville, 
Oregon in March 2017.
 11. Ste
ven L. Down, 60, is a resident of Draper, 
Utah
.  Down is the CEO of The 
Falls.  
From 2011 to the present, Down offered and sold investments to individuals either 
individually or through his entity The Falls.
     STATEMENT OF FACTS
 12. Down
 formed 
The Falls
 in 
2011 as a 
Utah
 LLC.   13. Down is the CEO of The Falls.  He directs The Falls™ operations and makes 
decisions regarding how The Falls raises and spends investor funds.
 14. The Falls opened its first event center in the fall of 2013 and currently has eight 
open and
 operating event center
 locations
.  The Falls typically purchases the land and constructs 
the event centers itself.  The Falls
 also owns approximately
 13 parcels of vacant land on which it 
plans to build new event centers.
   4 15. The currently open and operating 
locations are in Salt Lake City
 and
 St. George, 
Utah; Elk Grove, Fresno and Roseville, California; Littleton, Colorado; McMinnville, Oregon; 
and Gilbert, Arizona.
 16. The purchase and construction of the event centers is and has been financed 
through loans
 made by private investors
, bearing interest rates of 10 to 14% 
per
 year
.  The Falls 
referred to these loans as ﬁhard moneyﬂ loans.  
The Falls obtained hard money loans
 because 
it 
was not able to obtain traditional bank financing at lower interest rates. 
  17. The
 hard money
 loans are secured by mortgages on the event centers.  
As of 
September 30, 2017 the principal amount of these loans was $33.5 million.
 18. Down 
has 
locate
d prospective investors by presenting
 his sales pitch for The Falls
 at 
continuing education seminars 
that he sponsor
ed for dentists
.  During the seminar lunch break, 
Down
 gave his presentation regarding an investment in The Falls.
  Down™s presentation, and the 
accompanying PowerPoint, has remained essentially the same for yea
rs.
 19. In his presentation, Down always represented that many if not all of the event 
centers were profitable even before they opened, 
because they were accepting event bookings 
before they opened.  Down represented that
 that the
 event centers
 continued to be
 profitable after 
they opened
.  Down
 represented to
 investors that, after The Falls had
 12 centers, 
it would be able 
to obtain institutional loans to replace the hard money loans
.   20. In his presentation, Down 
always 
state
d that The Falls 
would
 have 
200 even
t centers by 2022
.  He 
always 
represent
ed that each event center 
would 
earn gross revenue of $1 
million 
per
 year and cover expenses of approximately $650,000, leaving profit of approximately 
$350,000, or 35%
, per
 year
.     5 21. In his presentation, Down
 always stated 
that therefore the 200 projected centers 
would
 bring in 
net
 income
 of $
70 million 
per 
year
, and th
at The Falls 
would
 achieve a 
price/earnings ration of 40, causing it to be worth 
$2.8 billion by the time it has 200 centers in 
2022.  
He alway
s forecasts that, a
fter 
2022, the company will 
either 
go public or be bought out
.  22. Prospective investors
 were
 often
 flown to Salt Lake City or to one of the 
other 
event centers, and 
given an opportunity to 
meet
 the executive team of The Falls
.  They 
were
 provided with 
the company™s 
private placement memorandum, its
 current Business Plan 
Summary and its 
most recent quarterly investor newsletter.
 23. Investors usually invest
ed in The Falls™ 
Notes.  
As of September 30, 2017 
The 
Falls had
 approximately $78 million 
in 
Notes 
outstanding.  As of that date, accrued interest 
expense related to these 
Notes on the company™s profit and loss statement was nearly $2 million.
 24. After investing, investors 
did
 not receive any updated disclosures from The Falls 
other than a quarter
ly investor newsletter that often include
d a letter from Down on recent 
events.
 25. The Falls maintained its books using QuickBooks software, which  generates 
financial 
statements in accordance with GAAP.  
Beginning in approximately 2011, 
The Falls™ 
chief financial officer 
(ﬁCFOﬂ) 
provided Down with reports each month that included 
GAAP 
profit and loss statements for the individual event centers.
 26. In 2014, Down and other company executives decided to generate 
a new type of 
monthly profit and
 loss
 statement for the event centers
, using the figure for event bookings 
instead of the GAAP revenue figure.  
They called these statements ﬁmodified accrualﬂ profit and 
loss
 statements.  
   6 27. Accordingly, at the direction of Down and the other executives, th
e CFO
 began 
preparing 
monthly 
profit and loss statements using bookings instead of GAAP revenue.  
 28. The CFO e
-mailed these statements in internal reports to Down and other 
executives almost every month from 2014 until the CFO  left the company in March 2017
.   29. In his presentations to investors, Down did not disclose that The Falls was using 
ﬁmodified accrualﬂ profit and loss statements. 
 30. In the first half of 2016 
the CFO
 attended an investor presentation by Down.  
After hearing the presentation he told Down
 that Down had to stop telling prospective investors 
that the centers were making 
a profit, because they were 
not doing so. 
 MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS
 31. In a newsletter The Falls sent out between January and August 2014, Down
 stated: ﬁThe Falls at St. George is now profitable and gaining momentum.  A monthly return on 
revenue of 35% is looking possible sometime this year!ﬂ
  According to The Falls™ QuickBooks, 
however, St. George experienced a net operating loss in every month 
but one from January to 
August 2014.  Over this period St. George had a net operating loss of $81,531.  According to the 
ﬁmodified accrualﬂ P&Ls, from January to August 2014
, St. George had a net operating loss of 
$57,035, with only three out of eight mont
hs showing net profit.  
 32. In a letter to investors included in an October 2015 investor newsletter
, Down
 state
d, ﬁ[w]e currently have five event centers operating; each one operating profitably.ﬂ  These 
five would have been St. George, Elk Grove (two buildi
ngs) and Fresno (two buildings).
 Through September 2015, however, QuickBooks shows that St. George lost $104,757; Elk 
Grove lost $657,261; and Fresno lost $102,682.  On a ﬁmodified accrualﬂ basis, this statement is 
false
 as to St. George and Elk Grove
.    
   7 33. Between February 2016 
and December 2016
, Down told four investors
 that the 
centers were profitable.  
On a GAAP basis, for the 2016 year, however, the company™s 
QuickBooks 
reflects
 that all centers had net losses.  On a ﬁmodified accrual
ﬂ basis, for the 2016 
year, 
only two out of the eight center
s were profitable
.   34. In a presentation to a group of investors in January 2017 in Seattle, Down stated
: ﬁ. . . we went into Elk Grove and built these two buildings.  These two buildings were profit
able 
in month one.  We™re getting about 35 percent return this year.ﬂ
  On a GAAP basis, and even 
on a ﬁmodified accrual
ﬂ basis
, Down™s claim that Elk Grove was ﬁprofitable in month oneﬂ was 
incorrect.  Elk Grove opened in November 2014.  For its first mont
h, its net loss was $114,268.
  In its second month, its net loss was $84,186.  On a ﬁmodified accrualﬂ basis, Elk Grove lost 
$67,689 in its first month and lost $52,813 in its second.    
 35. In March 2017
, Down told 
an investor 
that ﬁthe Fresno buildings were
 profitable 
in the first month.ﬂ  
On a GAAP basis, this statement 
is incorrect
.  Fresno opened in August 
2015.  In its first month, its net loss was $52,434.  On
ly 
on the
 ﬁmodified accrualﬂ basis
 is this 
statement correct
.  On that basis Fresno had net inc
ome of $12,914 in its first month.      
 DOWN™S NEGLIGENCE
 36. Down
 was at least negligent in 
making representations to investors regarding the 
profitability
 of individual event centers.  Down was the CEO of The Falls and had 
ready 
access 
at all times to 
all 
its financial
 information.  
 In fact, profit and loss information was regularly 
provided to him by executives at The Falls.
 37. From the inception of The Falls until at least 2014, The Falls™ CFO provided 
Down with a QuickBooks profit and loss statement for th
e event centers, prepared on a GAAP 
basis.  
   8 38. Beginning in 2014
 and continuing until March 2017
, The Falls™ CFO provided 
Down with ﬁmodified accrualﬂ profit and loss statements for the event centers by e
-mail every 
month.  
 39. From the first half of 2016 forwa
rd, Down was informed on numerous occasions 
by members of his executive team at The Falls that the event centers were not profitable.  
They 
informed Down
 that the centers were not close to achieving $1 million in annual 
gross 
revenue 
or 35% profit per cent
er, as Down was representing to investors.
  They informed Down that his 
event center model was unsustainable because of the huge amount of mortgage debt on the event 
centers and because of the tens of millions of dollars of Note principal and accrued inter
est.
 40. Down was at least negligent in not reviewing, or assimilating, the profit and loss 
information provided to him by The Falls™ CFO, while continuing to make false representations 
to investors that the event centers were profitable. 
  41. In his presentation
s to investors, Down did not disclose that The Falls was using 
ﬁmodified accrualﬂ profit and loss statements.  Down was at least negligent in not making these 
disclosures to investors.
 42. Either the GAAP profit and loss statements or the ﬁmodified accrualﬂ pr
ofit and 
loss statements would have shown Down that he was mistaken in touting the profitability of the 
event centers
 in the course of raising money from investors
.   FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

   "
107,107,"A former microcap company president charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with defrauding over 700 investors nationwide who were pressured to invest has agreed to lifetime officer-and-director and penny stock bars.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from 2009 until 2015, Keith Houlihan of Boca Raton, Florida, while president of publicly-traded Sanomedics, Inc., hired and worked with an unregistered broker and his boiler room operation to illegally sell shares of Sanomedics by cold-calling the investing public using high-pressure sales tactics. In 2009 and 2010, Houlihan falsely told investors that for a limited time he was able to offer them Sanomedics shares at a steep discount to the stock's market price. The complaint alleges further that Houlihan used investor monies to pay undisclosed sales commissions to boiler room sales agents and more than $110,000 to himself for personal expenses. In 2013 and 2014, Houlihan signed Sanomedics' annual and quarterly filings with the SEC that contained false statements about Sanomedics' financing and did not disclose the illegal boiler room activity.

In December 2017, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida criminally charged Houlihan. He was subsequently sentenced to 111 months imprisonment and ordered to pay approximately $21 million in restitution.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida on May 4, 2018, charges Houlihan with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and with aiding and abetting the boiler room's violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Sanomedics' violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. In addition to the lifetime bars, Houlihan agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC charged the boiler room operator, Miguel ""Michael"" Mesa, and Sanomedics' former CEO, Craig V. Sizer, with fraud in 2016. A federal court subsequently entered consented-to final judgments against Mesa and Sizer that imposed lifetime penny stock bars on each of them and a lifetime officer-and-director bar on Sizer. The SEC subsequently barred Mesa and Sizer from the securities industry.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gary M. Miller of the Enforcement Division's Microcap Fraud Task Force in the Miami office with assistance from Eric Morales and Senior Trial Counsel Alejandro O. Soto. The case was supervised by Elisha L. Frank and Jason R. Berkowitz of the Microcap Fraud Task Force. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida.

The SEC strongly encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the agency's Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTI
VE AND OTHER RELIEF 
  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Co
mmission (ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges as follows: 
 INTRODUCTION  1. The Commission brings this action agai
nst Keith Houlihan (ﬁDefendantﬂ) for 
violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. 
2. From April 2009, through A
ugust 2015, while he was president of Sanomedics 
International Holdings, Inc. (ﬁSanomedicsﬂ), Defe
ndant participated in a fraudulent scheme that 
raised approximately $21 million from approximate
ly 700 investors, by: (1
) directly soliciting 
prospective investors to purchase Sanomedics sh
ares based on false statements; (2) hiring a 
boiler room to pitch Sanomedics™ stock to prospe
ctive investors using false statements regarding 
the price and limited number of Sanomedics shares
 being sold; (3) supporting the boiler room by 
paying sales agents undisclosed commissions; and (4
) signing Sanomedics™ pe
riodic filings with 
the Commission that contained materially fa
lse and misleading statements and omissions 
regarding Sanomedics™ use of an illegal 
boiler room to fina
nce its operations. 3. From May 2009 to May 2010, Defendant soli
cited, offered and sold shares of 
Sanomedics stock to prospective investors fa
lsely stressing that for a limited time only, a 
Case 9:18-cv-80585-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2018   Page 1 of 13  2ﬁlimited numberﬂ of Sanomedics shares were av
ailable to investors fo
r purchase at a steep 
discount to the current price of Sanomedics™ shares then quoted 
on the Over-the-C
ounter Bulletin Board (ﬁOTCBBﬂ), an electronic trading servi
ce that offers investors price and volume 
information for equity securities. 
4. Defendant used money received from Sanome
dics™ investors to hire a boiler room 
operator to solicit prospective invest
ors to purchase Sanomedics stock.  
5. Defendant used money received from
 Sanomedics™ investors for sales 
commissions, fees, and other monetary distribu
tions to support a boiler room operation whose 
sales agents offered and sold Sanomedics stock. 6. Defendant, as Sanomedics™ president, 
signed Sanomedics™ stock certificates 
representing ownership interests for investors who bought shares from the boiler room operation. 
7. Defendant signed Sanomedics™ false filings
 with the Commission that failed to 
disclose that Sanomedics was fraudulently 
raising money through a boiler room operation. 
8. Through his fraudulent conduct, th
e Defendant received over $100,000
 of investors™ proceeds for his own personal benefit and use.   
9. Through this misconduct, Houlihan: (a) viol
ated Section 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) and Section 10(
b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(ﬁExchange Actﬂ) and Rule 10b-5

Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Ru
les 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and (d) violated Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act.  Un
less enjoined, the Defendant is reasonably likely 
to engage in future violations of the federal securities laws.      
   Case 9:18-cv-80585-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2018   Page 2 of 13  3THE DEFENDANT 
10. Houlihan, age 50, was a resident of Boca Raton, Florida and the co-founder and 
president of Sanomedics.  Houlihan is not, an
d was not at the time of
 the conduct described 
herein, registered with the Commi
ssion as a broker or dealer.   BACKGROUND OF SANOMEDICS 
11. Sanomedics, f/k/a ﬁSanomedics Internat
ional Holdings, Inc.,ﬂ is a company 
incorporated in Delaware with its principal 
place of business in Miami, Florida.  It was 
purportedly in the business of 
developing and selling non-cont
act infrared thermometers.  
Sanomedics became a publicly-tra
ded company in July 2009 through a reverse merger with a 
public shell company.  It was an SEC-reporti
ng company and was quoted on OTC Link, which is 
operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the symbol ﬁSIMH,ﬂ from October 27, 2010 until 
May 2, 2017, when the Commission filed a settled administrative proceeding against Sanomedics 

pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act revoking its registration. 12. Sanomedics™ stock is a ﬁpenny stockﬂ as
 defined by the Exchange Act. At all 
times relevant to this action, the stock™s shares 
traded at less than one dollar per share. During 
the same time period, Sanomedics™ stock did not
 meet any of the exceptions to penny stock 
classification pursuant to Exchange Act Section 
3(a)(51), 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(51), and Rule 3a51-1, 17 C.F.R. § 240.3a51-1. For example Sanomedics
™ stock: (a) did not trade on a national 
securities exchange; (b) was not
 an ﬁNMS stock,ﬂ as defined in 17 C.F.R. § 242.600(b)(47); (c) 
did not have tangible assets (i.e
., total assets less intangible assets and liabilities) in excess of 
$5,000,000; and (d) did not have average revenue 
of approximately $6,000,000 for the last three 
years.   
 Case 9:18-cv-80585-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2018   Page 3 of 13  4JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 13. This Court has jurisdiction ove
r this action pursuant to 
Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 
22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b
), 77t(d) and 77v(a); and Sections 21(d), 21(e), 
and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 
U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa(a). 14. This Court has personal jurisdiction over th
e Defendant and venue is proper in the 
Southern District of Florida because many of th
e acts and transactions constituting the violations 
alleged in this complaint occurred in this Distri
ct.  Moreover, Defendant 
resided in the Southern 
District of Florida when the 
acts and transactions alleged in this complaint occurred and 
Sanomedics had its principal 
office in this District.   15. In connection with the conduc
t alleged in the complaint, Defendant, directly or 
indirectly, singly or in concert with others, ma
de use of the means or
 instrumentalities of 
interstate commerce or the mails. 
THE FRAUD SCHEME 
A. The Fraudulent Offer and Sale of Sanomedics Stock  16. In 2009, Houlihan, together with Sanomedi
cs™ co-founder, hired an unregistered 
broker and his boiler room operati
on (the ﬁBoiler Room 
Operatorﬂ) to solicit, offer, and sell 
shares of Sanomedics st
ock to the public.   17. Beginning in 2009 and continuing until approximately 2015, the Boiler Room 
Operator supervised the boiler room
 sales agents as they solicite
d prospective investors, through 
cold calling, to raise approximately $21 million fro
m the fraudulent sale of shares of Sanomedics 
stock to about 700 investors nationwide.     
18. From May 2009 to May 2010, Houlihan also
 personally solicited investors to 
purchase Sanomedics shares falsely telling them th
at, for a limited time, he was able to offer a 
Case 9:18-cv-80585-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2018   Page 4 of 13  5limited number of Sanomedics shares at a steep 
discount to the stock™s then current quoted price 
on the OTCBB.    
19. Houlihan and the co-founder us
ed money received from 
Sanomedics™ investors to 
pay undisclosed sales commissions, fees, and othe
r monetary distributions to the Boiler Room 
Operator, the sales agents, and to themselves
.  Houlihan knew that approximately 50% of 
investors™ proceeds were paid as commissions and 
fees to the sales agents and the Boiler Room 
Operator, and as monetary paym
ents to himself and others. 
20. Defendant, as Sanomedics™ president, 
signed Sanomedics™ stock certificates 
representing ownership interests for investors who bought shares from the boiler room operation. 
21. From 2013 until 2015, Houlihan received approximately $110,106 in proceeds 
from the fraudulent sale of Sanomedics st
ock for his own personal benefit and use. B. Material Misrepresentations and 
Omissions to Sanomedics Investors 1.  False Promise Offering Sanomedics Shares at a Steep Discount  22. Beginning in May 2009 until May 2010, Hou
lihan solicited prospective investors 
by telling them that, for a limited time, he 
was able to offer them a limited number of 
Sanomedics shares at a steep 
discount to the stock™s then 
current quoted pr
ice on the OTCBB. Houlihan knew his statement to investors wa
s false because he controlled the number of 
Sanomedics shares and authorized
 stock splits to ge
nerate those shares. 
And, contrary to his 
representation to investors that 
he was selling them Sanomedics 
shares at a steep discount, at 
least two investors purchased shares at $1.50 per share when 
the then prevailing quoted price 
was no greater than $0.20.   Case 9:18-cv-80585-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/04/2018   Page 5 of 13  62.  False Filings that Omitted the Boiler Room Operation 
23. In his capacity as Sanomedics™ president,
 Houlihan signed Sa
nomedics™ periodic 
filings with the Commission, in
cluding its fiscal 
years 2013 and 2014 annua
l reports (Forms 10-
K), and its quarterly filings (Forms 10-Q) during 
that same period.  Those filings contained false 
statements and statements that 
were rendered false or misleading 
by the failure to disclose that 
Sanomedics was obtaining substa
ntial financing through the fraudulent sale of stock by the boiler room. 
24. Sanomedics™ 2013 Form 10-K/
A falsely stated that the cash received from 
financing activities during the fiscal year came primarily from the issuance of convertible notes 
and from debt issued to an affiliate of the co-f
ounder.  In fact, the money was not a loan, but was 
instead raised from the issuance of stoc
k sold by the undisclosed boiler room.    
25. Sanomedics™ 2014 Form 10-K falsely portray
ed its financing as principally the 
issuance of debt.  In fact, Sanomedics™ principa
l source of financing was the funds it received 
from the boiler room. 
C.     Scheme Conduct 
 26. Houlihan engaged in a long 
running scheme to defraud 
investors using the Boiler-Room Operator™s operation.  H
oulihan hired the Boiler Room 
Operator and used the Boiler 
Room Operator™s unlicensed sales agents to mark
et and sell Sanomedics™ 
stock.  Houlihan used 
at least 50% of the investor proceeds to pay sale
s commissions and fees to the sales agentsŠand 
to himselfŠwithout disclosing those payments
 to investors. After investors purchased 
Sanomedics stock, Houlihan signed stock certif
icates representing an 
ownership interest in 
Sanomedics™ shares sold by the boiler room.

108,108,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a Thai citizen who worked with his brother to reap millions in illegal gains by trading in advance of the May 2013 announcement that China-based Shuanghui International Holdings (now WH Group) would acquire Smithfield Foods.

The SEC's complaint alleges that in early May 2013, Bovorn Rungruangnavarat coordinated with his brother, Badin Rungruangnavarat, to acquire large volumes of call options, futures, and shares of Smithfield after learning of the potential acquisition from a close, personal friend who worked as an investment banker. According to the complaint, the brothers' purchases were so aggressive that they acquired control over approximately 32.5% of the average daily trading volume of Smithfield stock during May 2013. After the planned acquisition was announced on May 29, 2013, they sold their position for profits of approximately $3.8 million.

The SEC previously charged Badin with insider trading in June 2013. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Badin settled those charges and agreed to disgorge $3.2 million in illegal trading profits and to pay a $2 million civil penalty. The complaint filed today charges Bovorn with insider trading for additional profits of approximately $560,000.

The SEC's complaint against Bovorn Rungruangnavarat charges him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of the remaining ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and penalties.

The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Frank D. Goldman and James A. Scoggins of the Market Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office and R. Kevin Barrett of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation is being handled by Mark L. Williams. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand.","   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

ission (the ﬁSECﬂ), alleges as follows:  SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 1. This action involves insider trading by Defendant Bovorn Rungruangnavarat (ﬁBovornﬂ) in the securities of U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, Inc. (formerly NYSE:SFD) 
(ﬁSmithfieldﬂ) before the May 2013 announcement th
at Smithfield would be acquired by China-
based Shuanghui Holding™s International (ﬁShuanghuiﬂ).   2. On Wednesday, May 29, 2013, before the markets opened, Shuanghui, now 
known as WH Group Limited, announced that it had 
agreed to acquire Smithfield for $4.7 billion 
(the ﬁAnnouncementﬂ), which at the time repres
ented the largest proposed takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese buyer.  Shuanghui agreed
 to pay $34 per share, or a 31% premium over 
Smithfield™s closing price of $25.97 per shar
e on May 28, 2013.  Following the Announcement, 
the price of Smithfield stock jumped sharpl
y opening at $32.39 per share and closing at $33.35 per share on May 29, 2013. Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 1 of 17 PageID #:1  2  3. Between May 6, 2013 and May 28, 2013, based on the inside information that 
Bovorn learned from a close, personal friend wh
o worked at an investment bank, Bovorn and his 
brother, Badin Rungruangnavarat (ﬁBadinﬂ), purchased or caused to be purchased 75,000 shares of Smithfield stock, 3,000 Smithfield call opti
ons, and 2,580 Smithfield futures contracts.  
Following the Announcement, Bovorn and Badin 
reaped illicit proceeds of approximately $3.8 
million.  
4. On June 5, 2013, the SEC sued Badin for insider trading in Smithfield securities.  
See SEC v. Rungruangnavarat, 13-cv-4172 (N.D.Il.) (the ﬁoriginal actionﬂ).  In the original action, the SEC identified a single brokerage acc
ount that accounted for many but not all of the 
illicit trades noted in paragraph 3 above.  The SEC alleged that Badin™s well-timed trades yielded 
gains of approximately $3.2 million.  After secu
ring an emergency asset freeze, the SEC reached 
a settlement with Badin that provided for disgor
gement of the then-known trading profits in the 
amount of $3.2 million and a $2 million civil penalty.   
5. The SEC now charges that Bovorn, in concert with his brother Badin, used material, nonpublic information to purchase or ca
use to be purchased the Smithfield securities 
noted in the original action as
 well as 74,900 Smithfield shares in four additional accounts, not 
known at the time of the origin
al action, that Bovorn and his brother controlled, reaping additional profits of approximately $560,000.  In to
tal, Bovorn and Badin generated illicit gains of approximately $3.8 million.

Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 4 of 17 PageID #:4  5  The Smithfield Acquisition 13. On Wednesday, May 29, 2013, Shuanghui publ
icly announced that it had agreed to acquire Smithfield for $4.7 billion or $34 per 
share.  Following the Announcement, the price 
of Smithfield™s stock, which had closed at $25.9
7 per share on May 28, jumped and closed at 
$33.35 per share on May 29, an increase of 28.4%.  The stock™s trading volume also increased 

sharply that day reaching a volume of 72.5 m
illion shares, approximately 3,610% above its 
average daily trading vol
ume for that month.   
14. In the weeks leading up to the Announcement, Shuanghui was not the only 
company courting Smithfield.  In late April 
and early May 2013, Smithfield had entertained 
other potential suitors, including a company headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand (hereinafter ﬁCompany Aﬂ).  In pursuing a potential acquisiti
on of Smithfield, Company A received financial 
advice from a Thailand-based investment bank 
(the ﬁThai Investment Bankﬂ), where Bovorn™s 
close, personal friend worked as an Asso
ciate Director (the 
ﬁInvestment Bankerﬂ). 
15. On April 24, 2013, Smithfield and its financial advisor met with the Thai 
Investment Bank and stated that Smithfield was 
willing to entertain an acquisition offer from 
Company A.  By no later than May 3, 2013, the Th
ai Investment Bank had developed a plan for Company A to acquire Smithfield, 
including the acquisition target date, timeline, and transaction 
details, and presented it to 
Company A.  On May 8, 2013, the Thai Investment Bank submitted a 
non-binding written proposal to Smithfield for Co
mpany A to acquire Smithfield at a price of 
$31-$35 per share.  By no later than May 15, 2013, Company A and the Thai Investment Bank 
were given access to an electronic data room 
to conduct due diligence regarding Smithfield.  
16. On May 22, 2013, the Thai Investment Ba
nk delivered to Smithfield a revised 
non-binding written proposal in which Compa
ny A offered to acquire Smithfield for $34.00 per 
share in cash.  On May 25, 2013, Smithfield aske
d Company A to significantly accelerate the 
Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 5 of 17 PageID #:5  6  timeframe for the proposed acquisition, but Company A declined.  As a result, Smithfield 
rejected Company A™s proposal and accepted S
huanghui™s offer, which was announced on May 
29, 2013. Bovorn and His Brother Obtained Material, Nonpublic Information 
17. At all times relevant to the facts here
in, Bovorn was close, personal friends and business associates with the Investment Banker.  Bovorn and the Investment Banker attended high school and college together, and from no 
later than 2005 through no earlier than 2008, the Investment Banker was employed as the fina
ncial controller of 
Bovorn™s company, Nizza 
Plastics.  In or about June 2011, Bovorn and the Investment Banker star
ted a business purporting to be a joint venture focused on becoming a leading beverage ope
rator in Thailand and Southeast Asia.  Bovorn, Badin, and the Investment Banker we
re also part of a group of individuals who shared information regarding potential securitie
s investments and engage
d in currency trading 
and other investments. 
18. Bovorn knew that the Investment Banker 
was employed by the Thai Investment 
Bank and that the Investment Banker had acce
ss to confidential information about potential 
business transactions.   19. By no later than April 29, 2013, during the course of his employment at the Thai 
Investment Bank, the Investment Banker obtaine
d material, nonpublic information concerning 
Company A™s potential acquisition 
of Smithfield.  The Investment Banker owed his employer 
and Company A duties to maintain the confidenti
ality of this information and was prohibited 
from sharing this information outside of the bank.   
20. Notwithstanding this duty, by no later than May 3, 2013, the Investment Banker 
conveyed material, nonpublic information about the potential Smithfiel
d acquisition to Bovorn. Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 6 of 17 PageID #:6  7  Bovorn and His Brother Illegally Traded Smithfield Securities

ation that the Investment Banker

22. Despite Bovorn™s active involvement in
 funding, strategizing about, and placing these trades, he avoided accumulating any Smithfiel
d securities in brokerage accounts he held in 
his own name. A. EFG Account  23. On May 6, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 7,500 Smithfield shares through an account at EFG Bank 
(ﬁEFGﬂ) in Singapore, which was jointly held in the names of Badin and the brothers™ fath
er.  Bovorn and Badin jointly paid $191,881.13, or 
$25.58 per share, to acquire the shares.  Bovorn and Badin both historically communicated with 
the financial advisor for the account to discuss, direct, and execute trades.   
B. GK GOH Account 
 24. On May 7, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 19,300 Smithfield shares in an account held in Badi
n™s name at GK GOH Financ
ial Services Pte. Ltd. (ﬁGK GOHﬂ) in Singapore.  Bovorn and Badin jointly paid $495,708.57, or $25.68 per share, to buy those shares.  On May 8, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased another 10,000 Smithfield shares, paying 
$259,917.64, or $25.99 per share.  Bovorn was an authorized trader on the account since at least August 30, 2007. C. DMG Account  25. On May 8, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased more Smithfield shares through an account held in Ba
din™s name at DMG & Partners Securities Pte 
Ltd. (ﬁDMGﬂ) in Singapore.  That day, Badin sent an email to an account 
representative at DMG Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 8 of 17 PageID #:8  9  bearing subject line ﬁBuy US Stock,ﬂ and stating, in relevant part: ﬁMy brother would like to buy US stocks as per following detail. The order to buy should be at price range not over 26.ﬂ   26. The DMG representative responded requesting that Badin sign a risk warning statement.  Badin forwarded the unsigned form to an email address belonging to Bovorn or his 

company, Nizza Plastics (the ﬁN
izza Plastics email accountﬂ). 
 Shortly thereafter, the Nizza 
Plastics email account sent Badin the execute
d form, purportedly beari
ng Badin™s signature. 27. Later that day, Badin emailed the DMG re
presentative and requested to convert the entire account balance to U.S. dollars.  The DMG representative requested that Badin sign a 
currency conversion authorization.  Badin agai
n forwarded the unsigned form to the Nizza 
Plastics email account and minutes later, the 
Nizza Plastics email account responded with the 
executed document, again purporte
dly bearing Badin™s signature. 28. Later that day, Bovorn, using an email acc
ount that he maintained for personal 
and business purposes (ﬁBovorn™s email accountﬂ), se
nt an email to the DMG representative and 
inquired, ﬁPls check whether we can do margin trad
e on this stock for me.ﬂ  Shortly thereafter, 
Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to purchased 15,000 Smithfield shares, paying 
$388,741.50, or $25.92 per share.   D. Nomura Account  29. Over the next two weeks, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased an additional 23,100 Smithfield shares in an account held in their father™s name at Capital 
Nomura Securities PCL (ﬁNomuraﬂ) in Thaila
nd.  Bovorn exercised control over this account:  
the user login for the account was Bovorn™s 
email account and all email communications 
concerning the account, including trade confirmations, were sent to Bovorn™s email account.   
Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 9 of 17 PageID #:9  10  30. On May 9, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 4,200 Smithfield shares, paying $108,360, or $25.80 per sh
are.  The next day, May 10, 2013, a Nomura 
account representative sent a series of emails to Bovorn™s email 
account attaching analysis of Smithfield stock.   
31. On Thursday, May 16, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 12,500 Smithfield shares, payi
ng $329,500, at prices ranging from $26.30 to $26.40 
per share.  On Tuesday, May 21, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased another 6,400 Smithfield shares, paying $163,648, or $25.57 per share.   
32. All of the Smithfield stock purchases 
made in the EFG, GK GOH, DMG, and 
Nomura accounts were executed on U.S.-based exchanges. 
E. Smithfield Call Options and Single-Stock Futures 
 33. On May 9, 2013, the Investment Banker received an email attaching an 
acquisition pitch book (the ﬁpitch bookﬂ) that the Thai Investment Bank had prepared for 
Company A.  The pitch book stated that Compa
ny A™s potential acquisition of Smithfield was on 
an accelerated timetable and that Smithfield had 
already received an attractive offer from a third 
party.  The pitch book discussed Company A making an offer to acquire Smithfield at prices in a 
range of $30 to $40 per share (the ﬁtarget rangeﬂ).   34. By no later than May 10, 2013, Bovorn and Badin jointly decided to begin purchasing Smithfield call options
 and single-stock futures.  35. Equity call options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a company™s stock at a set price (the ﬁstrike 
priceﬂ) for a certain period of time (through 
ﬁexpirationﬂ).  If the call option strike price is above the price at which the underlying stock is trading, the call is ﬁout-of-the-moneyﬂ because 
it would be unprofitable to exercise the call 
Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 10 of 17 PageID #:10  11  option and pay more for the stock than it woul
d cost to purchase it on a stock market.  
Conversely, if the call option strike price is below the price at which the underlying stock is trading, the call is ﬁin-the-money.ﬂ
  If the underlying stock price goes above the strike price of the call option before expiration, the owner can either exercise the call option and acquire the stock at the strike price or sell the call option, which would have increased in value.  If the underlying stock price fails to reach the strike price and the owner has not sold the call by expiration, the call would expire worthless.   36. Single-stock futures contracts are a type 
of futures contract by which the buyer agrees to buy a specified number of shares of
 a company™s stock for a set price on a specified 
future date.  Single-stock futures typically obligate the purchaser to buy 100 shares of stock at a specified contract price.  With the exception 
of commissions, a single-
stock futures purchaser 
typically does not pay any money upf
ront at the time of purchase.  Single-stock futures are rather 
traded on margin, thus offering th
e buyer increased leverage at 
the expense of taking on greater risk.   37. On May 10, 2013, Badin sent an email to Bovorn™s email account bearing the 
subject line, ﬁCall Option,ﬂ and at
taching a link to an Investopedia article discussing the potential profits that a trader could realize by purchasing the call options of a company before it was 
acquired.  The article stated that to be profitable the call option™s strike price should be below the acquisition offer price. 38. Bovorn forwarded the email containing the 
Investopedia article to the Investment 
Banker, with whom Bovorn had been
 communicating about Smithfield.  
39.  On May 10, 2013, Bovorn and Badin submitte
d an online application to open a 
brokerage account with Interactive Brokers in Badin™s name.  Over the next several days, Bovorn 
Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 11 of 17 PageID #:11  12  and Badin exchanged emails containing research 
on the available Smithfield call options series 
with different strike prices and expirations.   40. On or about May 18, 2013, Badin received an email confirmation that the 
Interactive Brokers account had been approved to trade options and single-stock futures and immediately forwarded the email to Bovorn™s ema
il account.  Minutes later, Badin also emailed 
the secure account login information and instruct
ions to Bovorn™s email 
account, stating ﬁ[u]se this one for login everytime.ﬂ   
41. Beginning on May 21, 2013 and continuing through May 28, 2013, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 1,300 Smithfield call options w
ith a strike price of $29 and an expiration date in July 2013, 1,700 Smith
field call options with a strike price of $30 
and an expiration date in July 2013, 955 Smithfiel
d single-stock future contracts with an expiration date in July 2013, 1625 Smithfield singl
e-stock future contracts with an expiration date in September 2013, and 100 shares of Smithfi
eld common stock.  All of the call options and 
stock purchases were executed on U.S.-based exchanges.  The single-stock futures orders were all executed on OneChicago, the only U.S.-based exchange for trading single-stock futures.   42. Bovorn and Badin jointly paid $91,933.02 to purchase the call options and $2,611.82 to purchase the 100 Smithfield sh
ares.  For the single-stock futures, they were required to pay only de minimis commissions totaling ap
proximately $906 and provide margin of 20% of 
the cumulative notional value 
of the Smithfield single-stock 
futures contracts (i.e., $6,713,150) 
in the account, or approximately $1.34 million.   
43. In several instances, Bovorn caused large sums of moneyŠat least $2 million in 
totalŠto be wired from Nizza Pl
astics into the Interactive Br
okers account.  The purpose of 
Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 12 of 17 PageID #:12  13  these wires was to ensure that the account main
tained sufficient margin, as described above, to 
purchase Smithfield single-stoc
k futures contracts.   44. On May 21, 2013, Bovorn caused a bank account held in the name of Nizza 
Plastics (the ﬁNizza Plastics
 bank accountﬂ) to wire $500,000 in
to the Interactive Brokers 
account.  Later that day, Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 15 July 2013 and 215 September 2013 Smithfield singl
e-stock futures contracts.   
45. The next day, May 22, 2013, Bovorn caused the Nizza Plastics bank account to 
wire another $500,000 into the Interactive Broker
s account.  Later that day, Bovorn and Badin 
purchased or caused to be purchased 120 July 2013 and 445 September 2013 Smithfield single-
stock futures contracts.   46. On May 28, 2013Šthe last trading day before the AnnouncementŠBovorn 
caused the Nizza Plastics bank account to send tw
o wires totaling $1,000,000 into the Interactive 
Brokers account.  Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased 820 July 2013 and 710 September 2013 Smithfield single-s
tock futures contracts.   47. All of the Smithfield call options that B
ovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased were ﬁout-of-the-moneyﬂ at the tim
e of purchase with strike prices ranging from 
$29 to $30, and all of the call options contracts were set to expire on July 20, 2013.  At all times 
between May 21 and May 28, 2013, the strike prices of the call options contracts were higher than the price at which Smithfield shares were trad
ing at the time.  For that time period, the price 
of Smithfield shares ranged between an intr
aday low of $25.11 per share on May 23 and an intraday high of $26.27 per share on May 28, 2013.  Moreover, none of the call options had strike prices greater than the floor of the $30 to $40 target range contained in the pitch book received by the Investment Banker.   Case: 1:18-cv-03196 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/04/18 Page 13 of 17 PageID #:13  14  48. All of the call options that Bovorn and Badin purchased or caused to be purchased represented a substantial percentage of the total cleared vol
ume (i.e., the total number of 
transactions filled on Smithfield 
options contracts) of those options from May 21 through May 
28, 2013, as well as for the entire month of May. 
 For example, the 1,300 July $29 call options 
represented 83.12% of the total cleared volume for that series.  The 1,700 July $30 call options 
represented 99.59% of the total cleared volume.   
49. The single-stock futures purchases represented an even greater 
percentage of the market.  The purchases represented 100% of th
e total cleared volume in Smithfield single-stock 
futures.  Moreover, before those purchases, there had not been one Smithfield single-stock 
futures trade in 2013, and thus Bovorn and Badin had to effectively launch a market in the 
product.   50. In total, with the 3,000 call options (the right to purchase 100 shares per contract), 2,580 single-stock futures (the obligation to take delivery of 100 shares per contract), and the 75,000 shares, Bovorn and Badin controlled the equivalent of approximately 655,000 Smithfield 
shares or 32.5% of the average daily trading volume of 
Smithfield stock during May 2013. 
51. After the announcement of Smithfield™s 
acquisition on May 29, 2013, the value of the Smithfield securities position

109,109,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two York, Pennsylvania residents with insider trading on confidential information about the impending merger of two potato chip manufacturers.

The SEC alleges that David A. Zimliki learned from a close personal friend that potato chip manufacturer Golden Enterprises Inc. was going to merge with privately-held Utz Quality Foods, LLC. The SEC further alleges that before the merger was announced Zimliki bought shares of Golden Enterprises and tipped his friend, Russell P. Schiefer, who also bought shares. Shortly after the merger was announced, Zimliki and Schiefer each sold their Golden Enterprises shares, realizing profits of $9,319 and $5,877 respectively.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, charges Zimliki and Schiefer with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Zimliki and Schiefer agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits.

The SEC acknowledges the significant assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."," IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIASECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,Plaintiff,v.DAVID A.

Banker and Zimliki had a history, pattern, and practice of sharing private details abouttheir personal and professional lives and maintaining those confidences. In particular, Bankershared with Zimliki various details about his banking clients and related business transactions,with the expectation that any shared nonpublic information be kept confidential. Zimliki knewthat Banker expected him to keep such information confidential including by not trading on it.18. Zimliki determined from several such in-person conversations with Banker that Utz andGolden Enterprises were involved in a potential transaction along the lines of a merger,acquisition, or buyout.19. Based on this information that he understood to be nonpublic, on June 14, 2016, Zimlikipurchased 1,630 shares of Golden Enterprises stock at prices of $6.13 and $6.14 per share.20. Shortly after purchasing Golden Enterprises stock, Zimliki tipped his friend Schieferabout the transaction. Zimliki told Schiefer that he had recently talked to Banker, and thatBanker was working on a deal involving Golden Enterprises. Zimliki further told Schiefer thatGolden Enterprises would be a good investment.21. Schiefer knew Banker and considered him a friend. Schiefer also knew that Zimliki andBanker were close friends and that Utz was Banker's client.22. On July 18, 2016, based on the information Zimliki shared with him, Schiefer purchased1,333 shares of Golden Enterprises stock at a price of $7.44 per share.23. On July 19, 2016, Golden Enterprises publicly announced that it had executed a mergeragreement with Utz by which Utz would acquire all of the outstanding shares of GoldenCase 1:18-cv-00947-SHR   Document 1   Filed 05/04/18   Page 4 of 7 Enterprises for $12 per share, which represented a premium of approximately 60-percent overthe then market price.24.

110,110,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Wheaton, Illinois-based securities lawyer and his law firm for their roles in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the identity of a company's principal control person, a convicted felon who had been previously incarcerated for securities fraud.

According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Adam Tracy and his law firm, Securities Compliance Group, Ltd., were retained by a convicted felon and his company, Sonant Communications Corp., to file a registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of 10 million shares of common stock. The SEC alleges, however, that the felon asked Tracy to conceal his role with the company such that his involvement would be hidden from the SEC and the investing public. As alleged in the complaint, Tracy agreed to participate in the ruse by drafting and filing with the SEC two registration statements that omitted the felon's name, and, instead, named others, without their knowledge or consent, as being the principal officers and control persons of Sonant.

The SEC's complaint charges Tracy and Securities Compliance with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. To settle the SEC's charges, the defendants agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of permanent injunctions, disgorgement of all legal fees received in connection with the scheme with prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,655.71, a civil monetary penalty of $25,000, and a penny stock bar against Tracy. Subject to court approval of the settlements, Tracy also has consented to the entry of an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.

The investigation was conducted in the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office by Edward H. Saunders and supervised by Justin C.

Tracy, age 40, resides in Wheaton, Illinois, and is a member of theIllinois State Bar.11. Securities Compliance Group, Ltd. is a law firm based in Wheaton,Illinois, that provides advice to individuals and entities regarding federal securitieslaws. Defendant Tracy is Defendant Securities Compliance's founder, presidentand managing attorney.12. Sonant Communications Corp. is an inactive Wyoming corporationwith its principal place of business in Pompano Beach, Florida. Sonant wasformed in May 2015 to provide telecommunications services to small andmedium-sized businesses. According to the Wyoming Secretary of State'swebsite, Sonant was administratively dissolved on July 9, 2016.13. The convicted felon formed Sonant and controlled it until his death inDecember 2015. In June 2005, the convicted felon pled guilty in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York to one count of conspiracy tocommit securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud, and one count of securitiesfraud. He was thereafter sentenced to a term of incarceration in a federalcorrectional facility and ordered to pay restitution.Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 4 of 14 THE FRAUDULENT SCHEMEA. The Inception of the Scheme14. In April 2015, the convicted felon communicated with the Defendantsand sought their legal assistance in (a) preparing and filing Sonant's Form S-1registration statement with the Commission, which would enable Sonant to offerits equity securities to investors, and (b) listing the company's equity securities onthe OTC marketplace.15. During their exchanges, the convicted felon advised the Defendantson more than one occasion that he had previously been arrested, and, because ofhis conviction, did not want to be named as an officer or director of Sonant anddid not want it to appear that he was associated with Sonant in public filings.16. For example, in one email to Defendants, the convicted felon stated,""I cannot be an officer of the company but will be management at a later date. Ihad an arrest about 10 years ago that maybe [sic] a conflict and I just don't thinkwe should deal with my past issues here.""17. In a subsequent email to Defendants, the convicted felon stated, ""Ihad an arrest like 10 years ago and it may be a conflict so leave me off of5Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 5 of 14 anything. I don't think we need to deal with my past here for this. Its [sic] notnecessary.""18. Based upon their direct dealings with the convicted felon, theDefendants knew that the convicted felon Šand no other person Šwas controllingSonant and that the convicted felon would continue to be the true principal officerfor and operate and control Sonant.19. In May 2015, the Defendants were involved in Sonant's incorporationin the State of Wyoming. Sonant's Articles of Incorporation listed the name of thecompany's purported Chief Executive Officer and included his purportedsignature. Sonant's bylaws listed the name of the company's purported Secretaryand included his purported signature. However, neither person had agreed toserve as an officer or director of Sonant, and their signatures on these documentswere forged.B. The Filing of Sonant's Materially False Registration Statement and theDefendants' Opinion Letter with the Commission20. In August 2015, the Defendants filed Sonant's false Form S-1registration statement with the Commission, which they had previously prepared.DCase 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 6 of 14 It provided that Sonant planned to issue 10 million shares of securities at anoffering price of $0.30 per share, for a total offering price of $3 million.21. Sonant's Form S-1 listed three individuals as its officers anddirectors, and was purportedly signed by two of them. However, none of themserved in the positions listed for them in the Form S-1, and their signatures wereforged.22. Defendants knew or were severely reckless in not knowing that thethree individuals listed as officers as directors in the Form S-1 had not agreed toserve as such for Sonant.23. Notwithstanding these facts, the Defendants also prepared and filedan opinion letter with the Commission, in which Defendant Tracy stated that hehad ""examined the registration statement, the articles of incorporation and bylaws,the minutes of meetings of its board of directors, as well as all other documentsnecessary to render an opinion,"" and that the ""common shares being sold pursuantto the registration statement are duly authorized.""24. When one of the individuals listed in Sonant's Form S-1 registrationstatement whose signature was forged learned of its existence, he advised theCommission that he had never performed any work for Sonant, was not associatedCase 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 7 of 14 with it and had not authorized it to use his name in connection with the Form S-1.He also contacted the convicted felon, and demanded that Sonant file an amendedForm S-1 registration statement with the Commission to remove his name fromany association with the company.C. The Filing of Sonant's False Amended Registration Statement and theDefendants' Failure to Cure.25. In September 2015, the Defendants filed Sonant's false Form S-1/Aregistration statement with the Commission that they had prepared. It listed twoindividuals as its officers and directors, and was purportedly signed by one ofthem. Although the Form S-1 /A removed the name of the individual whocomplained to the convicted felon, the filing still failed to disclose the convictedfelon's association with and control of Sonant.26. When one of the individuals listed on Sonant's Form S-1/Aregistration statement learned of its existence, he advised Defendant Tracy that hehad been erroneously identified on it without his permission and had notauthorized the use of his electronic signature on it. He requested that DefendantTracy notify the Commission of these facts and amend the Form S-1/A to clarifythat he had no association with Sonant.Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 8 of 14 27. Although Defendant Tracy advised this individual that he would doas instructed, he failed to do so. Instead, on October 15, 2015, the Defendantsrequested that the Commission withdraw Sonant's registration statement.28. On October 19, 2015, the Defendants notified the Commission thatSonant was rescinding its request to withdraw its registration statement.COUNTIAiding and Abetting Violations ofSection 17(a)(1) of the Securities ActX15 U.S.C. ~ 77q(a)(1)129.

111,111,"On May 1, 2018 a federal court in Jackson, Mississippi unsealed the Commission's previously filed fraud charges against a Mississippi company and its principal who allegedly bilked at least 150 investors in an $85 million Ponzi scheme. The defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, an asset freeze, and expedited discovery.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Arthur Lamar Adams lied to investors by telling them that their money would be used by his company, Madison Timber Properties, LLC, to secure harvest timber rights from various land owners located in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi, and promised annual returns of 12-15%. But Madison Timber never obtained any harvesting rights. Instead, Adams allegedly forged deeds and cutting agreements as well as documents purportedly reflecting the value of the timber on the land. Adams also allegedly paid early investors with later investors' funds and convinced investors to roll over their investments. According to the complaint, Adams used investors' money for personal expenses and to develop an unrelated real estate project.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday also announced criminal charges against Adams.

The SEC's complaint, filed under seal in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on April 20, 2018 and unsealed yesterday, charges Adams and Madison Timber Properties with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, i.e. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and permanently enjoined Madison Timber and Adams from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered Adams to surrender his passport. Adams and Madison Timber consented to the entry of the court order.

The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Krysta Cannon and Justin Delfino in the agency's Atlanta office and is being supervised by Peter Diskin. The SEC's litigation will be led by Shawn Murnahan and supervised by Graham Loomis, with assistance from Kristi H. Johnson, an Assistant United States Attorney in the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office from the Southern District of Mississippi. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."," T]NITED STATES DISTRTCT COURTSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPINORTHERN DI\TSIONSECTJRITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,PlaintiftvARTHURLAMARADAMS ANDMADISON TIMBER PROPERTIES, LLC,case No. 3.7 0< v-? 52'0tl f X0Defendants,Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission""), files itscomplaint and alleges that:1.

Arthur Lamar Adams, age 58, lives in Madison, Mississippi. He isthe founder and president of MT Properties.10. Madison Timber Properties, LLC is a Mississippi limited liabilitycompany that has its principal place of business in Madison, Mississippi. It iswholly-owned by Adams.STATEMENT OT'FACTS1 1. MT Properties purports to be a timber harvesting company.12. Starting in at least 2004, Defendants began raising funds through thesale of promissory note investments. The sale of these promissory notes hascontinued until April 1 9, 201 8.13. In general, the promissory notes are for a one-year period and offer anannual return of 12%-15%, which is paid back over the course of the year. At theend of the year, investors can either have their principle retumed or rolled over intoa new lnvestment14. When soliciting investors, Defendants told investors that MTProperties would use the funds to secure and harvest timber from specific tracts ofland that owned by third parties. The tracts of land were usually located in4Alabama, Florida, or Mississippi.DEFENDANTS 15. Defendants also told investors that they would generate theinvestment returns from the saie of the harvested timber. Finally, many investorselse would be able to harvest the timber on that land.16. The Proposed Defendants raised at least $85,000,000 through the saleof these securities to approximately 150 investors located primarily in thesoutheastern United States17. As part of this ""Timber Scheme"" the Proposed Defendants providesthe investor with a (1) promissory note; (2) timber deed and cutting agreement; (3)security agreement; (4) tract summary that includes the value of the timber on theproperty; and (5) a title search certificate.18. MT Properties never obtained the harvesting rights to the land asclaimed. In most cases, Adams forged the timber deed and cutting agreements.Adams also forged the documents purportedly showing the value of the timber onthe land tracks. Further, Adams would pledge the same land tracts (which he didnot actually have the rights to) to multiple parties. Finally, in most cases, thespecific land tracks did not have the value oftimber as promised or did not in facthave any harvestable timber.19. Instead of using the investor funds generated by the Timber Schemeto acquire timber rights and harvest the timber, Adams used the funds for his own5were told that they had the sole rights to the specific land tracks, and that no one benefit. Additionally, Adams began constructing real estate developments nearOxford and Starkville, Mississippi. Investors were not told about this real estatedevelopment and had no knowledge that their funds would be used support it.Further, the investors have no legal interest in the real estate developments.20. In addition, Defendants used funds from new investors to pay theretums owed to existing investors.COUNT I _ FRAUD IN THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SECURITIESViolations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder[ls U.S.C. $ 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. $ 240.10b-sl21.

115,115,"Washington D.C., April 18, 2018 - The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Memphis, Tennessee-area businessman with stealing approximately $5.7 million from a Pennsylvania company's pension plan.

According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, on three separate occasions between March 2015 and February 2016, John S. Jumper stole millions of dollars from Snow Shoe Refractories, LLC's pension plan. Jumper allegedly forged documents, including fake Board of Directors resolutions, to steal the funds. Jumper allegedly used the stolen funds to capitalize other businesses he owned, to repay personal debts and, in one instance, to invest in another business that paid a significant fee to a broker-dealer that Jumper co-owned.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced parallel criminal charges against Jumper.

The SEC's complaint charges Jumper with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties and injunctive relief. The complaint also names Alluvion Securities, LLC, American Investments Fund II, LLC, Speedee Brakes, LLC, Thousand Hills Capital, LLC and Evertone Records, LLC as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering stolen pension funds allegedly in their possession.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Peter Diskin and Grant Mogan in the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

, whose current employment status is unknown,
 had been 
employed 
from approximately 1996 until February 2017 
as a registered 
representative with various 
broker

, Jumper was CEO and a registered repre

of his wholly

, Alluvion

, and President and an 
investment adviser representative of Alluvion Investments.  Addi
tionally, Jumper 
personally invested in and assisted in the management of certain small businesses, 
and personally acted as a placement agent for the private sales of certain small 
businesses.
 22. In 2006, Jumper was hired 
to help sell Snow Shoe, a privately
-held 
bus
iness 
located in central Pennsylvania
 that makes high heat
-resistant products
.  Case 2:18-cv-02259   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 7 of 23    PageID 7 8  Jumper mark
eted the business to 
Snow Shoe Owner, 
a close acquaintance residing 
in Sarasota,
 Florida.  Snow Shoe Owner
 was an entrepreneur pri
marily engaged in 
religious 
publ
ishing and social media.
 23. In Februar
y of 2007, Snow Shoe Owner
 purchased Snow Shoe for 
approximately $8,200,000.  As consideration for arranging the purchase, Jumper 
received a $250,000 commission.
 24. As part of the
 ownership of Snow Shoe, 
Snow Shoe Owner 
also took 
over
 responsibility for the sponsorship and administration of the Snow Shoe 
Pension Plan.  At the time, the Snow Shoe Pension Plan assets (approximately 
$8,300,000) were held in custody and under the managemen
t of a bank
, and
 invested in a blende
d portfolio of fixed
 income and equity securities.
 25. Although there was a known 
shortfall of $1,800,000 in the
 Snow Shoe 
Pension Plan 
at the time of the purchase, 
at no time either before or after the 
transaction did 
Snow Shoe Owner 
ask for Jumper™s assist
ance or advice regarding 
the Pension Plan
. 26. After the Snow Shoe transaction closed, Jumper was not given a job at 
Snow Shoe, nor did he have any title or definite responsibilities with respect to 
Snow Shoe, as an employee or otherwise.  Jumper, however, did a
ct in an 
unofficial capacity, occasionally traveling to the headquarters of Snow Shoe to 
assist in transitioning the business to new ownership.

February 2016, Jumper engaged in a series of 
forgeries and unauthorized 
transactions to fraudulently transfer funds out of the Snow Shoe Pension Plan.
 II. JUMPER 
FORGES 
DOCUMENTS 
PURPORTING TO 
GIVE 
HIM 
AUTHORITY TO 
 ACT AS A 
FIDUCIARY FOR THE 
SNOW 
SHOE 
PENSION 
PLAN
.  28. On Apr
il 27, 2007, Jumper forged 
Snow Shoe Owner™s 
signature on a
 document entitled
 ﬁBoard of
 Directors Resolutionﬂ 
that 
purported to authorize the 
transfer of
 custody and management of the Snow Shoe P
ension Plan
 assets
 from 
the b
ank that had custody of the assets
 to the 
Memph
is, Tennesse
e office of a Wall 
Street broker
-dealer
, effective May
 1, 2007.
 29. In this instance, Jumper forged 
Snow Shoe Owner™s 
signature as 
ﬁAuthorized Officerﬂ and sign
ed his own name as ﬁSecretary.ﬂ
 30. That same day, Jumper signed an ﬁInstitutional Trust 
Agreementﬂ 
between the broker
-dealer
 and the Snow Shoe Pen
sion Plan.  Upon
 receipt of the 
Sno
w Shoe Pension Plan assets, the broker
-dealer, at Jumper™s direction,
 invested 
the assets 
in a model portfolio consisting 
primarily 
of fixed income and equity 
securities.
 31. Lat
er, on January 8, 2008, Jumper signed a ﬁNamed Fiduciaries and 
Authorized Signatures Info
rmationﬂ form
 as the ﬁV.P. of Financeﬂ of Snow Shoe
 and submitted it to the broker
-dealer.  Jumper signed similar forms again on 
October 26, 2012, March 20, 2014 and A
ugust 27, 2014.  Jumper, however,
 had no 
Case 2:18-cv-02259   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 9 of 23    PageID 9 10  such title nor did he have authorization from anyone at 
Snow Shoe to sign such a 
form.
 32. All of these documents were forgeries or otherwise unauthorized 
because Ju
mper had no power
 to act on behalf of 
Snow Shoe or 
the Pension Plan
. 33. At no time did Jumper have any title or position, including Secretary, 
with Snow Shoe 
or the Snow Shoe Pension Plan, or have the authority to sign the 
ﬁInstitutional Trust Agreementﬂ on behalf of the Pension Plan.
 34. Jumper did not disclose to 
anyone at Snow Shoe or the Pension Plan 
that he had taken these actions on their behalf.
 35. Later in 2008, the broker
-dealer that Jumper had chosen when 
transferring the Pension Plan funds was purchased by a bank, and the broker
-dealer 
thereafter became a wea
lth management division of that bank.

 JUMPER 
FRAUDULENTLY 
TRANSFERS 
$3 MILLION FROM THE 
SNOW 
SHOE 
 PENSION 
PLAN
 FOR 
PERSONAL
 GAIN
.  36. In early 2015, a group of business associates of Jumper, some of 
who
m worked at Alluvion 
Securities 
and Alluvion
 Investments
, LLC
 (ﬁATA 
Investorsﬂ), were in discussions to acquire an entity called American Tubing 
Arkansas, LLC (ﬁATAﬂ).  
The ATA I
nvestors planned to finance 
the tra
nsaction 
using
 a combination 
of tax credits and bank loans.
 37. At a late stage of the acqu
isition negotiations, however, the ATA 
Investors realized that they did not have sufficient capital to acquire ATA.
 Case 2:18-cv-02259   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 10 of 23    PageID 10 11  38. When Jumper became aware of the shortfall, he offered to provide 
the 
funds to complete the acquisition financing.  On 
March 20, 2015, using 
his forged
 fiduciary authority over the Snow Shoe Pension Plan, Jumper instruc
ted the 
transfer of $3,000,000
 to an investment vehicle entity owned by the ATA Investors 
called American Inve
stments Fund I, LLC (ﬁAIF Iﬂ). 
 39. Jumper drafted a letter on Snow Shoe
 letterhead to
 the 
wealth 
management division of the 
bank that had custody of
 the 
Snow Shoe Pension Plan
 assets 
authorizing the transfer
.  Jumper signed the letter as ﬁVice President.ﬂ
 40. In return for the funds from the Snow Shoe 
Pension Plan, AIF I issued 
a 10-year promissory note at 8% interest to the Snow Shoe Pension Pl
an.  AIF I 
then used
 the funds to complete the acquisit
ion of ATA in late March 2015
. 41. Jumper directly prof
ited from the ATA acquisition. 
 Jumper arranged 
for payments to his br
oker
-dealer, 
Alluvion
 Securities
, which were purportedly for 
ﬁservicesﬂ it rendered in connection with 
the ATA transaction.
  The contract with 
ATA provided for and resulted in payments to Alluvion Securities of 3% of the 
acquisition price of ATA (
which amounted to 
$540
,000
 in ill
-gotten gains
) and an 
ongoing $40
,000 monthly ﬁmonitoring fee.ﬂ
 42. Jumper was not, and had never been, a ﬁVice Presidentﬂ for Snow 
Shoe.  No one at Snow Shoe 
or the Pension Plan 
with authority to authorize any 
Case 2:18-cv-02259   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 11 of 23    PageID 11 12  transfers from the Snow Shoe Pension

TRANSFERS 
ANOTHER 
$2 MILLION FROM THE

PLAN FOR 
PERSONAL 
GAIN
.  43. On November 20, 2015, Jumper misappropriated an additional 
$2,000,000 from the
 Snow Shoe Pension Plan
. 44. On that day, Jumper submitted a letter on Snow Shoe
 letterhead to 
the 
Snow Shoe Pension Plan 
custodian
 outlining the creation of a so
-called ﬁseparate 
trust,ﬂ with Jumper appointed as the ﬁsuccessor trusteeﬂ to 
the new
 trust.
  Reli
ef Defendant AIF II is an LLC Jumper formed in August 2015 that became the 
vehicle for the ﬁseparate trust.ﬂ  Jumper is the principal owner of AIF II.  
 45. Jumper signed this letter as ﬁVice Presidentﬂ of Snow Shoe.  
Jumper 
attached to t
he letter phony 
board 
resolutions,
 on which Jumper forged 
Snow Shoe 
Owner™
s signature, authorizing the creation of the 
AIF II 
separate trust and the 
transf
er of $2,000,000 in Pension Plan funds to that trust.
 46. As before, Jumper was not, and had never been, a ﬁVice Presidentﬂ 
for
 Snow Shoe.  No one at Snow Shoe or the Pension Plan authorized the creation 
of a separate trust, or appointed Jumper as a trustee.
 47. The board resolutions were falsified, as no one at Snow Shoe with 
authorization to make any of these arrangements signed the
 resolutions.  Jumper 
Case 2:18-cv-02259   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 12 of 23    PageID 12 13  did not have 
Snow Shoe Owner™s 
permission to sign on his behalf, nor did Jumper 
ever disclose to 
Snow Shoe Owner 
that Jumper had done so.
 48. Jumper never disclosed these acts to any representative of Snow Shoe 
or its Pension Plan.
 49. In exc
hange for the $2,000,000, the Snow Shoe Pension Plan received 
a promissory note from 
AIF II.  
The note provided for deferred 8% in
terest per 
annum for 10 years.
 50. The first payment under the note was due on November 18, 2017.  
Upon information and belief
, no
 interest or other payments have been made in 
accorda
nce with the terms of the note.
 51. After submitting the forged documents, 
Jumper began using AIF II as 
a means to misappropriate funds from the Snow Shoe Pension Plan.
 52. Jumper 
first 
instructed 
the bank to tr
ansfer 
$2,000,000 from the 
Pension Plan into a bank 
account owned by AIF II.
  He then 
transfer
red 
some of 
the $2,000,000 
from AIF II
 to bank accounts 
belonging to
 other 
Jumper
-owned 
businesses 
or Jumper™s personal

ts, where the money was used fo

.  53. On February 16, 2016, 
Snow Shoe Owner 
was informed by an actuary 
to the Snow Shoe Pension Plan 
that a total of $5,000,000 had been 
transferred out 
of the plan by Jumper between March and November 2015
. 54. Snow Shoe Owner 
contacted Jumper 
to inquire about the whereabouts 
of the missing funds.  Jumper responded that the funds were invested in 
promissory notes.
  He did not disclose that he 
had forged 
Snow Shoe Owner™s 
signature and/or created fake documents to effect the fraudulent transfers, nor did 
he disclose the personal financial gain he had derived from those transfers.
 55. Two days later
, Jumper ordered the transfer of an additional $700,
000 
from the Snow Shoe Pension Plan to AIF II in exchange for another promissory 
note with the same terms as the previous AIF II note
.  The first payment under thi
s new note was
 due on February 18, 2018.
  Upon information and belief, no interest 
or other p
ayments have been made in accordance with the terms of the note.
 56. In order to effectuate this final transfer, Jumper again drafted a letter 
on Snow Shoe letterhead to 
the Pension Plan™s custodian bank 
outlining the terms 
of 
the transfer to a 
ﬁseparate trust
ﬂ a
nd signed as ﬁVice President.ﬂ
 57. Jumper again
 submitted phony b
oard resolutions authorizing the 
transfer, and again for
ged 
Snow Shoe Owner™s 
signature on them.
 Case 2:18-cv-02259   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 14 of 23    PageID 14 15  58. As before, Jumper was not, and had never been, a ﬁVice Presidentﬂ 
for Snow Shoe.  No one at Sno
w Shoe or the Pension Plan authorized the creation 
of a separate trust.
 59. The board resolutions were falsified, as no one at Snow Shoe with 
authorization to make any of these arrangements signed the resolutions.  Jumper 
did not have 
Snow Shoe Owner™s 
permiss
ion to sign on his behalf, nor did Jumper 
ever disclose to Snow Shoe Owner
 that Jumper had done so.

116,116,"The SEC's complaint alleges that, from at least February 2015, Amrit J. S. Chahal, of Fairfax, Va., used his company, Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC, to fraudulently solicit approximately $1.4 million from about 50 individuals, including friends and family members. According to the complaint, Chahal lured investors by falsely claiming to be an experienced and successful trader who could generate above-market returns for clients through a low-risk trading strategy. The SEC alleges that, in reality, Chahal had substantially no experience working in the financial or securities industry or trading securities on behalf of clients. The complaint further alleges Chahal initially invested client funds in a variety of investments, but suffered significant trading losses. According to the complaint, instead of disclosing the losses, Chahal lied to his clients about their investment returns, continued raising funds, then used the money for his personal benefit, including to pay for his luxury car, rent, travel, dining, and other living expenses, and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia also announced criminal charges against Chahal. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission also charged Chahal.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on April 12, 2018, charges Chahal with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and penalties.

The SEC's continuing investigation was conducted by Christine R. O'Neil and Brendan P. McGlynn in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC's litigation will be led by Christopher R. Kelly and Sarah Hall and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and the Virginia State Corporation Commission."," IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Plaintiff,  
   Jury Trial Demanded v.   AMRIT J. S. CHAHAL, 
  Defendant.      COMPLAINT 
  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commi
ssion (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges as follows: SUMMARY  1. This matter involves a fraudulent investment
 scheme orchestrated by Amrit J. S. 
Chahal (ﬁChahalﬂ) through his unregistered, Fairfax, Virginia-based company, Kane Capital 
Investment Group, LLC (ﬁKane Capitalﬂ). 
2. From at least February 2015 through Febr

turns, which prompted some clients to invest even more money 
in his fraudulent investment scheme.   
4. Additionally, Chahal used money that he 
should have been investing on behalf of his clients for his own personal benefit, including to pay for his luxury car, rent, travel, dining, and other living expenses.  Chahal also used new investment money to make payments to prior 
clients in the nature of a Ponzi scheme. 
5. As a result of the conduct described in this complaint, Chahal violated Section 
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁEx
change Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1), 80b-6(2)].

things, certain of the acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations of the federal securities laws alleged herein 

occurred within the Easter
n District of Virginia.  DEFENDANT 
9. Amrit J. S. Chahal, age 30, resides in Fairfax, Virginia.  Chahal is the President, Chief Executive Officer, and sole employee of Ka
ne Capital.  Chahal has never held any securities licenses, nor has he ever been associat
ed with a registered broker-dealer or investment 
adviser other than Kane Capital.   RELATED ENTITY 10. Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC is a Virginia limited liability company 
formed by Chahal in December 2014 located in Fa
irfax, Virginia.  Kane Capital has never been registered with the Commission or any state secu
rities regulatory authority in any capacity.   FACTS 
The Fraudulent Investment Scheme  11. In December 2014, Chahal formed Kane Cap
ital with substantially no experience 
working in the financial or securities industry or trading securities on behalf of clients.   12. By February 2015, Chahal began asking friends and family members to give him 
money to trade in, among other thin
gs, securities on their behalf.   13. In exchange for his investment advisory
 services, Chahal said that he would 
charge two fees:  (1) an annual fee of 2.5%; and (2) a performance-
based fee equal to 10% of an investor™s returns that exceeded an
 annual return of 30 percent.  
Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 3 of 11 PageID# 3 4  14. Chahal™s clients provided him with 
money for the purpose of purchasing and selling options, futures, and commodities, th
ereby putting such investments at risk.   
15. Chahal pooled client funds in multiple br
okerage accounts, and used such funds to 
trade in options, futures, and commodities as well as, as described below, to fund his personal lifestyle and to make Ponzi-like payments to other 
investors.  Chahal™s profits also were derived from his clients™ investment returns.   
16. Clients of Kane Capital expected profits through Chahal™s investment efforts on 
their behalf.   17. In seeking investments, Chahal told pros
pective clients that Kane Capital would 
open brokerage accounts in their name, and tr
ade in a mix of options, futures, and/or 
commodities as part of a low-risk, high-freque
ncy trading strategy.  Chahal, however, rarely 
opened separate brokerage accounts 
on behalf of each of his clients as promised.  Instead, he 
commingled client funds in multiple brokerage acc
ounts held in his own name or in the name of 
Kane Capital. 
18. Chahal also directed prospective clie
nts to Kane Capital™s website, which included multiple statements about Kane Capital™
s investment strategy.  Through Kane Capital™s 
website, Chahal falsely claimed, 
among other things, that the comp
any ﬁuses the latest software to achieve the highest possible profit from each 
investment, often times within nano seconds,ﬂ 
and ﬁspecializes in selecting low-risk/high-yield investment opportunities.ﬂ   
19. In reality, Chahal personally traded risky options on margin and purchased and 
sold futures and commodities, as opposed to purchasing and selling low-risk/high-yield investments with the aid of hi
gh-frequency trading software. Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 4 of 11 PageID# 4 5  20. Chahal also guaranteed prospective invest
ors the return of th
eir principle, and claimed that ﬁeach of [Kane Capital™s] investment
s are carefully reviewed by industry experts.ﬂ  
No industry experts ever approved Kane Capital™s investments. 
21. Based upon these misrepresentations and t
hose described below, friends, family 
members, and others gave Chahal their money to
 invest in the fraudulent scheme.  Chahal and 
Kane Capital ultimately lost a significant 
portion of their clients™ investment funds. 
Chahal Misrepresented Kane Capital™s Investment Returns 
22. Chahal touted both his personal trading successes and Kane Capital™s historical trading performance to Kane Capital 
clients and prospective clients.   23. Chahal represented to one of his investors that Kane Capital averaged ﬁbetween 
like 28 percent to 30, 34 percent return per year.ﬂ  Chahal further stated that Kane Capital managed over $5 million of investor funds.  Both of these statements were false. 
24. By the end of 2015, Chahal had raised at 
least $430,000 from investors.  Of that amount, Chahal transferred approximately $207,000 
into a brokerage account in the name of 
Kane Capital, traded those investment funds, 
and suffered trading losses of approximately $178,000, or 86% of his clients™ investments.  Rather than cea
sing his investment scheme, 
Chahal continued to raise about $1 million more in investments. 
25. In order to do so, instead of disclosing these losses, Chahal repeatedly 
misrepresented Kane Capital™s re
turns to solicit new funds from 
prospective clients and to lull current clients, many of whom invested additional funds.   
26. Through Kane Capital™s website, Chahal granted clients access to a secure portal through which they could obtain information about 
their accounts.  Chahal falsified the account 
balances and quarterly statements that client
s were able to access through the portal.   Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 5 of 11 PageID# 5 6  27. In one of the few instances in which he opened a brokerage account in the name 
of a client, for example, Chahal fabricated the 
brokerage statement for that account to reflect a 
balance of $206,043.63 when, in reality, the account held only $1,043.63.   
28. To deceive some of his other clients,
 Chahal created a fraudulent brokerage 
statement for a nonexistent account showing a balance of $71,077.63.   
Chahal Misappropriated Client Funds and Made Ponzi-like Payments to Other Investors 
 29. Chahal also used a significant portion of new client funds for his personal benefit, and to pay earlier investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme.   
30. Chahal used client funds to pay for, among other things, his luxury car, rent, travel, dining, and other living expenses. 31. In the days following a deposit of invest
or funds into Kane Capital™s checking account, Chahal routinely made paym
ents to earlier investors.   32. For example, on November 15, 2016, Chahal deposited $35,000 of client 
investments into Kane Capital™s primary bank a
ccount, which, at the time, held approximately 
$1,700.  Over the next few days, Chahal issued checks totaling $20,000 to two investors referencing ﬁpartial withdrawﬂ and ﬁaccount closure.ﬂ   CHAHAL VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 
33. During the relevant period, Chahal owned, operated, and controlled Kane Capital. 34. Chahal made purchases, offers, and sales of 
securities on behalf of clients of Kane Capital. 
35. Chahal exercised control over what purchas
es and sales were made with client 
funds, and acted as an investment adviser. 
Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 6 of 11 PageID# 6 7  36. In connection with his purchases, offers, and sales, Chahal made use of the means 
and instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails, 
including the use of the internet and interstate phone calls. 37. All of the misrepresentations and omissions set forth herein, i
ndividually and in the aggregate, are material, and were made in conn
ection with and in the purchase, offer, or sale of securities.  There is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the misrepresented facts and omitted informationŠi
ncluding, among other items, misrepresentations 
and omissions concerning Chahal
™s trading experience, clients™
 investment returns, and the 
misappropriation of and Ponzi-like payments 
with investor fundsŠimportant in deciding 
whether or not to invest with Chahal and Kane Ca
pital, and that the accurate facts would alter the 
ﬁtotal mixﬂ of information available. 
38. In connection with the conduct described herein, Chahal acted knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.  Among other things, 
Chahal knew, was reckless, or should have known that he was making material misrepresent
ations and omitting to state material facts 
necessary to make certain stat
ements not misleading under the ci
rcumstances in connection with 
and in the purchase, offer, or sale of securities. 
39. Through his material misrepresentations
 and omissions, Chahal obtained money 
or property. 40. Through this scheme, Chahal engaged in acts, transactions or courses of business 
that operated as a fraud or deceit upon offerees, purchasers and prospective purchasers of securities.

Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1-1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 1 of 1 PageID# 12"
118,118,"On April 5, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York resident with tipping his brother and father with material nonpublic information about an upcoming corporate acquisition.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, in 2014, Saverio J. Barbera (""Barbera""), learned that Owens & Minor, Inc., a Virginia-based healthcare logistics company, was going to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Medical Action Industries, Inc. (""Medical Action""), a Brentwood, New York, medical products supplier. According to the complaint, Barbera then told his father and brother that they should purchase Medical Action stock in advance of the acquisition so that they could profit from the deal. The SEC alleges that Barbera obtained the information that he tipped to his father and brother from his close friend, the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Medical Action. According to the SEC's complaint, soon after receiving this tip and less than a week before the public announcement of the deal, Barbera's father and brother purchased a combined total of 22,000 shares of Medical Action common stock, which they then sold at a profit following the deal's announcement. The SEC alleges that, as a result of their trading, Barbera's father and brother realized combined trading profits of approximately $145,000.

Barbera has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying a penalty of $289,650.72, an amount which is twice the trading profits of his father and brother. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Barbera has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John O'Halloran and H.B. Roback of the SEC's Atlanta Office, and is being supervised by Stephen E. Donahue and Aaron W. Lipson also of the SEC's Atlanta Office. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the FINRA in this matter."," Stephen E. Donahue John O™Halloran Harry B. Roback Attorneys for the Plaintiff

121,121,"A petroleum engineer who worked at Texas-based energy company Apache Corporation has agreed to settle SEC charges that he conducted insider trading ahead of a market-moving announcement about the company's discovery of a significant new oil source.

The SEC alleges in its complaint, filed on November 1, 2017, that Christopher J. Lollar traded on nonpublic information while working in the company's San Antonio office that was performing the geologic and geophysical work to explore and develop the newly-discovered resource play called Alpine High. Lollar allegedly conducted trades in Apache shares and call options in the days and weeks leading up to the company's Alpine High announcement on Sept. 7, 2016. The value of Lollar's brokerage account skyrocketed approximately 2,700 percent after the announcement, and his alleged profits from insider trading totaled $214,295.07.

The SEC's complaint charges Lollar with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Lollar consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and orders him to pay disgorgement of $214,295.07 plus $7,219.36 in interest and a $214,295.07 penalty for a total of $435,809.50.

Complaint 
 DEFENDANT
 9. Christopher J. Lollar, age 29, resides in Houston, Texas.  From January 2014 
until June 2017, Lollar was a petroleum engineer
 for Apache Corporation.  From January 2014 
through December 2016, he worked in Apache™s 
San Antonio, Texas office.  In January 2017, Lollar relocated to Apache™s Houston, Texas headquarters where he worked until the company 
terminated him in June 2017 for breaching its 
Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business 
Conduct.   RELATED ENTITY 10. Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an independent energy company that explores
 for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.  At all relevant times, Apache™s co
mmon stock was registered with 
the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the 
Exchange Act and was quoted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ﬁAPA.ﬂ 
STATEMENT OF FACTS  Lollar Joins Apache as a Petroleum Engineer 
11. After interning with Apache during the summers of 2012 and 2013, Lollar went to 
work for the company full-time in January 2014 
as a petroleum engineer in the Petroleum 
Engineering Development Program.  At the time he
 made the illegal trades, Lollar worked in the 
Unconventional Resource Drilling Department (ﬁ
URD Departmentﬂ) in Apache™s San Antonio 
office. 
12. Upon accepting his internships and full-
time position with the company, Lollar 
acknowledged in writing that he had read, and agreed to abide by, Apache™s corporate codes and policies, including its Code of Business Conduct and Insider Trading Policy.   Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 3 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar
  Page 4 of 12 
Complaint 
 13. Apache™s Code of Business Conduct prohibited Lollar from ﬁusing corporate 
property, information or position for personal gain.ﬂ
  It also prohibited Lollar from disclosing 
confidential information and from appropriati
ng such information for his own use.   
14. Apache™s Insider Trading Policy prohibit
ed Lollar from trading on material, 
nonpublic information learned thr
ough employment with the co
mpany.  The policy included a 
non-exhaustive list of the type of information 
the company considers to be material, including 
ﬁsignificant expansion or curtailment of operationsﬂ and 
ﬁsignificant new services or 
discoveries.ﬂ  Apache™s Insider Trading Policy specifically warned Lollar about trading ahead of 
import newsŠlike the Alpine High Announcemen
tŠcautioning that ﬁ[p]erhaps the most dangerous time to engage in a purchase or sale 
of Apache securities is sh
ortly in advance of a public release of important 
material information–.ﬂ  
Background on Apache™s Decision to Announce the Alpine High 
15. From approximately 2014 through mid-2016, Apache worked to develop the 
Alpine High resource play through extensive geologic and geophysical work, land accumulation, 
strategic testing and delineation drilling.  On July 14, 2016, Apache personnel gave a presentation on the Alpine High to Apache™s Board of Directors and certain senior executives (the ﬁBoard Presentationﬂ).  A group of seven San Antonio-based engineers and geologists who had worked on developing the Alpine High, and with whom Lollar worked, assisted in the 
preparation of the Board Presentation.  It was made clear to the employees working on the Board 
Presentation that the presentation was confidential.  Although Lollar worked with these employees, he did not work on the Board Presentation. 
16. After the Board Presentation, Apache made 
the decision to publicly announce the Alpine High resource play.  Between August 25, 2016 and September 2, 2016, Apache drafted a 
press release which it planned to issue on September 7, 2016, before the company™s CEO 
Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 4 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar

Complaint 
 presented at the 2016 Barclays CEO Energy-Powe
r Conference (the ﬁB
arclays Conferenceﬂ).  Certain company executives, outside financial consultants, and employees specializing in public and investor relations were provided drafts of the press release and the Barclays Conference presentation for their review and comment be
fore both were finalized on September 6, 2016.   
17. At 6:40 a.m. (ET), before the markets opened on September 7, 2016, Apache 
made the Alpine High Announcement.  In response 
to the news, Apache™s stock traded as high as $58.99 per share on September 7, 2016 before clos
ing at $55.13 per shareŠan approximately 
6.7% increase from the prior day™s closing shar
e price of $51.67.  Trading volume that day also 
increased dramatically to over 14.5 million shares
 compared with Apache™s historical average 
daily volume of approximately 2.7 million shar
es for the month preceding the Alpine High 
Announcement. 
Lollar™s Illegal Trading in Apache Securities 18. In the days and weeks following Apache™s decision to announce the Alpine High, Lollar traded Apache securities 
in two brokerage accounts: (1) his Fidelity Roth IRA account 
ending 9413 (the ﬁFidelity accountﬂ); and (2
) his OptionsHouse account ending 0573 (the 
ﬁOptionsHouse accountﬂ).   Trading in the Fidelity Account 19. Lollar opened the Fidelity account on February 24, 2016.  There is no evidence that Lollar traded in Apache securities
 in the Fidelity account
 prior to August 2016. 
20. In August 2016, Lollar sold all of the securities he held in the Fidelity account.  He used the proceeds from that sale, and almost 
all the cash in the account,
 to purchase a total of 
461 shares of Apache common stock on August 18 and 23, 2016, at a total cost of approximately 

$24,580.60 (excluding commissions or ot
her transaction fees).  He made these purchases after 
the Board Presentation and Apache™s decision to publicly announce the Alpine High.  Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 5 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar
  Page 6 of 12 
Complaint 
 21. On September 9, 2016, two days after 
the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar 
sold all 461 shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $26,954.67 and a net profit of 
$2,374.07.   Trading in the OptionsHouse Account 22. Lollar opened the OptionsHouse account on January 16, 2015.  Prior to 
September 6, 2016, no Apache securities were trad
ed in the OptionsHouse account.      
23. On September 1, 2016, in a recorded tele
phone call to OptionsHouse™s customer 
service department, Lollar expressed concern 
about a notice he received that a $5,000 incoming 
electronic transfer or deposit request (the ﬁDeposit Requestﬂ) into the OptionsHouse account would not be available until September 8, 2016. 
 Lollar asked that the Deposit Request be 
cancelled and that a wire transfer be initiated the next day (September 2, 2016) so that the funds 
would be available immediately for a trade he 
wanted to make ﬁon [the] open of next week 
which would be Tuesday, the 7th [of September].ﬂ
1  Lollar was told the Deposit Request was still 
in progress and that there might be
 a chance it could be cancelled.   
24. OptionsHouse did in fact cancel the Deposit Request.  OptionsHouse account records reflect that $5,000 was deposited in Lollar™s account on September 2, 2016.  An 
additional $1,200 was wired into Lollar™s Op
tionsHouse account on September 6, 2016.  That 
same day, Lollar used the wired funds and ex
isting margin funds to
 purchase 490 Apache call option contracts in the OptionsHouse account
 at a cost of approximately $7,275.00.   
25. The options had an expiration date of September 9, 2016, and strike prices that 
varied between $52.50 and $53.50.  Apache™s stock price on September 6, 2016 opened at 
                                                 1  On this call, Lollar incorrectly stated that the following Tuesday was September 7th.  In fact, he needed the 
funds available to purchase the three-day options contracts on Tuesday, September 6, 2016, in advance of Apache™s 
Alpine High Announcement, which took
 place before the markets opened on 
Wednesday, September 7, 2016.  The 
markets were closed on Monday, September 5, 2016, for the Labor Day holiday.   
Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 6 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar

Complaint 
 $51.38, had a high of $52.00 and closed at $51.67, thus the three-day options were out-of-the-money when Lollar bought them.  For Lollar™s ca
ll options to be in-the-money on September 6, 
2016, Apache™s closing stock price would have ha
d to have been higher by between $.84 to $1.84, or 1.6% and 3.7%, respectively, as summarized below:

$53.50 350 $51.67 $1.84 3.7% 
26. As this chart shows, Lollar expected 
a market moving event to take place in 
connection with Apache™s stock before Septembe
r 9, 2016.  Notably, Apache had no earnings or other announcements scheduled between September 6 and 9, 2016.  On September 6, 2016, 

Apache announced on its Facebook page and LinkedIn account that Apache™s CEO would be 

making a presentation at the Barclays Confer
ence on September 7, 2016, but no specifics were provided about the content of the presentation.      27. On September 7, 2016, later the same da
y of the Alpine High Announcement, 
Lollar sold all 490 Apache call option contracts, resulting in to
tal proceeds of approximately 
$219,196.00, and profits of approximately $211,921.00.  Th
ese profits far exceeded the profits of 
any of Lollar™s other options trading in the OptionsHouse account since its inception in January 2015. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 7 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar

 28. Because of the high percentage change 
in the value of the OptionsHouse account,
2 OptionsHouse opened its own internal fraud investigation into Lollar™s trading in Apache 
securities on September 8, 2016.  OptionsHouse u
ltimately closed Lollar™s account on September 
12, 2016, and he was informed of its decision on September 20, 2016.

Lollar™s Inside Information 
30. Lollar had ample opportunity to learn inside information about the impending 
Alpine High Announcement through his work as a pe
troleum engineer for Apache.  At the time 
                                                 2  The value of Lollar™s OptionsHouse account increased by approximately 2,700% between September 6, 
2016 (account value of $7,478) and September 7, 2016 (account value of $212,639.41).   
Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 8 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar
  Page 9 of 12 
Complaint 
 he made the illegal trades, Lollar was working 
in the URD Department in Apache™s San Antonio 
office where the geologic and geophysical work that went into developing the Alpine High occurred.  In this position, Lollar worked alongside the team of
 engineers and geologists that were actively working on the development of the Alpine Hig
h.  During the course of his employment, Lollar had regular contact wit
h, and access to, many of the engineers and 
geologists that assisted in preparing the Board Presentation.  He also would have been provided high level information about the development of
 the Alpine High through staff meetings and 
daily email reports.  
31. In addition to Lollar™s suspiciously timed
 trades and his access to Apache™s San 
Antonio-based URD Department, it 
is clear that Lollar illegally 
traded based on material, non-
public information because:  
a. Lollar liquidated all the securities in his Fidelity account and used the proceeds, along with almost all the availa
ble cash in the account, to purchase Apache stock shortly before the Alpine High Announcement; 
b. Lollar used almost all of the availa
ble funds in his OptionsHouse account to purchase Apache stock options.  No other securities were held, acquired, or sold in September 2016 in the OptionsHouse account; 
c. Lollar™s September 1, 2016 telephone call to OptionsHouse revealed that 
he was concerned about transferring funds into the OptionsHouse account prior to September 6th so he could purchase the cal
l option contracts before the Alpine High Announcement; 
d. Lollar purchased out-of-the-money call 
option contracts with a three-day 
expiration period, evidencing a high degree of confidence in the likely outcome of the 
trade; 
Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 9 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar

Complaint 
 e. The accounts in which Lollar made th
ese purchases never maintained a 
position in Apache securities prio
r to the subject purchases;  
f. When questioned about the trades by Commission staff, Lollar made many 
statements that were contradicted by 
information found in the public domain and 
elsewhere; and  g. Apache terminated Lollar in June 
2017 for breaching the company™s Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   32. In short, Lollar was willing to liquidate his Fidelity account to purchase Apache 
stockŠwhich he had never purchased in that account beforeŠand was willing to bet all of the 
funds in his OptionsHouse account on a rapid incr
ease in the price of Apache stock in just a 
three-day time frame.  He was only willing to make 
this bet because of the inside information he 
had obtainedŠthat Apache was about to make 
a major public announcement about the Alpine 
High play.  He then used that inside informa
tion to make illegal insider trades and realized 
substantial profits as a result.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 12 of 12"
123,123,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Westchester, New York-based investment adviser with fraud stemming from lies to retail investors about the value of their investments in a Ponzi-like scheme.

The SEC alleges that, starting in approximately 2010, Michael Scronic began to raise money from at least 42 friends and acquaintances, many of whom were from his suburban community, in order to invest in a risky options trading strategy. He allegedly lured investors by informing them that he had a long and impressive track record of proven returns. He also allegedly lied to investors about the liquidity of investments, telling one investor that ""what's cool about my fund is that i'm [sic] only in publicly traded options and cash so any redemptions are met within 2 business days so if you do need to withdraw for your business needs it will be quick and painless."" However, the SEC alleges that Scronic was actually hemorrhaging investor money through massive trading losses, with at least $15 million in investment losses since April 2010. For the period ending June 30, 2017, Scronic allegedly reported to investors total assets of at least $21,837,475. However, the balance in his brokerage account on June 30, 2017 was just under $27,500.

According to the SEC's complaint, when certain investors attempted to redeem their investments, Scronic did not disclose his inability to repay them. Rather, he allegedly provided investors with a steady stream of implausible excuses for why he could not pay them back. In other instances, Scronic sought to obtain additional investment funds from new and existing investors in order to satisfy redemption requests from other investors. The SEC also alleges that Scronic began identifying himself as an investment adviser to a fictitious hedge fund in which he purported to sell interests, or ""shares.""

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Scronic.

The SEC's complaint charges Scronic with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and penalties against Scronic.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Lindsay S. Moilanen, Daphne Downes, and Sheldon L. Pollock, and the case was supervised by Ms. Mehraban. The litigation will be led by Nancy A. Brown and Ms. Moilanen. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."," Lara S. MehrabanSheldon L.

Since April 2010, Scronic's personal brokerage account, in which he depositedinvestor funds, has had cumulative deposits of $20.8 million, withdrawals of $2.9 million, andnet investment losses of $15.8 million.l He lost 88% of net investor deposits in trading lossesbetween Apri12010 and August 2017, experiencing losses in 79 out of the 89 months.Short of assets to honor investor requests for redemptions, Scronic resorted topaying them off with new monies raised from new or existing investors.6. In addition to the lies Scronic told to entice further investments, Scronic also sentmaterially false quarterly updates to existing investors about the status of their investments.According to the quarterly statements for the period ending June 30, 2017, Scronic reported toinvestors total assets of at least $21,837,475.7. However, the balance in his brokerage account on June 30, 2017 was slightly lessthan $27,500.More recently, with little cash left in his investment account, Scronic has resistedinvestor redemption requests. On or about August 8, 2017, one of Scronic's investors, InvestorA, attempted to redeem his $200,000 investment with Scronic, plus the gains Scronic attributedto that investment. Investor A had signed an investment agreement with Scronic providing athree-day redemption period. Scronic has deflected Investor A's redemption requests, offering aseries of excuses for his failure to return Investor A's money.

Defendant, directly and indirectly, has made use of the means andinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails and wires, and/or of the facilities of anational securities exchange in connection with transactions, acts, practices, and courses ofbusiness alleged herein.DEFENDANT16. Scronic, age 46, resides in Pound Ridge, New York. Scronic was a registeredrepresentative associated with Morgan Stanley from August 1998 to October 2005. Scronic isnot currently registered in any capacity with the Commission. Scronic received anundergraduate degree from Stanford University and a master's degree from the University ofChicago.C!Case 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 4 of 14 RELEVANT ENTITY17. Scronic Macro Fund, a/k/a Scronic Fund, (""SMF""), is the name of the fictitioushedge fund for which Scronic claimed to be an investment adviser. Certain statements andcommunications to investors refer to their ""shares"" in SMF. Neither Scronic Macro Fund norScronic Fund is registered with the Commission in any capacity. Neither Scronic Macro Fundnor Scronic Fund is a formal corporate entity. Rather, SMF is a nominee name used by Scronicto perpetrate his fraud.FACTSI. DEFENDANT'S FRAUDULENT OFFERING18. Scronic solicited friends and acquaintances, many from his suburban community,to invest in SMF, a fictitious hedge fund he claimed to manage.19. As of June 30, 2017, Scronic had at least 42 investors. Investment amountsvaried per investor from $23,000 to $2.4 million.20. Scronic asked investors to wire money to one of his personal checking accounts,but sometimes also accepted checks for deposit in those checking accounts. Scronic thentransferred those funds to his personal brokerage account. Scronic never segregated the investormoney by investor.21. Scronic entered into investment agreements with many of his investors. Thoseagreements provide that:• monies will be invested in SMF;• Scronic is acting as an investment adviser;• Scronic will provide quarterly reports of investment performance for SMF as awhole and client accounts;5Case 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 5 of 14 • SMF will invest in options markets;• fees will be 1 % of assets under management plus 20% of profits;• investors can redeem in three business days;• Scronic is in compliance with all federal and state laws pertaining to the operationof a fund; and• Scronic has a fiduciary duty to his investors.22. Scronic provided investors with quarterly account statements. These updatesgenerally took the form of an email from Scronic's email account with aone-line computationshowing the value of the investor's initial investment, the investor's purported gain for thatquarter, and the amount of purported fees paid to Scronic. For the quarter ending June 30, 2017,Scronic began sending more traditional-looking statements, also from his email account,showing each investor's beginning account value, purported earnings during the quarter, accountvalue, number of shares purportedly held in SMF, and net asset value per share.23. Scronic also sent investors periodic updates communicating economic/marketdevelopments, his views on those developments, and his planned investment strategies. Scronicattempted to convey macroeconomic and global trends to his investors using complicatedvocabulary in an attempt to demonstrate his mastery of the markets and investment acumen.24. Throughout, Scronic used investor funds to make risky investments in equity andindex options and options on futures contracts in his personal brokerage account. He sustaineddramatic and consistent losses. Overall, since Apri12010, Scronic's brokerage account has hadcumulative deposits of $20.8 million, withdrawals of $2.9 million, and investment losses of$15.8 million. About half of the investment losses were attributable to equity or index options,and the other half were attributable to options on futures contracts.Case 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 6 of 14 25. Most recently, during the period of January 2015 through July 2017,approximately $10.4 million was deposited to Scronic's brokerage account and $2.2 million waswithdrawn, in large part in transfers to Scronic's personal bank accounts. As of the end of July2017, the brokerage account had under $6,000 in assets.II. DEFENDANT'S MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS TO INVESTORSA. General Misrepresentations and Omissions to Investors26. Despite sustaining dramatic and consistent losses in his brokerage account,Scronic falsely represented to investors that their investments with him were profitable.27. In early July 2017, Scronic provided quarterly statements to investors for thequarter ending June 30, 2017. These quarterly statements indicated SMF had aggregate holdingsof at least $21,837,475. These statements further indicated that the quarterly return for mostinvestors was about 4.8%, though one investor's statement reported a quarterly return of 10.7%.28. However, in reality, as Scronic knew or recklessly disregarded, Scronic'sbrokerage account statements reflect a balance of just under $27,500 as of June 30, 2017. 76%of that sum was in cash and 24% was a long call option.29. The quarterly investor statements prepared by Scronic also showed that during thequarter ending June 30, 2017, investors deposited $650,000 and withdrew $700,000, indicatingthat all additional money invested during that period was used to pay the redemption requests ofother investors.30. Scronic did not disclose his investment losses or his use of new investments topay redemptions to investors at any point in time.31. In quarterly statements and emails, Scronic told investors that at the end of eachquarter, he moved 97-100% of assets into cash, leaving only 0-3%invested in the markets. In7Case 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 7 of 14 other words, Scronic claimed that he harvested profits at the end of each quarter in order to resetthe profit and loss on his investments.32. However, as Scronic knew or recklessly disregarded, those statements were false.Scronic did not liquidate investments at the end of each quarter, and, in fact, was consistentlyrealizing enormous market losses in nearly every month, wiping out the majority of investorfunds.33. Scronic told investors they owned ""shares"" in SMF, and sent them quarterlystatements that showed their ""shares held"" and ""net asset value"" per share. Those statements,too, were false because, as Scronic knew or recklessly disregarded, SMF did not exist, and hehad simply commingled all of his investors' money in his own bank and brokerage accounts.B. Misrepresentations and Omissions to Investor A34. Investor A, a resident of Westchester County, invested $100,000 with Scronic inor around December 2, 2015.35. Prior to Investor A's initial investment, Scronic knowingly or recklesslyrepresented to Investor A that his strategy and portfolio had been historically profitable.Specifically, on November 30, 2015, Scronic wrote to Investor A that since 2010 ""the averagerate of return has been about 18%"" and from 2015 to date ""it stands at 21 %.""36. After Investor A's initial investment, Scronic emailed reports to Investor Ashowing quarterly investment returns of between 4-7% on his investment and for SMF overall.37. However, as detailed above in paragraphs 24-25, Scronic's representations aboutSMF's profitability were false; Scronic consistently sustained severe losses prior to and duringInvestor A's investment period.38. In June 2017, Scronic began pressuring Investor A to invest more, in order to takeE.3Case 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 8 of 14 advantage of an alleged upcoming market opportunity. Investor A sent Scronic another$100,000 in June 2017, bringing his total principal investment to $200,000.39. Prior to his first investment, Investor A had sought and received false assurancesfrom Scronic about the liquidity of his investment, which was important to Investor A because hewas starting a new business. On November 12, 2015, Scronic assured Investor A that he couldredeem quickly: ""what's cool about my fund is that I'm [sic] only in publicly traded options andcash so any redemptions are met within 2 business days so if you do need to withdraw for yourbusiness needs it will be quick and painless."" Scronic also confirmed the three-day redemptionterm orally with Scronic.40. On November 30, 2015, Investor A wrote: ""We're going to put $100k in, as longas we can redeem within a couple days['] notice ... I believe the agreement says 3 days, whichis great.""41. Scronic and Investor A then entered into a signed investment agreement onDecember 2, 2015 which included all of the provisions noted in paragraph 21 above.42. Scronic's representations that Investor A could redeem his investment on 2-3days' notice were knowingly or recklessly false.43. As of June 30, 2017, Scronic's investment account (for all investors) was valuedat only $27,376. Nonetheless, Investor A's quarterly update, prepared and sent to him byScronic in July 2017, falsely represented that, for the period ending June 30, 2017, Investor A's$200,000 investment was valued at $223,283 and 98% of that investment was held in cash.44. Believing that his investment had grown to more than $223,000, as reflected onthe quarterly statement Scronic had sent him, on or about August 8, 2017, Investor A attemptedto redeem his shares.DCase 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 9 of 14 45. In response to Investor A's August 8 redemption request and several subsequentrequests, Scronic made a variety of misleading excuses. Scronic initially told Investor A hecould not process his withdrawal for at least another two weeks, then ignored his emails, thensent an email informing Investor A of a change in his email address from Yahoo to a Gmailaccount because his Yahoo account was a mess, and finally told Investor A that redemptionscould only be made on a quarterly basis, notwithstanding his prior representations.246. In the communications about Investor A's redemptions, Scronic represented toInvestor A that the ""fund is now positive for the quarter."" Scronic's representation wasknowingly or recklessly false.47. Scronic intentionally or recklessly failed to tell Investor A that he did not havefunds to honor Investor A's redemption request.III. DEFENDANT'S USE OF INVESTOR FUNDS48. The investor funds obtained by Scronic were deposited to his various personalbank accounts. From there, he sent most of the funds to his brokerage account, losing most of itin options and futures trading.49. Scronic used other investor funds to pay his personal expenses, including at least$105,000 to pay off his personal American Express credit card bills.IV. DEFENDANT'S CONCEALMENT OF HIS SCHEME50. Scronic concealed his scheme and losses from investors. In order to perpetrate hisfraud, Scronic created a fictitious hedge fund, SMF, for which he solicited investments andScronic gave similar misleading excuses to other investors seeking to redeem some or allof their investment in July 2017, making similar false statements to reassure them that theirinvestment was safe. For example, on or about August 15, 2017, Scronic told Investor B: ""200kof yours has been siting [sic] in cash as we had talked about in June and will be redeemed aroundmonth end. The other 200k will be redeemed with regards to this new policy at quarter end."" Asof August 15, 2017, Scronic did not have $200,000 in his brokerage account.10Case 7:17-cv-07615   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 10 of 14 purported to provide account statements reflecting his fictional trading success to investors.51. Scronic also controlled multiple checking accounts, as well as his brokerageaccount. Scronic frequently moved money from one account to another in an attempt to concealthe source and use of funds from his banks and brokerage firm.52. As described above, on certain occasions when investors sought to redeem theirinvestments, Scronic either ignored their requests or made excuses for his delay in honoringthose redemptions.53. On other occasions, in order to conceal the losses in his account and pay outredemption requests, and further his fraudulent scheme, Scronic solicited new investors oradditional funds from existing investors. For example, the quarterly statements that Scronic sentto investors show that during the period ending June 30, 2017, investors deposited $650,000 andwithdrew $700,000, indicating that investor money received during that period was used to payredemption requests.FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF(Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act)54.

124,124,"On October 25, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mohammed Ali Rashid, a former senior partner at Apollo Management L.P., with defrauding his fund clients by secretly billing them for approximately $290,000 in personal expenditures, including his family vacations, visits to a hair salon, and purchases of designer clothing and high-end electronics.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid falsely claimed that certain individuals accompanied him to dinners to make it appear various personal expenses had a business purpose, and he doctored a receipt in an effort to justify his purchase of a $3,500 suit for his father as a business expense.

According to the SEC's complaint, despite being caught by the firm and told to stop on two occasions in 2010 and 2012, Rashid continued to expense personal items to clients into 2013.  After he was confronted about his expenses for a third time, Rashid admitted that he charged approximately $220,000 in personal expenses.  A forensic accountant then uncovered additional personal expenses that Rashid improperly charged to clients.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid violated, and in the alternative aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks penalties and injunctive relief."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORKSECURITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,Plaintiff,MOHAMMED ALI RASHID,Defendant.No. 17-cv-8223COMPLAINTJURY TRIAL DEMANDEDPlaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission""), for its Complaintagainst Mohammed Ali Rashid (""Rashid°' or ""Defendant""), alleges as follows:SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONSFrom at least January 2010 to June 2013 (""Relevant Period""), Rashid, anexperienced and highly compensated investment adviser for awell-known advisory firm,intentionally misappropriated approximately $290,000 from private equity funds that he advised.While acting as an investment adviser, Rashid defrauded his fund clients by using their moneyfor his personal expenses, including paying for elaborate vacations, frequent trips to anexpensive hair salon, spa services, and luxuzy retail items.2. During. tl~e Relevant Period, Rashid was a Partner and later a Senior Partner atApollo Mallageinent, L.P. {""A~ollo""), a multi-billion dollar investment adviser registered withthe Commission. Rashid provided investment advice to at least five private equity fundsmanaged by Apollo affiliates, As ilrvestment advisers, Apollo and Rashid owed fiduciary dutiesCase 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 1 of 28 to the client funds that they advised. At all times, they were required to act in their clients' bestinterests end owed (hose clients a duty of undivided loyalty and utmost good faith.~. During the Relevant Period, Rashid received millions of dollars each year relatedto his advisory ser~~ices as an Apollo partner. Nevertheless, by at least ?010, Rashid beganmisappropriating the private equity funds' money by submitting false expense reports to obtainreimbursement for claimed business expenses Yhat were, in fact, his personal expenses, inviolation of both Rashid's and Apollo's fiduciary duties to these funds.4. Over the Relevant Period, Rashid fraudulently charged more than one thousandpersonal items and services to the private equity funds that he advised. In 2010, for example,Rashid sought over ~ 1,100 in reimbursement from two private equity funds by falsely claimingthat the charbes were for business-related meals. In fact, Rashid sought the $1,100 to cover thecost of his visits to a hair salon. Later in 2010, Apollo discovered that Rashid charged these Šand other Špersonal expenses to the private equity funds that he advised, and required Rashid torepay these expenses. But Apollo took no specific steps to ensure that Rashid did not againmisappropriate their clients' funds.5. Despite Apollo's knowledge of Rashid's unlawful conduct, Rashid continued toimproperly charge person~~l expenses to the private equity fur7ds that he and Apollo advised. .Forexample, he charbeci expenses for several personal vacations to private equity funds that headvised, including intenlational vacations with his family for holidays acid trips to attend hisfriends' weddings.6. Rashid knew that 11is conduct was wrong, and lie took active steps to conceal it.In 2012, for example, after his administrative assistant questioned whether Rashid's $3,500chaz-ge at a high-end men's clothing store was business related, Rashid falsified a receipt toCase 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 2 of 28 justify the expense as business-related holiday gifts for executives of companies in which thefunds invested, when, in fact, Rashid had spent that money on a suit for his father.Apollo discovered Rashid's attempt to charge two of the private equity funds for'~~~, ~-ather's suit before it was charged to the funds, and required Rashid to repay that expense toApollo, along with other personal expenses that Rashid admitted he c}iarged to the funds headvised. Despite Apollo's additional discoveries, Rashid continued to charge thousands ofdollars of his personal expenses to funds he advised.8. After an extensive intenlal investigation into Rashid's expense issues andRashid's repayment of approximately $290,000 in personal expenses Rashid had charged toclients, Apollo entered into a separation agreement with Rashid effective February 2014.VIOLATIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT9.

Apollo has been registered with the Commissioi~7 as an investment adviser since2007. Along with certain of its affiliated advisers, Apollo manages more than .x,46 billion inassets.24. Since being registered as an investment adviser, Apollo has managed multipleprivate equity funds that invest in distressed or undervalued companies with the goal of laterexiting the investments for a profit. The companies in which Apollo's private equity fundsinvest are referred to as ""portfolio companies.""Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 7 of 28 25. During the Relevant Period, Rashid was an investment adviser to Apollo's privateequity funds. At the beginning of the Relevant Period, Rashid was a Partner at Apollo, and by2012, Apollo promoted him to Senior Partner. During the Relevant Period, Rashid was a~:r~ember of the private equity investment group and advised the Relevant Fuilds. Specifically,Rashid sourced, evaluated, and recommended investment opportunities to the Relevant Funds aswell as monitored the perfoi-marlce of investments made by the private equity funds and, whenappropriate, developed and recommended disposition strategies. He regularly participated inweekly meetings that took place amongst the investment professionals in the private equitygroup, where they discussed and determined, anlong other things, potential investments for theprivate equity funds ar~d the disposition of investments in those funds, including the RelevantFunds.2b. As described in a private placement memorandum for ANRP, for example,Apollo stated that Rashid `'leads [Apollo's] efforts in metals and mining and has helped generate,evaluate and execute a majority of [Apollo's] transactions in the sector.""27. Rashid further monitored the Relevant Funds' portfolio companies andimplemented plans to enhance their financial performance. He also conducted due diligence todetermine when and how the Relevant Funds could profitably liquidate or reduce theirŁ ownershipinterests in the portfolio companies they owned. Rashid served as a member of the boards ofdirectors of at least three publicly-traded portfolio companies. Rashid further acted as a principalpoint of contact between these portfolio coinpaliies' executives and the Relevant Funds.28. Rashid received compensation for providing investment advice to the RelevantFunds. He also received director fees for serving on the portfolio companies' boards ofdirectors. In total, Rashid received millions of dollars per year related to his advisory services8Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 8 of 28 with Apollo during the Relevant Period. Rashid hid an interest as a limited partner in the;eneral partlzers of Fund V, Fund VI, Fund VII, and ANRP, as we11 as equity interests in theRelevant Funds.29. As investTnent advisers, Rashid and Apollo had a fundamental obligation to act inthe best interests of their clients, to provide investment advice that was in their clients' bestinterests, and to exercise the utmost good faith in dealing with their clients.II. The Relevant Funds' Governing Documents and Apollo's Policies Prohibited RashidFrom Charging Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds30. The Relevant Funds' govenling documents permitted Apollo and Rashid tocharge expenses to the Relevant Funds only if the expenses related to the funds' investments andoperations. The govel-~1in~ documents dicl not permit Rashid or Apollo to charge personalexpenses to the Relevant Funds.31. Apollo's limited partnership agreement for ANRP, for example, stated that ANRPwas responsible only for operating expenses ""arising in connection with [ANRP's] operationsaild the acquisition, ownership, and maintenance of investments in the Portfolio Companies.""ANRP's limited partnership agreement did not permit Apollo to charge its employees' personalexpenses to the fund.32. Similarly, during the Relevant Period, Apollo's Travel and ExpenseReimbursement Policies and Procedures (""T&E Policies"") permitted its employees to chargetheir clients only with reasonable business and travel expenses incun-ed in the performance oftheir duties. It stated, ""Apollo will reimburse employees for business and travel expensesincurred while performing their duties, provided the expenses are necessary, reasonable andappropriately documented."" It further required employees to ""use best efforts to appropriately9Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 9 of 28 allocate the expensc,~' including using project codes to identify amounts that should be billed toApollo's funds' portfolio companies, investment funds, or other special projects.33. Apollo's T&E Policies fiirther stated that ""[e]thics, integrity, and efficiency arethe cornerstones of success for all professional service companies,"" and that ""[e]very employeewho incurs expenses on behalf of the Company has a fiduciary obligation Š to know, understandand adhere to the Company's Travel &Expense Reimbursement Policies and Procedures."" Itwarned that ""[a]ny attempt to knowingly submit a false claim will be treated as a seriousdisciplinary offense.""34. Apollo's T&E Policies further gave examples of ""Typical Non-ReimbursableT&E Items"" that included ""Barber/Beauty Shop or Spa charges,"" ""Clothing,"" ""Non-Business(e.g. personal) travel and entertainment expenses,"" ""Personal items,"" and ""spousal or othercompanion expenses."" Notwithstanding Apollo's T&E Policies, Rashid charged each of thesespecified, non-reimbursable items to the Relevant Funds.35. In addition, Apollo's Employee Handbook stated that employees maybereimbursed for ""reasonable business expenses at the discretion of the Company,"" and that""[e]x~ensing items that are not business related is a serious offense.""36. During the Relevant Period, Rashid signed annual certifications that he hadcompleted Apollo's compliance training that included training concerning Apollo's T&EPolicies. Rashid also signed Apollo's Code of Ethics, which stated, among other things, that""[t]he falsification of any book, record or account relating to the business of Apollo, its clients orto the disposition of assets of the Firm or its clients (including, without limitltion, t11e submissionof any false personal expense statement, claim for reimbursement of anon-business expense or afalse record or claim uiadcr an employee benefit plan) is prohibited.""10Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 10 of 28 37. Rashid knew, or was reckless in not lalowing, that the Relevant Funds' offeringdocuments, other governing documents, and Apollo's T&E Policies prohibited him fromcharging his personal expenses to the Relevant Funds. Rashid received documents regarding~~ polio's T&E Policies, attended mandatory training regarding such policies and procedures, andconfirmed ghat he understood such policies and procedures as an adviser with Apollo.III. Apollo's Business Expense Reimbursement Process38. Pursuant to Apollo's T&E Policies, Apollo gave employees such as Rashid acorporate credit card to pay for business-related expenses. Apollo's T&E Policies emphasizedthat ""Employees generally should NOT use their [corporate credit card] for personalexpenses.'' It further directed that ""[i]f for some reason you do need to charge a personalexpense on the [corporate credit card] ... ,you are required to remit payment directly"" to thecredit card company.39. To obtain reimbursement for claimed business expenses, Apollo's T&E Policiesrequired employees to submit expense reports each month to address the ""WHO, WHAT,WHEN WHERE and WHY"" of each business expense.40. Apollo's T&E Policies permitted employees to delegate expense reportpreparation to other individuals, such as an assistant, but noted that ""the employee is ultimatelyresponsible for timely and accurate submission of his/her expenses regardless of who preparesthe expense report."" In addition, for at least part of the Relevant Period, before submitting'- ~~~ expensereports; Apollo's T&~ policies required employees to certify that they (1) ""have read,understood and complied with [Apollo's T&E Policies]""; and (2) ""affrm that the reimbursableexpenses included in this expense report are valid business expenses.''11Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 11 of 28 4~1. Pursuant to t~lese policies, Apo110 gave Rashid a corporate credit card to pay forhis business expenses. The corporate credit card com~aany sent Apollo monthly bills containingRashid's charges. Apollo paid Rashid's bill directly, and then sent Rashid draft expense reports~~~>r Rashid to identify who should ultimately be responsible for each of Rashid's expenses and toprovide justifications for all business expenses.42. Apollo required Rashid to personally approve each monthly expense report beforesubmitting it to Apollo's expense manager for review and approval.43. Although Rashid's administrative assistants prepared the initial drafts of hisexpense reports, Rashid approved them and provided supporting details and instructionsconcerning how Apollo should bill the expenses. Rashid often provided verbal explanations tohis assistants when they had questions about particular expenses. He also highlighted andannotated draft expense reports to identify the business purpose and the client or entity thatshould pay for each expense, which his administrative assistants then finalized and submitted toApollo for final disposition in accordance wit1~1 Rashid's instructions.44. At least in 2010, Rashid also submitted affidavits ""to prove the legitimatebusiness purpose"" for claimed business expenses when he did not provide receipts. Even afterApollo no longer required employees to submit these affidavits, Rashid continued to review andapprove his expense reports before IZis assistants submitted them to Apo11o.45. AfterŁ Rashid or his administrative assistants submitted a final expense report to-' Apollo, 'Apollo would a1~~ocate Rashid's expenses to'the individual funds for which each expensetivas related as Rashid had indicated in his expense reports.12Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 12 of 28 46. Rashid knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Relevant Funds would becharged for any expense that he allocated to a Relevant Fund or one of its portfolio companies asa claimed business expense in his monthly expense reports.47. Apollo sent the Relevant Funds periodic (often quarterly) statements setting forth1Łeimbursement for Rashid's (arid other Apollo employees') claimed business expenses. TheRelevant Funds then reimbursed Apollo for Rashid's claimed business expenses via wiretra~lsfers.IV. During the Relevant Period, Rashid Fraudulently Charged Nearly $290,000 of HisPersonal Expenses to the Relevant Funds48. By no later than ?010, Rashid began fraudulently charging personal expenses tothe Relevant Funds in breach of the Relevant Funds' governing documents, Apollo's T&EPolicies, and his and Apollo's fiduciary duties to the Relevant Funds.49. Throughout the Relevant Pez7od, Rashid regularly charged personal expei~7ses tohis corporate credit card and then fraudulently claimed them. as business expenses on his monthlyexpense reports to Apollo. In most cases, Apollo then obtained reimbursement from theRelevant Funds for these expenses based ot~ Rashid's false representations that they werebusiness related.50. During the Relevant Period, Rashid misappropriated approximately X290,000 (ofwhich at least approximately $170,000 post-dated June 13, 20'11) from the Relevant ~'uizds byfalsely claiming that his personal expenses were legitimate business expenses. These expensescomprised hundreds of different charges including charges for personal travel, consumerelectronics and restaurant meals.A. In 2010, Rashid Admitted to Fraudulently Billing Certain Personal Expenses '~13Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 13 of 28 51. During 20'10, Rashid TŁegularly charged expenses related to personal groomingservices that he received at a high-end hair salon to his Apollo corporate credit card. Incompleting his expense reports, Rashid falsely claimed that this hair salon was a restaurant andthat more than X1,100 of expenses were business-related ""meals with management,"" sometimesidentifying specific executives he claimed to have taken to dinner. Based on Rashid's falserepresentations, certain of the Relevant Funds paid for personal hairŁ salon charges that Rashidclaimed were business expenses.52. In or around September 2010, Rashid's administrative assistant becamesuspicious of Rashid's explanations for these recurring expenses. After detez7nining that therewas no restaurant in New York with the name of the vendor on the credit card statement, but thata New York hair salon had that name, she reported her concerns to Apollo's expense manager.The expense manager escalated the matter to Apo11o's Chief Financial Officer (`'CFO""), whodecided to conduct a review of Rashid's expense reports for the previous six months. Uponreview of those expense reports, the expense manager identified a number of other suspiciousentries, such as approximately $5,000 in New York City apartment realtor expenses that Rashidcharged to a Relevant Fund, claiming that they were for ""zŁesearch reports"" relating to the f'und'sinvestments when, in fact, they were Rashid's personal expenses.53. In November 2010, Apollo's CFO confronted Rashid about these questionableexpenses. Rashid admitted that they were his personal expenses, and ultimately agreed to payback almost $8,000 in fraudulently billed personal expenses. Apollo's CFO told Rashid thatbilling personal expenses to the private equity funds was not acceptable and instructed hiin not torepeat the conduct.14Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 14 of 28 54. Despite this incident, Rashid failed to acknowledge to Apollo or any of theRelevant Funds that he had previously billed additional personal expenses to the Relevant Funds.55. For example, Rashid failed to disclose to Apollo or any of the Relevant Funds a~'''~S personal charge at high-end clothing store Ermene~ildo Zegna (""Zegna"") from June 2010,which Rashid charged to a Relevant Fund on his expense report by claiming that it was a ""clientlift.`56. When Apollo management asked Rashid about this charge in September 2U 10,Rashid falsely claimed that it was `'shirts and ties"" for fifteen specific portfolio companyexecutives to celebrate the company's IPO. The named executives, however, did not receiveclothing or any other gifts from Rashid. Rashid had falsely made this claim to obtainreimbursement from a Relevant Fund for his own personal charges.57. Rashid also failed to disclose to Apollo ar any of the Relevant Funds inNovember 2010 that he had charged the following personal expenses to the Relevant Funds asbusiness expenses: over $2,300 in charges at the Apple Store in May 2010 for purported ""IPOgifts,"" an additional $1,265 in charges at Zegna in July 2010 for purported ""office gifts,"" and a$275 charge at Bliss Spa for ""a missed appointment due to [portfolio company] conference callt11at rail over Š no last minute cancellations."" None of these expenses were client bifts, and the$275 charge at Bliss was, in fact, for approximately $75 in services for his sister and anapproximately $200 gift card used for Rashid's personal purposes."" ` ~ B. ""~Rashid~Continued to Charge Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds AfterNovember 201058. Nor did the November 2010 incident deter Rashid from continuing to chargepersonal expenses to the Relevant Funds. Only a month later in December 2010, Rashid emailedan Apo110 coznplialice offacer to request pi-e-approval to give purported 1loladay gifts from Zegna15Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 15 of 28 and the Apple Store to executives of at least two of the Relevant Funds' portfolio companies. Tojustify his request, Rashid provided a list of twenty-six portfolio company executives for whomhe intended to purchase gifts. Based on Rashid's misrepresentations, the Apollo complianceofficer approved Rashid's request.59. A few weeks later, Rashid charged more than $3,800 at Zegna and $800 at theApple Store. He allocated these expenses in his ex~~ense report to certain. of the Relevant Fundsin accordance with the purported business justifications in his email to the Apollo complianceofficer.60. Rashid never gave any gifts to the executives that he identified. Instead, hebought items at these stores for himself and his family members.C. Rashid Fraudulently Charged His Vacation Expenses to the Relevant Funds61. Rashid also billed the Relevant Funds for tens of thousands of dollars in expensesfor family vacations.62. For example, Rashid billed two of the Relevant Funds for about $7,500 in airfareand hotel charges for a vacation Rashid and his wife took to attend a friend's wedding in Hawaiiin 2010. Rashid allocated the couple's five-night stay at the ocean-front Ritz Carlton and rentalcar fees to a portfolio company owned by Fund V, and he separately allocated both his and hiswife's airfare to Hawaii to a portfolio company owned by Fund TIL In his expense reports,Rashid justified charging these Relevant Funds for this personal trip by claiming on his expense~~report~that~it~vasfor`a~""busin~esstrip toDai~as for [portfoliocoinpany] meetings"" and a ""[l~]otelfor [portfolio company] conference.""16Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 16 of 28 63. The justifications Rashid provided were false. This trip was personal and had noconnection to the Relevant Funds' or their portfolio companies. Nor was it to Dallas. Rashidknew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these were false business justifications.64. In addition, Ras~lid charged expenses relating to the following vacations to certainof the Relevant Funds: (1) approximately $7,500 for trips to Cancun, Mexico, with his wife overthe New Year's holidays in 2010 and 2011; (2) over $4,500 for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,with his wife over the New Year's holiday in 2012; (3) approximately $1,400 for trips to bed-and-breakfast hotels nearŁ the New Jersey shore in 2009, 2010, and 2011; (4) approximately$5,000 for a trip to the St. Regis Bal Harbour resort in Florida with his parents and sister over theThanksgiving holiday in 201?; and (5) approximately $4,000 for weekend trips to Las Vegas,Nevada in 2012 and 2U 13.65. All of these trips were personal holiday trips and vacations that were notappropriate client charges, yet, ir1 each instance, Rashid submitted expense reports fraudulentlyclaiming them as business expenses, azld Apollo obtained reimbursement for these expensesfrom the Relevant Funds.D. In 2012, Rashid Made Misrepresentations and Falsified a Receipt to JustifyBilling Additional Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds, and AgainAdmitted to Charging Certain Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds66. In January ?012, Rashid again sought and obtained approval from Apollo'scompliance department to purchase ""holiday gifts"" at Zegna and Bliss Spa for a list of portfolio~co~npanyexecntives: ' I~ this request; Rashid represented that he would ""stay at the limit of $100per person"" and specified t11at he would be purchasing ""Zegna ties for the inen and Bliss giftcards for the Women."" Rashid's pre-approved request specified thirty-eight portfolio companyexecutives to whom lie intended to give holiday gifts.17Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 17 of 28 b7. Following his request, in ~'ebru~ry 2012, Rashid charged X400 at Bliss to hisApollo credit card and allocated the charge to certain of the Relevant Funds as ""Holiday Gifts.""On April 27, 2012, Rashid charged X3,500 at Zegn~ to his Apollo credit card.6b. On the same day that Rashid made the $3,500 charge at Zegna, he forwarded toleis assistant the compliance department's email approving the purchase of thirty-eight corporategifts of ""Zegna ties for the men and Bliss gift cards for the Women."" Thereafter, in May 201?,when Rashid's assistant received the initial draft of Rashid's monthly Apollo credit card charges,she noticed the $3,500 charge at Zegna and asked him if it was personal. Rashid responded thatit was a business expense and should be allocated to certain of the Relevant Funds as holidaygifts. Because Rashid was travelling at the time, his assistant called Zegna to request a receiptin keeping with Apollo's T&E policies.b9. The Zegna store clerk emailed Rashid's assistant a receipt for the ;3,500 chargeon his Apollo credit. card. The receipt showed the charge was for a suit for Rashid's father, riotfor a business expense oi- business gifts as Rashid had claimed.70. Shortly after Rashid's assistant received the Zegna receipt, she received atelephone call from Rashid asking why she called Zegna for a receipt. She explained thatApollo's T&E policies required a vendor receipt. Rashid then told her the $3,500 receipt Zegnahad sent her for his father's suit was the wrong receipt. and that he would obtain the cor~z~ectreceipt.

125,125,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Michael Liberty, the founder of the fintech startup now known as Mozido, Inc., with a fraudulent scheme to trick hundreds of investors into investing in his shell companies instead of Mozido. Michael Liberty and his accomplices then stole most of the more than $48 million raised to fund a lavish lifestyle that included private jet flights, multi-million dollar residences, expensive cars, and movie production ventures.

The SEC's complaint, filed March 30, 2018, alleges that Michael Liberty, his wife, Brittany Liberty, his cousin, Richard Liberty, Paul Hess, and attorney George Marcus induced investors to purchase unregistered interests in shell companies controlled by Michael Liberty that supposedly owned transferrable interests in Mozido. In reality, the shell companies either did not own, or were not permitted to transfer, interests in the company. The SEC also alleges that Michael Liberty and his accomplices lied to investors about Mozido's valuation and finances, the amount Michael Liberty had personally invested in Mozido, and the use of their funds. According to the complaint, Michael Liberty and his accomplices later orchestrated a series of transactions in which they used investors' own money to heavily dilute their interests and duped investors into trading securities for those worth more than 90% less.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Maine, charges Defendants with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Michael Liberty; Brittany Abbass Liberty (""Abbass""); Richard Liberty; Hess; Marcus; Brentwood Financial, LLC (""Brentwood Financial""); BRTMDO Investments, LLC (""BRTMDO""); Family Mobile, LLC (""Family Mobile""); and Mozido Invesco, LLC (""Mozido Invesco"") violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, Marcus, Brentwood Financial, BRTMDO, Family Mobile, and Mozido Invesco aided and abetted those violations. It also alleges that Liberty, Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, Marcus, Brentwood Financial, BRTMDO, Mozido Invesco, Family Mobile, and TL Holdings Group, LLC violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and, in the alternative, Liberty, Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, and Marcus aided and abetted those violations. Finally, the complaint alleges that Hess and Richard Liberty violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Xanadu Partners, LLC has been named as a relief defendant.

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.Michael Liberty (ﬁLibertyﬂ) and his accomplices engaged in a long-running
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 1 of 66    PageID #: 1 2fraudulent scheme using multiple fraudulent securitie
s offerings.  They tricked investors into 
believing that they were funding fast-growing 
startup companies. They werenot.Liberty and his 
accomplices lied to those investors about the financ
ial prospects of the startups, the use of their 
investment dollars, Liberty™s invol
vement with the startups, and 
the nature of the investments 
offered.  Through these lies, Liberty and his accomplices enriched themselvesat the expense of 

boththeinvestors and the startup companies.Thr
ough their scheme, Liberty and his accomplices 
raised more than $55 million from hundreds of in
vestors, misappropriating most of it to fund Liberty™s lifestyle, including chartered flights,
 a dairy cow farm, and the funding of a movie 
production.2.Defendants™fraudulent scheme center
ed onMDO, a financial technology 
company(then known as Mozido LLC), and later 
on Mozido, Inc., which bought all of MDO™s 
assets.Liberty claimed to be th
e founder of MDO and served as a 
de facto
officer of MDO and 
Mozido, Inc.  From 2010 to 2017, Liberty and his as
sociates used shell companies (for example, 
acompany Liberty named ﬁMozido Invescoﬂ) to
 raise money from hundreds of investors, who 
purchased securities in the form of promissory
 notes issued by the shell companieswithout 
active business operations.  Liberty and his associ
ates represented that thesenotes provided a 
vehicle for investment in MDO.
3.To facilitate his frauds, Liberty enlisted his attorney George Marcus and his then-
girlfriend and bookkeeper Brittany Abbass.  He re
cruited his cousin Rick Liberty and Rick™s 
friend Paul Hess to promote and sellthe secur
ities Liberty fraudulently offered.  And he used 
four shell companies to issue securities and one shell company to purchase and distribute 

securitiesas an underwriter.
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 2 of 66    PageID #: 2 34.To sell thepromissory notesissued by his shell companies, Liberty and his 
associates misled investors by falsely representing that:  (1) the investors™money was going to 

MDOto develop its technology and expand its ma
rkets; (2) Liberty™s shell companies owned 
interests in MDOor had the authority to sell them;(3) MDO™s value was high and its financial 

situation was very strong; (4) Liberty had invested tens of millions of dollars of his own money 

into MDO;and (5) Liberty was financially able 
to honor the personal guaranteeshe provided to 
investors along withthe promissory notes.  In 
fact, (1) Liberty took the investors™ money for 
himself; (2) some of his shell companies did not own ownership units in MDO, and others held 
ownership units that they were prohibited from se
lling; (3) MDOstruggled financially, defaulted 
on its debt, and was at times valued at less than 10% of what Liberty and his associates 

representedto investors; (4) Liberty, at the time he was touting his large investment in the 

company, had really invested less than $5 milliono

STATEMENT OF FACTS
I.The Mozido Scheme
A.MDO
27.MDO was a financial technology company 
focused on offering retail and business 
customers a ﬁmobile walletﬂ (a way for customer
s to use their mobile phone to pay for products 
and transfer money).  MDO was started in 2008 as a subsidiary of Affinity Holding,LLC. 
28.Liberty served on MDO™s Board of Directors until February 2011.  Later, he
served as the Chairman of Global Strategic In
itiatives for MDO, and then for Mozido, Inc.At 
various times, Liberty also took other titles, in
cluding Vice-Chairman.These were lucrative 
arrangements for Liberty; he billed MDO hundr
eds of thousands of dollars for travel and 
entertainment expenses he purportedly had 
incurred for MDO™s business purposes.  
29.By 2010, MDO needed cash:  it was not pr
oducing revenue and ha
d lost itslargest 
investor.  30.In August 2010, anew investor, Mobile 
TechInvestments, LLC (ﬁMobile Techﬂ),
invested $2.5 million in MDO, in exchange for a 
15.6% share of the company (based upon a total 
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 9 of 66    PageID #: 9 10valuation of $13.5 million, as approved by MDO™s 
Board of Directors).A portion of MDO™s 
remaining equity was owned by Affinity Holding,
 which in turn was owned by various persons 
and entities including Mozido Investments (a Liberty-controlled shell entity) and BRTMDO.  

Liberty controlled Mozido Investments through his entity BRTMDO.
31.At the time of the investment, MDO executed an ﬁAmended and Restated Limited 
Liability Company Agreementﬂ (ﬁAmended Operating Agreementﬂ).Liberty agreed to MDO™s 

Amended Operating Agreement and personally 
signed on behalf of Mozido Investments, 
BRTMDO, and himself.  Marcus was the lawyer
 who negotiated with MobileTech over the 
amendments to MDO™s Operating Agreement.  
32.As conditions for itsinfusion of capita
l into MDO, the Amended Operating 
Agreement granted Mobile Tech a variety of prot
ections, including preemptive rights (the right 
to acquirenewly issued MDO equity), tag-along ri
ghts (the right to require a purchaser of MDO 
equity to purchase from Mobile Tech at the pur
chaser™s proposed terms) and the right of first 
refusal (the right to acquire MDO equity from a 
seller at the terms proposed by the purchaser).  
33.In particular, the Amended Operating Agreement grantedMobile TechaﬁRight 
of First Offerﬂ in equity interests of Mozi
do Investments and BRTMDO. Under this provision, 
Liberty was required to notifyMobile Techprior to an
y issuance or transfer of equity interests in 
Mozido Investments or BRTMDO.Mobile Tech then had an option to purchase the equity 

interests itself or to require the proposed purch
aser to purchase interests in MDO equities from 
Mobile Tech.The Amended Operating Agreemen
t expressly provided that any transfer or 
issuance that violated these pr
ovisions would be ﬁwholly void.ﬂ
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 10 of 66    PageID #: 10 11B.Liberty Enlists Hess to Market and Sell Securities
34.Concurrent with the MobileTech negotia
tions, Liberty recruited Hess to promote 
MDO and to identify investors.  Hess began workin
g as a self-described ﬁconsultant,ﬂ ﬁstrategic 
advisor,ﬂ or ﬁpartnerﬂ of MDO, promotingMDO 
to potential investors,and maintainingregular 
contact with them.  Liberty directed Hess to tout MDO, but actually had him sell securities 

issued by the shell companies that Liberty controlled.  In exchange, Liberty (through his entities) 

paidHess a5% commission on the money he raised.
35.Prior to December 31, 2010,Hess was a repr
esentative at an investment advisory 
firm.  But all of his selling described in this 
Complaint was done outside his engagement with 
that investment advisory firm, contrary to th
e firm™s policies.After that date, Hess was not 
licensed orworking for a registered broker-dealer.  
36.Hess received a 5% commission from his fundraising.  Hess sent Abbass 
spreadsheets detailing what he had raised and what he was owed.  He also emailed her (e.g., on 

September 9, 2010) to confirm how much money 
hadbeen received from his solicitationsand to 
request payments of his commi
ssion or ﬁreferral bonus.ﬂ  
37.By law, Hess was not permitted to rais
e funds outside the supervision of the 
brokerage with which he was af
filiated (a prohibite
d practice known as ﬁselling awayﬂ).  Nor 
was he permitted to receive commissi
ons or otherwise act as an unr
egistered broker-dealer.  Yet, 
throughout the relevant time 
period, Hess did all of these things:  selling away, receiving 
improper commissions, and acting as 
an unregisteredbroker-dealer.
38.To hide his misconduct and his unlawfu
l receipt of 5% commissions for every 
sale, Hess repeatedly told inve
stors he was not receiving commissions.  For example, on October 
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 11 of 66    PageID #: 11 125, 2010, Hess wrote to potential invest
ors and falsely stated that, ﬁ[t]his is not registered with an 
investment bank or broker-dealer, and there are no
 fees or commission paid.ﬂ  On November 26, 
2010, Hess lied to another potential 
investor, stating, ﬁI receive no commission or comp on any 
money raised (no investment 
bank or broker involved)–ﬂ  
C.The Mozido Invesc
oSecurities Offering
:  August 2010-May 2012
39.The first securities offering in the De
fendants™ fraudulent scheme was the Mozido 
Invescopromissory note offering(ﬁMozido InvescoOfferingﬂ).  The Mozido InvescoOffering 

ran from August 2010 through May 2012, 
and raised appr
oximately $18.2 million.
40.Mozido Invesco was formed on August 26, 2010.  Marcus provided legal 
assistance to form Mozido Invesco. Abbass arranged for the creation of a Mozido Invesco bank 

account into which investors could wire in their 
investments, and told 
Hess to direct investormoney to that account. 
41.On or about August 26, 2010, Liberty caused BRTMDO to transfer 120 Mozido 
Investment membership units to Mozido Invesco. 
 Because Liberty failed to notify Mobile Tech 
in advance of the transfer, the transfer was 
void pursuant to MDO™s operating agreement.  
42.The Mozido Invesco Offering consisted 
of securities that were styled as 
ﬁconvertible promissory notes.ﬂ  By their terms, 
the promissory notes promised 5% interest and 
matured in December 2015.  They included a right 
to convert the note into membership units of Mozido Investments at a price of $55,000 per un
it.  These convertible promissory notes 
constitute securities under federa
l securities law.To entice investors, Liberty personally 
guaranteed the convertible promissory notes offered by Mozido Invesco.
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 12 of 66    PageID #: 12 1343.Marcus drafted the original Mozido I
nvesco promissory notes, note purchase 
agreements, and Liberty™s personal guarantee, wh
ich he knew misrepresente
d material facts and 
made material omissions.44.In a classic bait-and-switch, in seekin
g investors for their fraudulent offering, 
Liberty and Hess touted the merits of investing 
in MDOto potential investors.But they actually 
sold investors promissory notes issued by Liberty™s shell company, Mozido Invesco,even though 

Mozido Invesco was expressly barredfrom selling inte
rests without prior notice to and a lack of 
objectionfrom Mobile Tech, under the terms of th
e Amended Operating Agreement that Liberty 
had signed.
45.In touting the Mozido Invesco Offering, LibertyandHess (with Marcus™ 
assistance) repeatedly lied about and/orc
oncealed critical facts about the investment:
First, they misrepresented the financia
l position and business prospects of MDO, 
representing to potential investors that the MDO was valued at many multiples of 
what they knew the company had valued itself.
Second, they misrepresented what the inve
stment proceeds would be used for, 
repeatedly touting the effect the inves
tments would have on pr
oduct development, 
product launches, and lu
crative business deals.  In fact, Liberty divertedmost of 
the money for his personal use.   
Third, they misrepresented and/or conceal
ed critical facts about the conversion
feature of the promissory notes, including
that anyattempted transfers of interest 
in Mozido Investments were void unde
r the terms of an MDO Operating 
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 13 of 66    PageID #: 13 14Agreement that Liberty had signed.  
Fourth, they misrepresented and concealed cr
itical facts about Liberty™s role in the 
investments and relationship withMDO and the Mozido Invesco investors, 
including that: (a) Liberty™s personal financial guarantee was of limited value 

given that Liberty was struggling financ
ially,and (b) that Liberty™s financial 
interests were not aligned with those of 
the investors and that Liberty was actively 
working to dilute their investments.  
Defendants™ misrepresentations and material
 omissions are detailed further below.  
46.Valuations of MDO:
Hessand Liberty(with Marcus™ assistance)knowingly 
made repeated misrepresentationsand omitted material information to investors and potential 

investors about the valuations of MDO durin
g the Mozido Invesco Offering.  For instance:
a.On September 14, 2010, Hess (with Libe
rty™s and Marcus™ knowledge) told 
prospective investorsthat the ﬁsharesﬂ of
 Mozido Investments were valued at $55 
million and that the ﬁprivate round of money ra
ising (pretty much all by me)ﬂ put the 
value of MDO ﬁcloser to $85 million Œstill very much a bargain–.ﬂ  These 

valuations were fictitious.Both Marcus and Liberty knew that MDO™s Board of 

Directors hadvalued the company at no more than $16 millionat that time.
b.In August 2010, after reviewing MDO™s fi
nancial statements, Hess and Liberty 
agreed not to send them or the numbers to i
nvestors.  They were too negative.  Hess 
told Liberty that he would work to ge
nerate something that looked better and 
ﬁsomewhat ‚official.™ﬂ
c.On November 26, 2010, Hess told investor
s that MDO was ﬁarguably worth a solid 
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 14 of 66    PageID #: 14 15$1bill[ion]+ﬂ and that the inve
stment ﬁopportunity exists for my friends only!ﬂ  This 
statement was baseless; MDO valuations never approached $1 billionin this time 

period.d.Also on November 26, Hess told an investor that MDO ﬁhas no commercial 
debt–and is allowing me to raise capital at a valuation that is substantially lower than 

any measure of true market value would suggest–ﬂ Notso.  MDO, in fact, had 

considerable debt, knew nothingof Hess™s 
solicitation efforts,a
nd was not ﬁallowingﬂ 
him to do anything.
47.Use of Investment Proceeds:
During the Mozido Invesco Offering, Liberty and 
Hess repeatedly misrepresented to investors that 
their money was going to go directly to MDO to 
be used for MDO™s development and deployment 
of new products and to maintain a cash-rich 
balance sheet.  They fraudulently represented th
at these new products would quickly generate 
millions, if not billions, of dollars of revenue.For example: 
a.On October 6, 2010, Hess emailed a potentia
l investor that ﬁMozido Invesco LLC 
was set up specifically – for this special 
final-yard opportunity to help [MDO] over 
the goal line and off the launching pad.ﬂ  
b.Later, Hess (with Liberty™s approval) told an
 investor that ﬁwe do have plenty of cash 
well into the first quarterﬂ and that more wa
s coming.  He then stated that the money 
from the Mozido Invesco Offering ﬁwill enable us to power the Wal-Mart deal 

immediately from day one–.ﬂ  
c.On November 26, 2010, Hess solic
ited another potential inve
stor by telling him that 
the cash was needed by MDO ﬁto kick off several upcoming deployments.""
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 15 of 66    PageID #: 15 16d.On February 14, 2011, Hess falsely told invest
ors, ""[f]olks, we are about to become 
cash-flow positive–ﬂ and that his fundraisi
ng was needed only ﬁso that we have 
plenty of working capital and a flush bala
nce sheet while we are negotiating with 
customers/partners and putting money out for new deployments.""  
e.On July 22, 2011, Hess falsely stated that MDO was raising additional money from 
existing investors to ﬁkeep our coffers loaded with cash.ﬂ
Each of these representations was false, misleading, and omitted necessary material facts.  

MDO™s ﬁcoffersﬂ were not loaded with cash a
nd the money from Mozido Invesco investors was 
not used to fill them.Nor did most of the inve
stor money reach MDO to deploy new products or 
to further new deals with other companies.  
48.In fact, Liberty, Abbass, and Hess pocke
ted the bulk of the money raised from 
investors in the Mozido Invesco Offering, 
approximately 90% of the $18.2 million raised:
a.Abbass and others transferred approx
imately $16 million of the $18.2 raised in 
the Mozido Invesco Offering to the Xana
duPartners bank account (which Liberty 
and Abbass used as theirpersonal 
bank account) to fund Liberty™s other 
businesses; purchaseMozido Invesco(w
ith Liberty and Abbass becoming the 
new Mozido Invesco managers);pay creditors; pay disgorgement Liberty owed to 

the SECfrom the prior 
Keystone case(described below); settle lawsuits and pay 
judgments against him; fund a movie Abba
ss was producing; and, to pay for gas, 
groceries, a dairy cow farm, interior deco
rating, chartered flights, and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in credit card bills.  
(Liberty did not maintain a bank account 
in his own name.  Instead, heused the bank accounts of the companies he 
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 16 of 66    PageID #: 16 17controlled and the client funds (IOLTA) 
account at Marcus™ law firm for his 
personal expenses); and,
b.Liberty and Abbass paid Hess more than $890,000 in commissions, 
approximately 5% of the money Hess ra
ised for the Mozido Invesco Offering.  
49.Authorization to Sell Units:
Liberty and Marcus intentionally concealed that 
both their transfer of 120 Mozido Investments
units to Mozido Invesco and any subsequent 
transfer of those units to the Mozido Inve
sco investors were voi
d under MDO™s Amended 
Operating Agreement. In fact, the Mozido Inve
sco Offering Documentsincluded an express 
false representationthat the transfer was not in vi
olation of any other agreement.  In addition, in 
multiple periods, Mozido Invesco had oversold the number of units it actually held.
50.Liberty™s Alignment with Investors:
Hess and Liberty falsely told potential 
investors that, because they were invested through Liberty™s entity, Mozido Investments, Liberty 

shared their interest in protecting Mozido Investments from dilution(that is, a reduction in 

ownership percentage of the company, a
nd thus, reduction in value).  For example:
a.On September 14, 2010, Hess falsely wrote to
 investors, ﬁMichael would not just 
dilute his own personal holdingsﬂ; ﬁrem
ember MICHAEL LIBERTY, PAUL HESS, 
AND–ARE ALL ALIGNED WITH THE EXACT SAME interests as all of you!!ﬂ 
b.But on January 19, 2011, Liberty formed a new entity, Family Mobile, LLC, to loan 
money to MDO.  Liberty caused Xanadu to
 transfer a relatively small amount of 
money to MDO in the name of Family 
Mobile.  In exchange, Family Mobile
participated in a promissory notewith a righ
t to convert the note into preferred units 
of MDO (at a valuation of $13.5 million, far lo
wer than what Liberty™s investors had 
Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 17 of 66    PageID #: 17 18been told). Later that year,Liberty caused Family Mobile to make additional loans 
to MDO (via Xanadu), becauseMDO still had 
not generated any meaningful revenue.  
Family Mobile™sloans to MDOsignificantly diluted the investments of the Mozido 

Invesco investors.  Worse yet, some of the loan money had originally come from the 

Mozido Invesco investors.  In other word
s, Mozido Invesco investors were diluted 
with their own money.  
c.On June 16, 2011, Hess (with Liberty™s kno
wledge) told potential investors that

Hess continued to promote Mozido Invesco, offer

that MDO™s actual valuation was 10% of what they were paying.

127,127,"The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged the pastor of one of the largest Protestant churches in the country and a self-described financial planner in a scheme to defraud elderly investors by selling them interests in defunct, pre-Revolutionary Chinese bonds.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, Kirbyjon Caldwell, Senior Pastor at Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, and Gregory Alan Smith, a self-described financial planner who FINRA has barred from the broker-dealer business since 2010, targeted vulnerable and elderly investors with false assurances that the bonds-collectible memorabilia with no meaningful investment value-were worth millions of dollars. Caldwell and Smith raised at least $3.4 million from 29 mostly elderly investors, some of whom liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme. Caldwell and Smith are alleged to have taken approximately $1.8 million of investor funds to pay for personal expenses, including mortgage payments in the case of Caldwell and luxury automobiles in the case of Smith. Offshore individuals received most of the remaining funds.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Caldwell and Smith violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Smith violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Caldwell and Smith, and an officer and director bar against Caldwell.

In a separate complaint the SEC charged attorney Shae Yatta Harper of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting Caldwell's and Smith's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.. Harper agreed to settle the SEC's complaint against her without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. Among other things, Harper agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty and to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission's Rules of Practice that suspends her from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the Commission with the right to request that the Commission consider her reinstatement after five years.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jacqueline M. O'Reilly and Andre J. Zamorano, with assistance from Allen J. Genaldi, and supervised by Thierry Olivier Desmet in the SEC's Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Wilfredo Fernandez.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF WESTERN LOUISIANA SHREVEPORT DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, CASE NO. Plaintiff, VERSUS KIRBY JON HINES CALDWELL and GREGORY ALAN SMITH, Defendants, JUDGE MAGISTRATE JUDGE COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") alleges as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Kirbyjon Hines Caldwell (""Caldwell"") and Gregory Alan Smith (""Smith"") ( collectively ""Defendants"") from further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by offering and selling participation rights in certain historical Chinese bonds (the ""bonds"") to mostly vulnerable and elderly investors, some of whom liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme. 2. Between approximately April 2013 and August 2014, Defendants raised at least $3,488,500 through a scheme to defraud approximately 29 investors through the fraudulent offer and sale of the bonds. Among other material misrepresentations and omissions, Defendants falsely represented to these investors that the bonds were safe, risk-free, worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, and could be sold to third parties. In reality, the bonds were mere collectible memorabilia with no investment value. Both Caldwell and Smith exerted Case 5:18-cv-00434 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 1 of 15 PageID #: 1 
 control and influence over the scheme, and offered credibility to the investment by, respectively, being a well-known pastor and claiming to be an investment adviser. 3. Through their conduct, Caldwell and Smith violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and l 7(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e( c), and 77q(a)], and Section IO(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule l0b-5 thereunder, [17 C.F.R. § 240.l0b-5]. Further, Smith violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2)]. Unless the Court enjoins the Defendants, they are reasonably likely to continue to violate these provisions of the federal securities laws. DEFENDANTS 4. Caldwell, age 64, is a resident of Houston, Texas. During the relevant period, Caldwell was the Senior 
Pastor at Windsor Village United Methodist Church (the ""church""), one of the largest Protestant churches in the U.S. In the past, Caldwell has been a board member of various public companies, and he currently serves on the board of a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Caldwell also acted as a director to a mutual fund complex during the relevant time period. He and his wife are the co-owners of LDT, LLC (""LDT""), a Wyoming limited liability company which received and held investor funds. 5. Smith, age 55, is a resident of Shreveport, Louisiana. Between December 1999 and July 2010, Smith was associated with a registered broker-dealer. In July 2010, Smith was permanently barred from association with any FINRA member in any capacity, in part for commingling investor funds in his business account and for misappropriating investor funds. 2 Case 5:18-cv-00434 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 2 of 15 PageID #: 2 
 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b ), 20( d)( I), and 22(a) of the Securities Act[l5 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(l), and 77v(a)]; Sections 2l(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78(a)]; and Section 209(d) and 214(a) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(d) and 80b-14(a)]. 7. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in the Western District of Louisiana, because many of the Defendants' acts and transactions constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred in the district. In addition, at all relevant times, Smith and the vast majority of the victims resided in the district. 8. In connection with the conduct alleged in the Complaint, the Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the mails. FACTS A. Background and Mechanics of the Offering 9. From at least April 2013 until August 2014, Caldwell and Smith offered and sold to at least 29 investors participation rights in various historical or Pre-revolutionary Chinese Bonds which Caldwell claimed to own, control, or possess. In some cases, Defendants told investors that their funds would be used to purchase the bonds. Smith, who worked as a financial planner, was responsible for finding investors for this offering. He did so by promising investors exorbitant returns. Smith also represented to many investors that he was an ''investment adviser"" with many years of prior experience assisting 
others with their investments and he advised these individuals concerning whether to invest in this scheme. 3 Case 5:18-cv-00434 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 3 
 10. Smith was instrumental in securing investors for this scheme because he had longstanding ties to prospective investors and operated under the guise of an investment adviser with many years of experience advising clients on similar deals. In one case, Smith promised an investor that she would receive 15 times her original investment within 30 days and any funds she invested would 
be returned within 5 days of any demand for the funds. Smith also falsely told her that he (Smith) had personally invested $250,000 in the deal. 11. Once an investor agreed to invest, Caldwell instructed the investor to wire transfer payment to either a bank account controlled by his attorney or an account in the name of LDT, a Wyoming limited liability company whose only members are Caldwell and his wife. Immediately after the investor sent the money, Caldwell would cause the funds to be transferred to personal accounts of Caldwell, Smith, or a Mexican business associate. B. The Material Misrepresentations and Omissions about the Bonds 1. Background on Pre-Revolutionary Chinese Bonds 12. Prior to the 1949 communist takeover in China, the former republic issued billions of dollars' worth of government bonds. These bonds have been in default since 1939 and the current Chinese government refuses to recognize the debt. 2. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions 13. Smith successfully raised money for this offering by claiming the deal was available to only a few select individuals. Smith falsely told some investors that the money raised would be used to acquire more Chinese bonds. He repeatedly told investors that the bonds were ""risk free,"" ""guaranteed,"" and ""safe"" and that there were buyers lined up to purchase the bonds. Smith also told investors that the bonds would either be sold to a third party or redeemed by the Chinese government. Caldwell also made similar oral misrepresentations to several 4 Case 5:18-cv-00434 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 4 of 15 PageID #: 4 
 investors about the safety of the investment, both before and after they invested. In fact, he even told one investor who invested approximately $800,000 that the bonds were backed by gold or silver. Both Smith and Caldwell told investors that the bonds were valuable and worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars. Neither disclosed that the bonds were in default and no liquid market for the bonds existed. Caldwell and Smith also never told investors they would use investor funds to pay for personal expenses. 14. Although many investors did not understand the investment, they ultimately trusted Smith and took comfort in the fact that a high-profile pastor was offering the investment. Among other things, Smith falsely represented to investors that he too had invested in the bonds and that investors were guaranteed a return on investment which would be paid in less than one year. In one case he promised a return on investment in as little as 30 days. However, Smith failed to tell these investors that these bonds had already matured and had been in default for decades, or that they were not redeemable at all. Smith also failed to disclose that he was receiving compensation for recommending the investment to prospective investors. 3. The Participation Agreements 15. Once Smith found investors for the offering, Caldwell directed his attorney to draft a participation agreement containing the terms of the investment. The participation agreements, many signed by Caldwell, usually included the investment amount, a vague description of the bond, an exorbitant return on investment, a profit-sharing provision, depository bank information, and a ""failure to close"" option pursuant to which the investor could request his or her money back in the event Caldwell was unable to sell the bonds. Many of the participation agreements given to investors generally described the bonds as ""historical Chinese Bonds"" and 5 Case 5:18-cv-00434 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 5 
 several of the agreements specifically identified the bonds as having a date before the Chinese communist revolution in 1949. 16. Under the terms of the participation agreements, the investors' expectation of a return on their investment was based solely upon Caldwell's ability to sell the bonds to a third party purchaser. In fact, many of the participation agreements expressly stated that Caldwell was in control and possession of the bonds and that he planned to sell the bonds to third party purchasers. All investors invested money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits solely from the efforts of the promoters or third parties. This offering was not registered with the Commission. Specifically, no registration statement was filed or in effect pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to the offering. Furthermore, most of the investors who invested in this scheme were not accredited and no exemption from registration was available. In fact, many were unsophisticated retirees who liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme pursuant to Smith's advice. 4. Lulling Emails and Texts 17. Throughout 2014, Caldwell and Smith continued to send emails and texts promising investors that they would be paid. These lulling emails usually provided elaborate explanations for why Caldwell had been 
unable to sell the bonds. Excuses ranged from issues pertaining to international currency exchanges to failures of international organizations like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank to approve the redemptions. Although these excuses sounded plausible to some investors, they had no basis in fact. 18. In some emails Defendants promised that an alleged prospective buyer was interested in purchasing or redeeming the bonds, and that the deal would close within a short period of time. However, none of these deals ever transpired. 6 Case 5:18-cv-00434 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 6 
 19. Caldwell also held frequent investor calls to explain the reasons for the delays. Smith and purported foreign intermediaries participated in these calls to provide further insight on the status of the sale of the bonds to third parties. Many investors received lulling emails and text messages from Caldwell or Smith. Some investors spoke directly with Caldwell about the failed deals. He repeatedly told them to remain faithful and that they would receive their money. Caldwell also used religious references in his lulling emails to give investors hope that they would soon be repaid. Finally, Caldwell sometimes used the alias ""Turner Hines"" when communicating with investors. 20. Caldwell and Smith received approximately $760,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, of investor funds. LDT, controlled by Caldwell, also received approximately $1,000,000 of investor funds, approximately $175,000 of which was transferred to Caldwell. Offshore third parties, at least one in Mexico, received most of the remainder of the investor funds. Investor funds were comingled with other funds in Caldwell's and Smith's bank accounts. Caldwell and Smith used these accounts in part to pay for personal expenses, including mortgage payments in the case of Caldwell and luxury automobiles in the case of Smith. No investor to date has ever received any return on his or her investment. The great majority of investors have never even received their principal back.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") alleges as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Shae Yatta Harper (""Harper"") from further violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws and from aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 2. Between approximately April 2013 and August 2014, Kirbyjon Caldwell and Gregory Alan Smith raised at least $3,488,500 through a scheme to defraud approximately 29 investors through the fraudulent offer and sale of participation rights in certain historical Chinese bonds (""the bonds""). Among other material misstatements and omissions, Caldwell and Smith represented to these investors that the bonds were safe, risk-free, worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, and could be sold to third parties. In reality, the bonds were mere collectible memorabilia with no investment value. At Caldwell's direction, Harper drafted participation agreements in the bonds that were sent to investors. Harper also controlled the bank account to which most investors sent their funds to invest in this investment opportunity, and distributed investor funds to Caldwell and Smith at their direction.

Through her conduct as alleged in this Complaint, Harper violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c), and aided and abetted violations of Section l 7(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a), and Section l0(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 1 0b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.1 0b-5. Unless the Court enjoins Harper, she is reasonably likely to continue to violate these provisions of the federal securities laws. DEFENDANT 4. Harper, age 44, is a resident of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey. Harper is an attorney licensed to practice in California, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia. Harper is currently employed as a transactional attorney within the power and gas industry. OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES 5. Caldwell, age 64, is a resident of Houston, Texas. During the relevant period, Caldwell was the Senior Pastor at Windsor Village United Methodist Church (the ""church""), one of the largest Protestant churches in the U.S. He and his wife are the co-owners of LDT, LLC, (""LDT""), a Wyoming limited liability company formed by Harper in April 2013. 6. Smith, age 55, is a resident of Shreveport, Louisiana. Between December 1999 through July 2010, Smith was associated with New England Securities Corp, a registered dealer. In July 2010, Smith was permanently barred from association with any FINRA member in any capacity, in part for commingling investor funds in his business account and for misappropriating investor funds. 2 Case 5:18-cv-00436 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 2 
 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b ), 20( d)( I), and 22(a) of the Securities Act, I 5 U 
.S.C. §§ 77t(b ), 77t( d)(I ), and 77v(a); and Sections 21 ( d) and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa. 8. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant, and venue is proper in the Western District of Louisiana, because many of the Defendant's acts and transactions constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred in the district. 9. In connection with the conduct alleged in the Complaint, the Defendant, by drafting the participation agreements in the bonds that were sent to investors and by distributing the funds as directed by Caldwell and Smith, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the mails. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Background and Mechanics of the Offering 10. From at least April 2013 until August 2014, Caldwell and Smith offered and sold to at least 29 investors participation rights in various historical or Pre-revolutionary Chinese bonds which Caldwell claimed to own, control, or possess. In some cases, Caldwell and Smith told investors that their funds would be used to purchase the bonds. Smith, who worked as a financial planner, was responsible for finding investors for this offering. He raised the money for this offering by promising investors exorbitant returns on their investment. Smith also represented to many investors that he was an ""investment adviser"" 
with many years of prior experience assisting others with their investments. He gave these investors investment advice concerning whether to invest in this scheme. 3 Case 5:18-cv-00436 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 3 
 11 . Smith was instrumental in securing investors for this scheme because he had longstanding ties to prospective investors and operated under the guise of an investment adviser with many years of experience advising clients on similar deals. In one case, Smith promised an investor that she would receive 15 times her original investment within 30 days and any funds she invested would be returned within 5 days of any demand for the funds. Once an investor agreed to invest, the investor was instructed to wire transfer payment to one of two bank accounts: a bank account solely controlled by Harper and titled in the name of her deceased mother (the ""Estate of Alta Harvey Account"") or an account held by LDT. Immediately after 
the investors sent the money, the investment funds were transferred to the personal accounts of Caldwell, Smith, or a Mexican business associate. B. The Material Misrepresentations and Omissions about the Bonds 1. Background on Pre-Revolutionary Chinese Bonds 12. Prior to the 1949 communist takeover in China, 
the former republic issued billions of dollars' worth of government bonds. These bonds have been in default since 1939 and the current Chinese government refuses to recognize the debt. In 1970, the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC) considered a claim to recuperate this debt under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949. On March 18, 1970, the FCSC concluded in Decision No. CN-147 that because the bonds had been in default since 1939 (ten years prior to Chinese Communist assumption of power), the claims did not come under the purview of the Act. In May 2012, the U.S. Treasury issued a fact sheet confirming that it does not hold any pre-1949 Chinese bonds in its foreign exchanges. 2. Misrepresentations and Omissions 4 Case 5:18-cv-00436 Document 1 Filed 03/29/18 Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 4 
 13. Smith was successful in raising money for this offering by promoting the deal as something that he was offering to only a few select individuals. Smith falsely told some of the investors that the money raised would be used to acquire more Chinese bonds. He repeatedly told investors that the bonds were '""risk free,"" ""guaranteed,"" and ""safe"" and that there were buyers lined up to purchase the bonds. Smith also told investors that the bonds would either be sold to a third party or redeemed by the Chinese government. Caldwell also made similar material misrepresentations to several investors, including that the return on investment was guaranteed. In fact, he even told one investor who invested approximately $800,000 that the bonds were backed by gold or silver. Both Smith and Caldwell falsely told investors that the bonds were valuable and worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars. Harper never directly communicated with any investors and therefore did not make any misstatements or omissions to them. 14. Although many investors did not understand the investment, they ultimately trusted Smith and had faith in the fact that a high-profile pastor was offering the investment. Among other things, Smith falsely represented to investors that he too had invested in the bonds and that investors were guaranteed a return on investment which would be repaid in less than one year. In one case he promised a return on investment in as little as 30 days. However, Smith failed to tell these investors that these bonds had already matured and had been in default for decades, or that they were not redeemable at all. Smith also failed to disclose that he was receiving compensation for recommending the investment to prospective investors. 3. The Participation Agreements 15. Once Smith found investors for the offering, Caldwell directed Harper to draft a participation agreement containing the terms of the investment. The participati"
128,128,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a default judgment as to liability has been entered against DaRayl D. Davis, a self-styled ""Financial Coach"" charged in December 2017 with operating an offering and investment advisory fraud.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Davis raised more than $5 million from approximately 30 investors by selling them fictitious financial products described as ""corporate bond notes"" and ""guarantee bonds."" Davis hosted seminars marketed as the ""Smart Money Academy"" and ""The Smart Money Millionaire Experience,"" and used his religious affiliation to gain investors' trust. Investors believed the financial products sold by Davis were legitimate and would preserve and grow their investments. The complaint alleges that the investments were not legitimate and that Davis fabricated documents and made false statements concerning the fictitious financial products. Davis did not invest the money he raised from his clients, but instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, repay prior investors, and further his fraudulent scheme.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Davis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from Davis, as well as disgorgement from relief defendant Affluent Advisory Group, LLC, against which default judgment as to liability also was entered.

At the time it filed its complaint, the SEC requested a temporary restraining order and an order temporarily freezing Davis's assets, both of which were granted the same day. On January 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy J. St. Eve granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, extended the asset freeze pending final judgment in the case, and entered default against Davis. At a hearing on March 26, 2018, Judge St. Eve entered default judgment against Davis as to liability, as well as against relief defendant AAG. Judge St. Eve also held Davis in contempt for violating the asset freeze and scheduled a hearing for May 10, 2018 to determine how to proceed with the remedies phase of the case.

The SEC's investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson, Norman P. Ostrove, and Jacquelyn D. King, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation is being handled by Mark R. Sylvester, Jennifer Chun Barry, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Ostrove, as well as Jonathan S. Polish of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 NATURE OF THE ACTION
  This matter involves fraudulent securities offering

3.Based on representations made by Davis, 
people 
believed that

did not use 
the money he received from the sale of these products to make investments

 FACTS
 I. Davis™s Background
  Starting in
 about 
2000, Davis 
worked
 primarily as an insurance salesman, and 
15.from 2005 to 2008 he 
maintained securities licenses and 
was associated with a dually
-registered 
broker
-dealer
 and investment adviser
.    More recently
, he 
has portrayed himself as 
life coach
 and media personality
, as 
16.well as an investment adviser
.  Davis
 bills 
himself as a ﬁ‚Financial Coach™ who guides people to
 recognize their true wealth and rethink the way they see money and their relationship with it.ﬂ  
  Davis 
has 
held seminars about financial planning marketed as the ﬁSmart Money 
17.Academyﬂ and ﬁThe Smart Money Millionaire Experience.ﬂ  
  In 2009, he self
-publi
shed what he 
has 
claim
ed to be a best
-selling book about 
18.saving for retirement, ﬁEconomic Secrets of The New Retirement Environment.ﬂ  
  Davis represents that he is a Certified Estate Planner 
(CEP) 
and a Registered 
19.Financial Consultant
 (RFC)
.  However, Davis™s CEP registration lapsed in 2009 and his RFC 
registration lapsed in 2011.  
  Since 
at least the mid
-2000s, Davis has been 
a member of
 a large 
religious 
20.institution
 based in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
 Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 4 of 18 PageID #:4 5  Davis 
has 
used F
AC for his 
insurance 
sales business as well as 
in connection with 
21.the
 fraudulent scheme
 described herein
.  FAC filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2017.  
  Davis 
also 
used AAG to perpetrate his fraudulent scheme.  
Although 
AAG™s 22.website 
claims 
that it 
ﬁmanag
es investment portfolios on a fee
-only, discretionary and non
-discretionary basis for individuals, families, businesse
s, institutions and foundations,
ﬂ AAG does 
not 
in reality 
manage 
any 
investment portfolios on behalf of clients. 
 II. Davis Fraudulently
 Obtained
 Over $5 Million By 
Recommending His Clients Invest 
In The Davis Securities
  From at least 2003 to 2017, Davis raised more than $5 million from 
23.approximately 30 
individuals through the 
unregistered 
offer and sale of securities
 that he 
recommended t
o clients as 
favorable
 investments
.    Davis™
s victims live in 
Chicago,
 Illinois; 
Pennsylvania
; California
; and 
the 
24.Washington, D.C. area
.  Davis targeted 
members of the church to which he belonged
 and 
individuals he met through 
church 
members.  
  Davis 
acted 
as an investment adviser
.  He offered such services through FAC and 
25.AAG.  For example, a flyer for FAC provided to a victim advertised ﬁInvestment Advisoryﬂ 
services.  As noted above, AAG claimed to offer advisory services
.  For at least one investor,
 this 
advisory 
relationship was formalized in an 
26.engagement agreement in which
 the investor agreed to 
pay
 Davis
 a fee
 and, in exchange, Davis 
agreed to review of t
he individual™s ﬁcurrent investment portfolio
,ﬂ ﬁ
develo[p] an asset 
management strategy
,ﬂ and
 provide ﬁrecommendations designed to meet [
the investor™s
] stated 
goals and objectives.ﬂ 
  Davis also conducted financial planning workshops
, including the 
ﬁSmart Money 
27.Academy
,ﬂ to recruit investors.
 Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:5 6  The Smart Money Academy™s website claims that the progr
am is accredited 
28.through AdvancED
. However, AdvancED is
 a non
-profit organization that conducts reviews of 
Pre
-K-12 schools and school systems.  
The Smart Money Academy is not, and has never
 been, 
accredited by AdvancED.
 A. Davis 
Recommended 
and Sold Fraudule
nt 
Corporate
 Bond
 Notes
  Since
 at least 2003, Davis 
recommended and 
sold 
securities he characterized as
 29.ﬁCorporate Bond Notes.ﬂ  
  The notes 
guaranteed interest rates of between 7% and 20%, while some offered a 
30.purported ﬁbonusﬂ of another 5% to 8% if the in
vestor held the note to maturity.  
  Although the notes had terms of one year or more, investors 
purportedly 
could 
31.accelerate the payment of the note in full 
at any time.
    Davis told victims that 
FAC would invest the
 money
 obtained from the sale of 
32.these C
orporate 
Bond Notes
 in order to return the contractual interest to 
investors, describing
 the 
notes to investors as ﬁinvestment loan
[s]
 with Financial Assurance Corporation.ﬂ    
  For some, Davis packaged information about the notes with a brochure for 
a wel
l-33.known
 insurance company 
(ﬁCompany Aﬂ)
, reflecting
 that the principal would be invested in or 
through 
this
 reputable company.  Some 
victims
 purchased the notes using money 
obtained by
 surrendering legitimate annuities investments
 because 
Davis assured the
m that 
the returns on the 
notes would offset fees or losses from surrendering the annuities.  
  When one investor attempted to retrieve her money from Davis, he told her that 
34.her principal had been invested in a ﬁbond portfolioﬂ through a company called Dim
ension 
Funds Advisors.  
No such 
bond portfolio or firm exists.  
 Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 6 of 18 PageID #:6 7  Davis lied to this and other investors about the status of their 
Corporate 
Bond 35.Notes 
Šincluding 
blaming his inability to repay the notes on the illiquid nature of the supposed 
ﬁbond portfoli
oﬂ in which the money
 purportedly
 was invested, 
and other false excuses. 
  Davis did not send any of the money he took from investors to Company A
, nor 
36.did he 
invest in any ﬁbond portfolio
,ﬂ or otherwise make investments on their behalf.
  Davis 
took 
the 
mon
ey for his own use.
 B. Davis 
Recommended and 
Sold Fraudulent Guarantee 
Bonds
  Starting in approximately 2012, Davis 
began selling
 a purported ﬁmulti
-year 
37.guarantee bondﬂ or ﬁmulti
-year interest guarantee accountﬂ that promised interest rates of 6% to 
10%, with
 the potential for a supposed 5% to 20% ﬁCash Bonusﬂ for making an initial deposit. 
  Davis used 
different names
 to describe 
the 
various ﬁguarantee bondﬂ investment 
38.products
, but all
 were structured similar
ly to the 
corporate bond
 notes.  Investors chose an initial 
one, two, o
r three year term, with higher guaranteed interest rates
 offered for longer terms.  
  For some
 investors
, Davis represented that their guarantee bond investment was 
39.being made through 
Company A
.  For example, D
avis told one investor that 
Company A 
was 
FAC™s ﬁprimary investment partnerﬂ and that FAC ﬁworks directly with [
Company A
] to place 
investment funds.ﬂ  Davis made similar claims to others.  Although Davis had sold 
Company A™s 
annuit
y products
 in the past, 
these claims were false.  
  Davis created and distributed to investors numerous documents offering purported 
40.investment products that, in reality, did not exist.
  For example, 
Davis had certain investors sign documents indicating they were 
41.investing in an ﬁ
[Company A] 
Capital Preservation Plus® Plan.ﬂ  The investment was 
supposedly ﬁbacked by the financial strength and claims
-paying ability of 
[Company A]
.ﬂ  
This 
was a fictitious product.
 Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 7 of 18 PageID #:7 8  Company A 
has no record of these documents 
and offers no such
 product.
  42.Moreover, the Capital Preservation Plus trademark is not registered to 
Company A
.  It is 
registered to 
Company B, another well
-known insurance provider, which likewise
 has no record 
of any affiliation with Davis, FAC, or AAG.  
  Davis provided other i
nves
tors documents marketing 
the guarantee bond
 43.investment as an ﬁFAC Aggregate Bond Fundﬂ that he claimed was an ﬁ
[Company A] 
Preferred 
Partners Offering.ﬂ  
Similarly, he created an
 account summary marketing a supposed ﬁCapital 
Preservation Plus®ﬂ account
, wh
ich
 represented that investors™ principal was guaranteed, while 
also offering ﬁguaranteed growthﬂ and ﬁthe flexibility of access to your funds.ﬂ  This document 
touted that the investment had ﬁstock market type returns without the risks associated with 
down
turns in the financial markets.ﬂ  
Again, this was a fictitious product.
  Other documents
 Davis used to induce investors to purchase the investment 
44.products he recommended
 refer to a ﬁFAC Capital Preservation Plus® Planﬂ being offered 
ﬁexclusively for FAC Pr
eferred
Ž distribution partners.ﬂ  Similar to the supposed 
Company A 
investment, the FAC investments were purportedly ﬁbacked by the financial strength and claims
-paying ability of Financial Assurance Corporation.ﬂ  
Similarly, this product did not exist.
  In short, Dav
is 
fabricated
 fake investment products
 and documents
 using the 
45.names of actual entities
 to create the appearance of legitimacy so he could misappropriate 
investors™ money.
 C. Davis Misappropriated
 Investors™ Money 
for 
his 
Own
 Use
  Investors paid for 
the Davis Securities
 primarily by means of person
al checks 
46.payable to FAC or AAG, or wires to
 FAC or AAG
 accounts
.      Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:8 9  Davis deposited all of the money he received from the sale of the Davis Securities 
47.into either FAC™s or AAG™s bank ac
counts, which Davis solely controlled, where it 
remained
 until he spent it.  
  Davis controlled 
all
 FAC and AAG 
bank accounts.  He transferred money 
48.between the accounts and between entities 
at will
.  For example, in 
November 2016, Davis 
deposited into an A
AG account more than $388,000 
received 
from two investors.  Within a few 
days, he transferred $25,000 to an FAC account and used the money to repay other investors.
  Davis did not segregate investors™ money, set up separate accounts, or acquire any 
49.actual i
nvestment products.  Despite selling investors purported 
Company A
 products, he sent no 
money to 
Company A
.    Rather than 
recommending to his clients investment products that would 
preserve 
50.and grow 
their
 money as he represented, Davis 
recommended they inv
est in fabricated securities 
to 
obtain money to 
perpetuate his extravag
ant lifestyle and finance his scheme.
  Davis used about $1 million to 
repay investors who received 
partial 
payments on 
51.their 
corporate 
bond notes or who had requested disbursements from 
their
 purported
 ﬁaccounts.ﬂ  
  Davis spent the remainder of the money
 supporting his fraudulent scheme and on 
52.personal expenses.  
  For example, 
Davis rented offices and furniture for FAC and paid for utilities and 
53.web hosting services.  
Davis 
also used inve
stors™ money to rent office space and maintain a

This
 appearance of legitimacy helped Davis market and sell the 
Davis 
Securities

paying for 
Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:9 10 Davis™s participation in a small
-business expo.  Likewise, Davis spent 
investors™ money 
on internet marketing and personal development programs.  
  Davis also spent 
nearly $500,000 
of investors™ money 
renting 
a mansion in the 
55.Hollywood Hills
Ša house previously rented by various celebrities.
  In addition, 
Davis used 
investors™ money to, among other things, rent a house in Maryland, rent numerous high
-end 
sports cars, join a 
luxury sporting club, 
and visit 
night
 clubs.  Additionally, Davis used 
approximately $700,000 to pay 
his personal 
credit card bills
.  In all, Davis has spent nearly all of the money he
 obtained from his sales of 
the 
56.Davis Securities.
   D. Davis 
Created 
and Sent Investors Misleading 
Account
 Statements
  In order to perpetuate the
 fraud, Davis mailed or emailed several 
of his investors 
57.materially 
misleading account statements.
  Regardless of the purported structure of an investment, Davis provided statements 
58.using the same basic format.  The state
ments indicate that the investor
s had put their money in a 
ﬁCapital Preservation Plus®ﬂ account, each with a unique ﬁContract Number.ﬂ  The statements 
show the amount of the principal investment and the supposed value of the account at the end of 
the relev
ant period based on the contractual interest rate and applicable bonuses.  Some 
statements provide a purported projection of the account™s value for subsequent years.  
  However, there were no ﬁCapital Preservation Plus®ﬂ accounts and the Contract 
59.Number
s are not 
associated with 
any separately held account with any outside entity.
   The account statements also falsely portrayed the economic reality of the 
60.investments.  
Davis 
had
 not, as the account statements suggested,
 preserve
d investors™
 capital
, nor did he 
have the ability to repay investors at the contractual interest rates 
shown because, 
instead of investing, 
he spent investors™ money.  
 Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 10 of 18 PageID #:10 11  The statements misled investors by giving them a false sense of security that their 
61.money was safe and
 ther
eby
 helped Davis perpetuate his scheme.  
  Several individuals made additional investments
 with Davis
 after receiving these 
62.fraudulent documents.
 E. The Extent of Davis™s Scheme
  Davis™s scheme ensnared 
approximately 30 
investors who made at least $5 
63.million of known investments.  
Of that amount, 
Davis repaid approximately $1 million to earl
ier
 investors.  Based on known principal investment amounts, individuals have lost 
at least
 $4 million of principal, after taking int
o account partial 
payments Davis made to some investors
.    Davis™s scheme has continued to the present, with Davis obtaining
 approximately 
64.$150,000 from investors
 in the last three months
, a portion of which he used to repay prior 
investors.
 III. Davis
 Violated
 the Securities Laws
  The 
corporate bond
 notes 
and 
guarantee bonds 
Davis
 recommended,
 offered
, and 
65.sold to investors are securities within the meaning of the 
Securities Act and Exchange Act.
    Davis sold the 
Davis Securities as investments
 and the purchaser
s of these 
66.instruments invested with the expectation of profit.  
  Davis sold the 
Davis Securities 
to individual members of the general public, not 
67.to commercial investors, and these instruments are not subject to a regulatory scheme that 
significantly redu
ced the risks inherent in their purchase.
  Davis
 engaged in the conduct described herein, including the sales and offers to 
68.sell 
the 
Davis Securities
, by use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication 
in interstate commerce, the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and/or by use of the mails.

made material untrue statements and omitted to state material fact

ther to purchase the 
Davis Securities
.  The untrue statements and omissions to state a material fact necessary in order to 
71.make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading described herein were made in conne
ction with and in the offer, purchase, or sale of 
securities.
  In connection with the conduct described herein, 
Davis
 acted knowingly and
 72.recklessly.  
Davis 
knew or 
was 
reckless
 in not knowing 
that 
he was 
making material 
misrepresentations and omitting to s
tate material facts necessary to make certain statements not 
misleading under the circumstances.
    Davis was 
the maker
 of the false and misleading statements
 because 
he 
made the 
73.misstatements directly to investors.  
To the extent any statements were 
made
 by FAC or AAG, 
Davis
 also made these statements because he
 owned and controlled all aspects of 
the operation of 
FAC and AAG.
   Davis
 obtained money or property from investors through 
his
 material untrue 
74.statements and omissions to state a material fact neces
sary in order to make the statements made, 
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   
Davis
 obtained 
more 
Case: 1:17-cv-09224 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/22/17 Page 12 of 18 PageID #:12 13 than 
$5 million in principal investments from investors, which includes 
more than 
$4 million
 in 
principal investments
 lost by investors due to 
Davis™s 
fraud.
  Davis 
used devi
ces, schemes, and artifices to defraud investors, and engaged in 
75.acts, transactions, practices, or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon 
investors.  
In addition to the numerous m
isrepresentations discussed herein, 
Davis created fake 
investment products that he sold to investors, created and distributed to prospective investors 
offering materials advertising these fake investment products, and set up an infrastructure 
intended to d
eceive investors that included two separate companies and the Smart Money 
Academy.  Furthermore, after obtaining investors™ money, Davis fabricated and distributed 
misleading account statements showing fake account balances.  
  Davis acted as an investment 
adviser during the relevant period by 
engaging in 
76.the business of providing
 investment advisory services to individual clients for compensation, 
including but not limited to the money he misappropriated from the sale of the 
Davis Securities
 in which he recommended his clients invest
.  By engaging in the conduct described herein, Davis breached the fiduciary duty 
77.he owed to his investment advisory clients.
  AAG received funds procured through Davis™s material misrepresentations and 
78.omissions 
in connection with his recommendation, offer, and sale of 
the Davis Securities
 over 
which AAG has no legitimate claim.
    AAG obtained these profits above as part, and in furtherance of, the securities law 
79.violations alleged herein.  Therefore, AAG has been u
njustly enriched.

129,129,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Akorn, Inc., a Lake Forest, Illinois pharmaceutical company, its former CFO, Timothy Dick, and its former Controller, David Hebeda, based on financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls violations by Akorn (specifically violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder). Akorn, Dick and Hebeda agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.

According to the Commission's complaint, in May 2016, Akorn restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2014 acknowledging material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related, in relevant part, to controls surrounding the company's gross-to-net reserve accounts and estimates. In its restatement, the company also disclosed that it overstated net revenue for 2014 by approximately 7 percent and income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2014 by approximately 136 percent. Akorn's material weaknesses persisted over multiple reporting periods and contributed to Akorn's materially inaccurate 2014 financial statements.

The complaint also alleges that in 2014, Dick, as CFO, and Hebeda, as Controller, had supervisory responsibilities for Akorn's internal accounting controls, gross-to-net revenue accounting and revenue recognition, and exercised control over these company functions. The Commission's complaint charges Dick and Hebeda with control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for Akorn's violations.

Akorn consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Dick and Hebeda consented to the entry of orders: (a) permanently enjoining each of them from controlling any person liable for violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Exchange Act; and (b) imposing a $20,000 civil penalty against each of them.

The investigation was conducted by Michael Mueller and Timothy Tatman.","   1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

, AND DAVID 
HEBEDA
    Defendant
s.     COMPLAINT
 Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges as 
follows:
 NATURE OF THE ACTION
 1. This is a case of financial reporting, books and records, and internal 
accounting 
controls 
violations by Akorn
, Inc. (ﬁAkornﬂ)
. In May 2016, Akorn restated its financial statements 
for fiscal year 2014
. Its restatement, among other things, 
acknowledged 
material weaknesses in its 
internal control over financial reporting (ﬁICFRﬂ)
 and disclosed th
at previously reported net revenue 
for 2014 was overstated by approximately 7 percent and previously reported income from 
continuing operations before income taxes for 2014 was overstated by approximately 136 percent
. Akorn™s 
inaccurate
 2014 financial statements resulted from various errors in Akorn™s accrual of 
rebates and other contractual allowances using a process known as ﬁgross
-to-netﬂ revenue 
accounting as well as its 
recognition of $2.9 million in revenue for a portion of a trans
action with 
one of its wholesaler customers despite a lack of 
a basis 
on which to properly recognize such 
revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (ﬁGAAPﬂ).
 Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 1 of 18 PageID #:1   2 2. In its 2013 Form 10
-K, filed on March 14, 2014, Akorn disclosed that 
it did not 
have 
sufficient 
controls designed to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data 
used in the determination of significant estimates and accounting transactions, and that, as a 
result, errors were identified in the underlying data u
sed to support significant estimates and 
accounting transactions, primarily relating 
to gross
-to-net revenue adjustments
, inventory 
reserves and the determination of useful lives of acquired intangible assets. Akorn further 
disclosed that it did not have a
n adequate process in place to support the accurate and timely 
reporting of its financial results and disclosures in its Form 10
-K. Akorn had previously 
disclosed in its 2012 Form 10
-K, filed on March 1, 2013, that it did not maintain 
sufficient 
effective 
controls to provide reasonable assurance that accounts were complete and accurate and 
agreed to detailed support. The risks associated with these unremediated material weaknesses 
became 
magnified 
during 2014 as a result of 
Akorn™s decisions to undertake si
gnificant 
acquisitions, as well as 
changes to the nature of Akorn™s business.
 3. Timothy 
Dick
 (ﬁDickﬂ)
, as Chief Financial Officer (ﬁCFOﬂ) at Akorn, 
and 
David 
Hebeda
 (ﬁHebedaﬂ)
, as Controller at Akorn,
 had supervisory responsibilities for Akorn™s 
internal 
accounting controls
, gross

control over these 
company functions.

 FACTS
 Background
 11. During the relevant period, Akorn™s policies required it to recognize revenue and 
liabilities in accordance with GAAP.
 12. Akorn sold its products through multiple distribution channels. Among other 
things, Akorn sold its products to pharmac
eutical wholesalers, which then resold the products to 
downstream retailers (such as pharmacies), and it also sold products directly to retailers. Akorn 
negotiated contractual prices with both wholesalers and retailers. These resulted in rebates and 
contra
ctual allowances owed by Akorn to both wholesalers and retailers that needed to be 
recognized as reductions to revenue. 
See
 Accounting Standards Codification (ﬁASCﬂ) 605
-50-45-2. 13. Wholesaler chargebacks occur when a wholesale customer of Akorn sells to 
a retailer with a negotiated product price lower than the wholesale acquisition cost (ﬁWACﬂ). The 
wholesaler then recovers the price difference from Akorn. A retailer billback occurs when a 
retailer has negotiated a price directly with Akorn but purchases 
goods from a wholesaler at a 
higher price. The retailer then bills Akorn for the price difference. The chart below depicts how 
both chargebacks and billbacks occur in a typical 
pharmaceutical 
sales transaction involving a 
wholesaler
, compared to a 
hypothet
ical 
direct sale to a retailer
. Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 4 of 18 PageID #:4   5  14. Akorn estimated and accrued amounts to cover chargebacks and billbacks
. This 
process 
is commonly referred to in the 
pharmaceutical 
industry 
as ﬁgross
-to-netﬂ accounting
, and 
involve
s recording the gross revenue from product sales and establishing accruals for anticipated 
future chargebacks, billbacks and other forms of rebates associated with those sales. Akorn 
estimated its wholesaler chargeback liability at period
-end based on the a
mount of inventory held 
by its wholesalers and historical experience with regard to how much of that inventory was 
typically sold through to retailers at below
-WAC prices. Akorn 
accrued for 
retailer billbacks at 
period
-end based upon 
actual 
invoices receiv
ed from retail customers
 and estimates derived from 
sales data
 during that period. Dick and Hebeda oversaw the gross
-to-net accounting process and 
approved the relevant gross
-to-net adjustments in connection with the financial close for each 
quarter.
 15. The financial close for each quarter was completed during the month after the 
end
 of each quarter. After the quarterly financial close was completed, Dick and Hebeda presented 
final quarterly financial results to Akorn™s CEO, COO and others in management.
 Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:5   6 16. Akorn™s 
chargeback, billback, and other rebate liabilities increased significantly 
in 2014 
due to a number of events. First, Akorn acquired Hi
-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. (ﬁHi
-Techﬂ), a publicly
-traded specialty pharmaceutical company
 roughly equal in size
 to Akorn 
which
 developed, manufactured and marketed generic and branded prescription and over
-the
-counter drug products. This acquisition
, along with others in 2014,
 significantly increased 
Akorn™s retail business and the volume and amount of billbacks du
e to retailers
 and further 
complicated and strained Akorn™s accounting processes and systems
. Second, a number of 
Akorn™s products experienced dramatic 
market
-wide 
increases in WAC, which resulted in 
significant additional chargeback, billback and other re
bate liabilities. Finally, Akorn™s retail and 
wholesale customers formed ﬁalliances,ﬂ which resulted in changes to those customers™ 
contractual prices and their entitlements to rebates and contractual allowances.

 and Hebeda
, as Controller,
 had supervisory responsibilities for
 Œ and control over 
Œ the policies related to and 
finance 
department 
staff involved in 
devising and maintaining a system of 
internal accounting controls
 at 
Akorn
. Through their supervisory responsibilities and control, Dick and Hebeda had the power 
and ability to devise and maintain internal accounting controls
 sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance, among other things, tha
t transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in conformity with 
GAAP. 18. From 2013 to 2015, Akorn™s management identified and publicly disclosed 
recurring material weaknesses in the company™s ICFR. In relevant par
t, Akorn disclosed the 
following material weaknesses in its 2013 Form 10
-K, filed on March 14, 2014, which related to 
its controls surrounding its gross
-to-net reserve accounts:
 Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 6 of 18 PageID #:6   7 We did not have controls designed to validate the completeness 
and accuracy of
 underlying data used in the determination of 
significant estimates and accounting transactions. As a result, 
errors were identified in the underlying data used to support 
significant estimates and accounting transactions, primarily 
relating to gross to ne
t revenue adjustments, inventory reserves and 
the determination of useful lives of acquired intangible assets.
  We did not have an adequate process in place to support the 
accurate and timely reporting of our financial results and 
disclosures in our Form 1
0-K. Akorn had previously disclosed in its 2012 Form 10
-K, filed on March 1, 2013, that it did not 
maintain 
sufficient 
effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that accounts were 
complete and accurate and agreed to detailed support.
 19. In respon
se to 
these material weaknesses, 
on multiple occasions following the 
release of Akorn™s 2013 Form 10
-K in March 2014, 
Akorn™s Board of Directors
 and its CEO
 emphasized 
to Dick and Hebeda 
the importance of enhancing 
Akorn™s
 ICFR
. 20. In 2014, 
under the supe
rvision of Dick and Hebeda, 
Akorn
™s finance department
 attempted to 
design and implement enhanced controls 
by developing predominantly manual 
procedures for calculating various rebate and contractual allowance reserves
 (the ﬁRemediation 
Planﬂ).
 These contr
ols included 
verifying the completeness and accuracy of underlying data 
pulled from multiple systems
, documenting instructions for journal entries
, and preparing gross
-to-net narrative documentation and flow charts
. The Audit Committee signed off on the ge
neral 
framework for the Remediation Plan.
 Dick and Hebeda supervised the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Remediation Plan
 as a whole
. Implementation of the Remediation Plan 
and the performance of individual enhanced control procedures also involved other 
members of 
the finance department
 supervised by Dick and Hebeda
. 21. The new procedures contemplated by the Remediation Plan did not 
sufficiently 
improve Akorn™s control processes 
by the end of 2014.
 During the year
-end audit, Akorn™s 
Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 7 of 18 PageID #:7   8 outside auditors obse
rved that controls were not designed to 
validate
 the completeness and 
accuracy of underlying data and continued to find errors in the calculation of various rebate and 
contractual allowance reserves, without any compensating controls that would mitigate th
e severity of the errors.
  22. The challenges of 
designing and implementing enhanced controls 
were 
compounded by Akorn™s efforts to integrate the accounting for the sales of Hi
-Tech™s products 
into Akorn™s accounting platform. 
Certain 
finance department employees, who were 
also 
responsible for 
implementing the Remediation Plan
 and performing enhanced control 
procedures
, were tasked
 by Dick and Hebeda
 with planning and implementing the integration of 
the Hi
-Tech products. Akorn missed 
two internally
-set deadlines to fully integrate Hi
-Tech
, but 
ultimately elected to partially transfer a subset of Hi
-Tech™s products onto Akorn™s accounting 
platform in 
mid-November 2014
. The transfer of a subset of Hi
-Tech products onto Akorn™s 
accounting p
latform in the middle of the fourth quarter of 2014 increased the risks associated 
with Akorn™s process for calculating its various rebate and other contractual allowance reserve 
accounts.
 23. Although Akorn hired new 
internal audit and 
finance department 
employees 
(including a Director of Financial Reporting)
 in 2014
, Akorn 
did not increase the size, scope, and 
skills of 
its finance department in a manner that was sufficient to address the significant changes 
to Akorn™s business and accounting processes discussed in paragraphs 1
6. and 
22. above.
 During 
2014, Akorn also 
did 
not 
seek to 
employ 
outside consultants with experienc
e advising companies 
on improving 
ICFR 
systems and processes
. 24. In 2014, 
Dick and Hebeda 
oversaw 
Akorn 
finance department 
personnel 
involved 
in devising and maintaining a system of 
internal accounting controls
. In that time period, 
Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:8   9 Akorn™s system of inte
rnal accounting controls 
was not 
sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance, among other things, that transactions 
were
 recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 
Akorn™s 
insufficient
 internal 
accounting 
controls
 contributed to Akorn™s materially inaccurate 2014 financial statements.
  Akorn™s Materially Inaccurate 2014 Financial Statements and Restatement
 25. At all times relevant to this complaint, Dick
, as CFO,
 and Hebeda
, as Controller,
 had supervisory responsibilities for
 Œ and control over 
Œ the policies related to and 
finance 
department 
staff involved in t
he making and keeping of books and records at Akorn that 
accurately reflected in reasonable detail the transacti
ons and
 disposition
 of assets of Akorn.
 26. During the evening of April 9, 2015, while reviewing Akorn™s first quarter 
financial statements for 2015, Akorn management 
discovered that the rebate reserve for the first 
quarter of 2015 was significantly understated. 
Subsequent t
o April 9, 2015, 
Akorn 
management 
reviewed the financial results for 2014 and found a
dditional 
errors. As a result, on April 24, 
2015, Akorn filed a Form 8
-K with the Commission announcing that Akorn™s Audit Committee, 
upon the recommendation of management
, had concluded that the 
previously
-issued 
financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2014
 (originally filed on March 17, 2015)
, and the 
previously issued unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 
September 30, 2014
 (originally filed on August 11, 2014 and November 10, 2014, respectively)
, should not be relied upon because of errors in the financial statements in those associated 
periods.
 27. On May 10, 2016, Akorn completed its 2014 financial statement restatement 
which identified material accounting errors primarily associated with rebates and contractual 
allowances for 2014. Net revenue for 2014 as previously reported of $593 million was overstated 
Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:9   10 by $38 million and was restated to be $555 million. Income from cont
inuing operations before 
income taxes for 2014 as previously reported of $59 million was overstated by $34 million and 
was restated to be $25 million. Akorn™s 2016 restatement generally disclosed three types of 
errors: failure to accrue for embedded 
retail
er 
billbacks, 
underaccrual 
for certain revenue 
deductions, and 
the incorrect 
recognition of $2.9 million in revenue for a portion of a transaction 
with one of its wholesale customers.
 Dick and Hebeda 
oversaw 
Akorn 
finance department 
personnel
 involved
 in 
the 
mak
ing
 and keep
ing
 of 
books and records that 
did not 
accurately 
reflect in reasonable detail the transactions described below.
 Failure to Accrue for Embedded 
Retailer 
Billbacks
 28. Akorn understated a portion of its rebate reserve estimate related to 
inventory in 
the wholesale channel that was ultimately sold to retailers and subject to billbacks, also known as 
embedded billbacks.
 29. This understatement occurred because Akorn 
did not identify all gross
-to-net 
adjustments resulting from 
the growth and 
changes in its business, including those that would be 
payable to retail customers. Akorn accrued for billbacks 
using a combination of invoices 
received 
from retailer
s and estimates based on sales data where invoices had not been received. 
Historically, 
Akorn™s 
products were not 
typically 
sold through
 the wholesale channel
 to retailers. 
However, this changed in 2014 when the Hi
-Tech acquisition and alliances formed between 
several large wholesalers and certain retail customers resulted in increased Akorn sa
les through 
the wholesale channel to retailers, which significantly increased the amount of billbacks. Further, 
signific
ant price increases on certain Akorn 
products
, particularly the former Hi
-Tech product 
Clobetasol,
 markedly 
increased the dollar amount 
of retailer billbacks relating to sales in the 
third and fourth quarter of 2014.
 Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 10 of 18 PageID #:10   11 30. This error was the single largest component of the 2016 restatement, resulting in a 
reduction of net revenue of $1.4 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2014,
 $8.1 million and $9.5 million in the three and nine month period
s ended September 30, 2014, 
respectively, and $1.0 million and $10.5 million in the three and twelve month period
s ended 
December 31, 2014, respectively.
 Underaccrual 
for Certain Revenue Dedu
ctions
 31. Akorn identified at least nine errors in its estimates related to certain revenue 
deductions, namely rebates, billbacks, failure to supply, price protection penalties and other 
contractual adjustments. The information necessary to record the res
erves for these items was 
generally known or 
estimable 
as of Akorn™s financial statement dates. For example, Akorn 
did 
not 
accrue approximately $3 million of billbacks 
Œ relating to October and November 2014 sales 
to one of its larger retail customers (ﬁRe
tailer Aﬂ) 
Œ in the fourth quarter of 2014, even though 
Akorn received the relevant billback invoices from Retailer A on or around November 25, 2014.
 32. These errors occurred because of deficiencies in Akorn™s system of identifying
 and/or estimating
 reven
ue deductions to accrue at period
-end, including flaws in the 
completeness and accuracy of data used to calculate accruals, exacerbated by the partial 
integration of Hi
-Tech in the fourth quarter of 2014, and an overreliance on a manual process 
stretched t
hin because of resource challenges. These deficiencies were compounded by 
communication failures across Akorn™s contracts, business development, accounts re
ceivable and 
accounting groups.
 33. These errors resulted in a reduction of net revenue of $1.7 mill
ion in the three 
month period ended June 30, 2014, $2.9 million and $4.6 million in the three and nine month 
Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 11 of 18 PageID #:11   12 period
s ended September 30, 2014, respectively, and $16.5 million and $21.0 million in the three 
and twelve month period
s ended December 31, 2014, 
respectively.
 Errors in 
Properly Recogniz
ing
 Revenue
 34. Akorn recognized $2.9 million of revenue for a portion of a transaction with one 
of its wholesaler customers (ﬁWholesaler Aﬂ) 
even though such 
revenue was 
not 
realized or 
realizable in accordance 
with ASC 605
-10-25-1 Œ ﬁRevenue Recognition.ﬂ
1 35. In July 2014, Akorn announced a substantial price increase for 
Clobetasol 
Œ a legacy Hi
-Tech product 
Œ that would become effective in August 2014. Historically, when Akorn 
announced price increases, it wou
ld cancel customers™ existing purchase orders and reissue them 
at the new, increased price. However, in this case, Akorn shipped product to Wholesaler A 
pursuant to purchase order
s in place before the increase in price went into effect.
 36. In September 20
14, Akorn discovered this mistake, determined that it would 
ﬁrebillﬂ Wholesaler A for the difference between the old and new price 
Œ approximately $2.9 
million 
Œ and subsequently accrued for the price increase on its books. However, Wholesaler A 
informed A
korn management that it was denying Akorn™s attempt to rebill it for the $2.9 million 
because its purchase order
s were
 issued before the date when the price increase went into effect. 
In response, Akorn recorded a reserve against the revenue associated wit
h the price increase for 
the invoiced 
Clobetasol product, such that the $2.9 million was not recognized during the third 
quarter of 2014.
 37. After the third quarter of 2014, Akorn personnel in its sales and contracts groups 
continued to pursue an agreemen
t with Wholesaler A whereby it would acknowledge Akorn™s 
                                                 1 Consistent with 
GAAP
, Akorn™s
 revenue recognition policy noted that revenue is recognized when certain 
criteria are met, including the seller™s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collect
ibility is reasonably 
assured. As detailed in paragraphs 3
5-39, the price of the goods
 delivered was the disputed issue underlying the $2.9 
million recognized
, and 
Akorn did not have a basis to believe collect
ibility of the higher price was reasonably 
assured at the time it recognized the incremental revenue.
 Case: 1:18-cv-02150 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/26/18 Page 12 of 18 PageID #:12   13 billing error and pay the higher price for the relevant 
Clobetasol sales. In connection with these 
efforts, in late October 2014, Akorn™s then Senior Vice President National Accounts & Trade 
Relation
s forwarded an email to Akorn™s senior management from Wholesaler A that indicated 
Wholesaler A would pay the higher 
Clobetasol price if its purchasing division agreed that the 
product was indeed billed in error
 and the parties reached agreement on an unre
lated contractual 
allowance in dispute
. Akorn management 
did not follow
-up with Wholesaler A
 about the status 
of the two contingent issues introduced in
 this communication. Nonetheless, Akorn booked the 
$2.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014
. 38. Akorn 
did not obtain any written or verbal acknowledgment from Wholesaler A 
that it would pay the $2.9 million before booking such amount in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Instead, 
Akorn
 inappropriately relied on 
the 
email from Wholesaler A which condit
ioned 
Wholesaler A™s payment of the higher 
Clobetasol price on further review by its purchasing 
division
 and on resolution of a separate disputed item
. 39. Wholesaler A did not pay the $2.9 million in late 2014 or early 2015. In or around 
May 2015, Wholesa
ler A™s CEO told Akorn™s CEO that 
Wholesaler A
 would not pay the higher 
Clobetasol price, reiterating its prior position that Wholesaler A™s 
Clobetasol purchase orders 
were issued before the 
Clobetasol price increase went into effect. As a result, Akorn re
versed the 
$2.9 million in revenue a
s part of its 2014 restatement.

130,130,"On December 1, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his company, PlexCorps, in an emergency action to halt an alleged Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud that raised up to $15 million from thousands of investors. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps marketed and sold securities called PlexCoin on the internet to investors in the U.S. and elsewhere, claiming that investments in PlexCoin would yield a 1,354 percent profit in less than 29 days. The SEC also charged Lacroix's partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, in connection with the scheme.

Based on its filing, the SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of PlexCorps, Lacroix, and Paradis-Royer.

The SEC's complaint charges Lacroix, Paradis-Royer, and PlexCorps with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The complaint also alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties.  For Lacroix, the SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar and a bar from offering digital securities against Lacroix and Paradis-Royer."," c;-Robert A. CohenValerie A. SzczepanikJorge G.

This is an emergency action to stop Lacroix, a recidivist securities law violator inCanada, and his partner Paradis-Royer, from further misappropriating investor funds illegallyraised through the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of securities called ""PlexCoin"" orCase 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 1 of 35 PageID #: 1 ""PlexCoin Tokens"" in a putported ""Initial Coin Offering."" From August 2017 through thepresent, Defendants have obtained investor fundsŠ purportedly $15 million from thousands ofinvestors, including those throughout the United States and in this DistrictŠthrough materiallyfalse and misleading statements made by Lacroix individually and through entities Lacroixcontrols, including by promising investors returns of 1,354% in under 29 days. Lacroix andParadis-Royer misappropriated investor funds and engaged in other deceptive acts relating toinvestments in the PlexCoin Token, despite having both been enjoined by a Quebec tribunalfrom engaging in the very conduct that is the subject of this action.2. The ICO for the PlexCoin Tokens was an illegal offering of securities becausethere was no registration statement filed or in effect during its offer and sale, and no applicableexemption from registration. The PlexCoin ICO was a general solicitation made usingstatements posted on the Internet and distributed throughout the world, including in the UnitedStates, and the securities were offered to the general public and have been sold to a large numberof investors, including many in the United States and in this District.3. The stated purpose of the PlexCoin ICO was to obtain ""tokenized currency"" sothat investors could ""Take control of [THEIR] money!"" Investors in the PlexCoin ICO werepromised returns stemming from: (i) the appreciation in value of the PlexCoin Token throughinvestments PlexCorps would make with the proceeds of the PlexCoin ICO and based on themanagerial efforts of PlexCorps' team of supposed experts; (ii) the distribution to investors ofprofits from the PlexCorps enterprise; and (iii) the appreciation in value of the PlexCoin Tokensbased on efforts of PlexCorps' ""market maintenance"" team, which included listing the token ondigital asset exchanges. The PlexCoin Token currently trades under the symbol PXN.Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 2 of 35 PageID #: 2 4. Lacroix and PlexCorps enticed potential investors to purchase PlexCoin Tokensearly on during the ICO, with promises that if all 400 million PlexCoin Tokens for sale weresold, the early investors would reap outlandish rewards of 1,354% in 29 days or less (thesupposed period of the PlexCoin ICO), and by comparing the supposed returns to those in otherICOs or investments in cryptocurrenciesŠreturns as high as 88,000%.5. In connection with the PlexCoin ICO, PlexCorps and Lacroix made the followingfalse and misleading statements, among others, for which Lacroix was responsible: (a) that thePlexCorps' ""team"" consisted of a growing cadre of experts stationed around the world and with aprincipal place of business in Singapore; (b) that the identity of PlexCorps' executives had to bekept hidden to avoid poaching by competitors and for privacy concerns; (c) that the proceeds ofthe PlexCoin ICO would be used to develop other PlexCorps products; and (d) that investorscould expect ""enormous"" and ""real"" returns on PlexCoin Token investments.6. Contrary to these false representations, and as Lacroix knew or recklesslydisregarded, PlexCorps and the PlexCoin Token are a scam because: (a) there is no PlexCorpsteam, other than a handful of Lacroix's employees in Quebec working on the project, and nogroup of experts working across the globe; (b) the reason that PlexCorps did not disclose theidentity of its principal executiveŠLacroixŠwas because Lacroix was a known recidivistsecurities law violator in Canada; (c) the proceeds from the PlexCoin ICO were not destined forbusiness development but instead were intended to fund Lacroix and Paradis-Royer's expensesincluding home decor projects; and (d) there was no reasonable basis to project returns oninvestment in Defendants' scam.7. Lacroix and PlexCorps made and/or controlled the dissemination of the foregoingmisstatements and omissions in various postings on the Internet and on social media, includingCase 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 3 of 35 PageID #: 3 in a ""whitepaper"" issued by PlexCorps in connection with the offer and sale of securities duringthe PlexCoin ICO, and on webpages and Facebook accounts registered in their name, all ofwhich were accessible to United States investors via the Internet during the relevant periods.8. The funds fraudulently raised during the PlexCoin ICO have been channeledthrough various fiat currency accounts belonging to Defendants as well through cryptocurrencyaddresses under Defendants' control on various ""blockchains."" The fiat currency accountsinclude online payment services accounts in the United States that Defendants opened (directlyor indirectly) in the name of PlexCorps or its business alter egos, PlexCoin and Sidepay.Ca.Paradis-Royer herself opened and directed the disbursement of funds from some of theseaccounts, fully aware of or recklessly disregarding the dealings of her partner Lacroix.9. To skirt the registration requirements of the federal securities laws, Lacroix hasattempted to refashion the PlexCoin Tokens as a ""cryptocurrency"" and likened them to Bitcoin.In reality, PlexCoin Tokens are securities within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.10. The illegal PlexCoin ICO has occurred despite Lacroix being the subject ofprevious orders by the Quebec Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal (the ""QuebecTribunal"") enjoining him from future violations of the Quebec Securities Act, and despite havingpled guilty before a Quebec court of securities fraud.11. The foregoing illegal offering also occurred despite the Quebec Tribunal issuingan injunction in July of 2017 specifically directing Lacroix, PlexCorps, and certain companiesunder Lacroix's control, from engaging in the unregistered offering of PlexCoin Tokens, anddespite that same tribunal similarly enjoining Defendant Paradis-Royer on September 21, 2017.12. Rather than abide by the orders of the Quebec Tribunal and a contempt orderentered against Lacroix in the Quebec Superior Court, Defendants have been openly floutingCase 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 4 of 35 PageID #: 4 those orders and continue to sell and tout purchases of PlexCoin Tokens. At most, a Facebookpage related to PlexCorps indirectly acknowledged the Quebec Tribunal's injunctions, obtainedby Quebec's Autorite Des Marches Financiers (Financial Markets Authority or ""QAMF""), byoffering for sale a t-shirt with a picture of a man making an offensive gesture at the name andlogo of the QAMF.13. Throughout the relevant period, tens of thousands of investors, including over1,500 transactions with investors in the United States and many in this District, have purchasedapproximately 81 million PlexCoin Tokens for approximately $15,000,000. Of those amounts,approximately $810,000 is currently held in three accounts to which Lacroix and his associateswill soon gain access. Defendants have misappropriated or attempted to misappropriate at least$200,000 of these amounts on extravagant personal expenditures. Other amounts are believed tocurrently reside on Bitcoin or other blockchain addresses or wallets that Defendants control.VIOLATIONS14.

An ICQ is a fundraising event in which an entity offers participants a unique""coin"" or ""token"" in exchange for consideration (often in the form of crypto or fiat currency).28. The tokens are issued on a ""blockchain"" or cryptographically secured ledger.'29. Generally, coins or tokens may entitle holders to certain rights related to a ventureunderlying the ICQ, such as rights to profits, shares of assets, rights to use certain servicesprovided by the issuer, and/or voting rights. These coins or tokens may also be listed on onlineplatforms, often called virtual currency exchanges, and tradable for crypto or fiat currency.Often, the coins or tokens are immediately tradable.30. ICOs are typically announced and promoted through public online channels.Issuers usually release a ""whitepaper"" describing the project and the terms of the ICQ. Toparticipate, investors are generally required to transfer funds to the issuer's address, onlinewallet, payment processor, or other account. After the completion of the ICG, the issuer willdistribute its unique coin or token to the participants' unique address on the blockchain.' A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across anetwork, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions,including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in achain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. Ablockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Bitcoinblockchain is an example of a ""non-permissioned,"" or public and open accessblockchain. Anyone can download the Bitcoin open-source software and join. All participantsshare a single view of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is updated when Bitcoin networkparticipants reach a consensus on the validity of transactions under review. ""Permissioned"" orprivate blockchains are modifications to that model and require permissioned servers to beapproved to participate on the network or to access particular information on theblockchain. Blockchains or distributed ledgers can also record what are called smart contracts,which essentially are computer programs designed to execute the terms of a contract whencertain triggering conditions are met.Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 9 of 35 PageID #: 9 31. In some instances, the coins or tokens may continue to be sold by the originalissuer after the ICO has completed. In others, they may only be obtained by purchasing them onsecondary markets.FACTSLacroix's History as a Recidivist Securities Law Violator in Canada32. Since at least 2011, Lacroix has been the subject of several Canadian courtproceedings involving the fraudulent raising of investor funds.33. In 2011, the QAMF charged Lacroix and a company he controlled called Micro-Prets, Inc. (or ""Small-Loans"" in French) (""Micro-Frets""), with offering unregistered investmentsin Micro-Frets, purportedly in the loan business. On July 15, 2011, a division of the QuebecTribunal issued an ex parte order enjoining Lacroix and Micro-Frets from further violations. SeeAutorite Des Marches Financiers v. Micro-Frets, Inc.. 2011 QCBDR 60 (QC 2011). On August10,2011, the Quebec Tribunal rejected in all relevant parts Lacroix's request that the injunctionentered on July 15, 2011, be lifted. S^ Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Micro-Frets, Inc.,2011 QBCDR 70 (QC 2011).34. On November 2, 2011, Lacroix and Micro-Frets signed an undertakingrepresenting to the Quebec Tribunal and to the QAMF that they would not conduct anyadditional securities transactions, including through transactions through the Internet.35. On February 28, 2013, Lacroix and Micro-Frets pled guilty before a Quebectribunal to three counts each, including making materially false statements in connection with theoffer and sale of, securities, and were ordered to pay over $25,000 Canadian Dollars in criminalpenalties, arising out of the same scheme as the 2011 proceedings.10Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 10 of 35 PageID #: 10 36. Despite his 2011 undertaking and 2013 guilty plea and conviction, Lacroix ranafoul of the Quebec Securities Act at least once more earlier this year. On June 13, 2017, theQuebec Tribunal issued another order against Lacroix, DL Innov, Gestio, and Micro-Prets,having found sufficient evidence that Lacroix and those entities had raised over $2 million USDfrom over thirty investors to whom they had promised high returns if they invested in Micro-Frets' lending business, and again enjoining them from additional securities-related transactions.See Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Lacroix, 2017 QCTMF 63 (QC 2017).Defendants Begin Marketing the PlexCoin ICQ37. Undeterred by the foregoing actions, Lacroix launched his latest scam, thePlexCoin ICO, starting at least as early as June of 2017.38. In mid to late June of 2017, on a Facebook page for PlexCoin with the Facebookaddress @plexcoin (the ""PlexCoin Facebook Page""), Lacroix and PlexCorps announced thePlexCoin ""ICO pre-sale launch"" scheduled for August 7, 2017. The PlexCoin Facebook Pagedescribed the PlexCoin Token as ""the next decentralized worldwide cryptocurrency based on theEthereum structure"" whose ""mission is to broaden the possibilities of uses and to increase thenumber of users by simplifying the process of managing cryptocurrency to the maximum.""39. On or around July 5, 2017, Lacroix and PlexCorps also launched a Facebook pagefor PlexCorps with a Facebook address @plexcorps (the ""PlexCorps Facebook Page""), in whichthey stated that PlexCorps consisted of ""a group of roughly forty people (programmers,engineers, cryptocurrency specialists, etc.) all independent throughout the world and orientedtowards the same goal: ""To increase accessibility to cryptoservices by simplifying its managingprocess."" The same post noted that PlexCorps ""decided not to reveal the identities of our team to11Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 11 of 35 PageID #: 11 make sure no one is getting harassed on social media or recruited by other cr3^tocurrencycompanies, thus preventing the concept of PlexCorps from being copied.""40. A later post on the PlexCorps Facebook Page stated that the PlexCorps team was""grow[ing]... every day"" and that it consisted of ""more than 48 all around the world.""41. Lacroix registered the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages and was at allrelevant times the administrator for both accounts. A credit card account in Lacroix's name wasassociated with the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages. On several occasions immediatelybefore and during the sale of PlexCoin Tokens to the public, logins were made to both accountsfrom an IP address previously associated with Lacroix and his businesses, DL Innov and Gestio(""Defendants' IP Address"").42. The PlexCorps and PlexCoin Facebook Pages were accessible via the Internet topotential investors in the United States.43. On or around July of 2017, Lacroix, directly or indirectly, also launched websitesfor PlexCorps and PlexCoin. Lacroix registered at least some of these websites with an intemetservice provider on or around May 24, 2017, including websites with URLshttp://www.plexcoin.org, http://www.plexcoin.com, http://www.plexbank.com, andhttp://www.plexwallet.com, and paid for these registrations in his name. These websites wereaccessible via the Intemet to potential investors in the United States.44. Lacroix also registered and paid for Intemet security services with respect to theURLs http://www.plexcoin.com, http://www.plexcoin.org, and http://www.plexcorps.com,starting at least on July 1, 2017.45. Like the PlexCorps Facebook Page, PlexCorps' website, accessible via the URLhttp://www.plexcorps.com (the ""PlexCorps Website""), described PlexCorps as ""a group of forty12Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 12 of 35 PageID #: 12 people ... all independent throughout the world and oriented towards the same goal: To increaseaccessibility to cryptoservices by simplifying the managing process.""46. The PlexCorps Website listed four additional products offered by PlexCorp, eachwith a unique logo: PlexCoin, PlexWallet, PlexCard, and PlexBank. The logo for PlexCoinlinked users to PlexCoin's website at http://www.plexcoin.com (the ""PlexCoin Website""), andindicated that PlexCoin was at the ""Pre-Sale Waiting List"" stage. The logo for the other productsindicated that they were projected to be launched later in 2017 and or in 2018.47. The PlexCorps Website also directed readers to the PlexCorps Facebook Page.48. From at least July 2017 through the present, the PlexCoin Website states that""PlexCorps presents: PlexCoin,"" which the PlexCoin Website describes as ""a cryptocurrency ...that has a value based on the current market."" In July of 2017, the PlexCoin Website announcedthe ""ICO"" for PlexCoin Tokens would begin on August 7, 2017, and that the pre-sale period wascurrently open to potential investors.49. Under a section entitled ""Frequently Asked Questions"" on the PlexCoin Website,the answer to the question of ""How to Invest?"" instructed users that they would ""have to enter[their] email address"" so that ""at the launch of the pre-sale on August 7, [they] will be able tobuy [their] PlexCoin at a discounted price and in priority, and enjoy a return of 1,354% on yourinvestment!""50. The PlexCoin Website explained that ""[a]n Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is aderivative from the known expression IPO (Initial Public Offering, or stock market launch)which refers to cryptocurrency fundraiser. An ICO can allow the financing of a new blockchain,but in most cases, the ICO is set up to issue a token, a coin or creating a Dapp (decentralizedapplication) based on an already existing blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.""13Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 13 of 35 PageID #: 13 51. In July of 2017, the PlexCoin Facebook Page and the PlexCoin Website bothannounced that a ""whitepaper"" for PlexCoin Tokens (the ""PlexCoin Whitepaper"") would beavailable on August 4, 2017, that the PlexCoin ICO ""pre-sale"" would begin on August 7, 2017,and that PlexCoin Tokens would officially ""launch"" on September 5, 2017.52. Answering the question ""What is the anticipated return on investment (ROI)?,""the PlexCoin Website explained that the return depended ""on the sale stage you will be at whenpurchase your PlexCoin."" The PlexCoin Website further explain that the first 50 millionPlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of $0.13 U.S. Dollars (""USD""), the following50 million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of $0.28 USD, the following 100million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of $0.53 USD, and the last 200 millionPlexCoin Tokens (for a total of 400 million coins sold), would be sold at the equivalent of $0.88USD. Based on the foregoing discounting scheme, the PlexCoin Website projected thatinvestors in PlexCoin Tokens would obtain a ""projected return on investment"" after 29 days,depending on where and when in the discount scheme the investor purchased PlexCoin, of either1,354%, 629%, 332%, or 200%.53. Elsewhere, the PlexCoin Website explained that after the 29 days of the pre-sale,""the value ... will be 1,76 $ [sic] per PlexCoin and it is from that date forward that the valueshould normally increase, as PlexCoin will be from that moment available on the open market.""The PlexCoin Website also explained that the $1.76 USD value assumed that 400 millionPlexCoin Tokens were sold during the PlexCoin pre-sale, but other materials expressedconfidence that all 400 PlexCoin Tokens would be sold and stated that even if fewer were sold,investors would still reap returns that were ""real"" and commensurate to amounts sold.14Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 14 of 35 PageID #: 14 54. From July 2017 through at least October 1, 2017, the PlexCoin Website explainedto investors that they would be able to purchase PlexCoin Tokens during the ICG with eitherUSD, Canadian Dollars (""CAD""), Euros, Bitcoin, Ether (which the PlexCoin Website calls""Ethereum""), and Litecoin.The Quebec Tribunal Enjoins Defendants from Continuing the PlexCoin ICG55. On July 19, 2017, the QAMF made an ex parte application to the Quebec Tribunalbased on many of the foregoing PlexCoin Token marketing efforts and asking, inter alia, that theQuebec Tribunal enjoin Lacroix, PlexCoin, PlexCorps, Gestio, and DL Innov from offering ordistributing investments in PlexCoin Tokens.56. On July 20, 2017, the Quebec Tribunal granted the QAMF's request (the ""JulyOrder"") having concluded, as it explained at a later date, that the PlexCoin Token was a""security"" under the laws of Quebec, relying in part on the United States Supreme Court decisionin SEC V. Howev. 328 U.S. 293 (1946). See also Financial Markets Authoritv v. Plexcorps,TMS, Montreal, 2017-023-001 (July 20, 2017); Financial Markets Authoritv v. Plexcorps, et al.,TMS, Montreal, 2017-023-001 (Sept. 13, 2017).57. In the July Order, the Quebec Tribunal ordered PlexCorps, PlexCoin, DL Innov,Gestio, and Lacroix to, inter alia:a. ""cease engaging directly or indirectly in any activity for the purpose ofmaking any transaction on any form of investment,b. ""withdraw any advertising or solicitation of the same nature as that made onthe Internet sites www.plexcorps.com and www.plexcoin.com, Facebook, anyInternet forums or others, or in relation to securities or any form ofinvestment, whether advertised or disseminated, over the Internet orotherwise, directly or indirectly, [and]c. ""shut down the Internet sites www.plexcorps.com and www.plexcoin.com orany other site of the same nature as those sites, advertised or disseminated,directly or indirectly, by the latter or, failing that, to render them inaccessible15Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 15 of 35 PageID #: 15 to any IP address in Quebec so as to prevent anyone residing in Quebec fromvisiting these Internet sites.""58. The Quebec Tribunal's July Order also ordered a Facebook subsidiary in Canadato shut down the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages from accessibility in Quebec.59. On July 21, 2017, the QAMF served Defendants PlexCoin, PlexCorps, andLacroix, as well as Lacroix's entities DL Innov and Gestio with the Quebec Tribunal's JulyOrder and, on that day. Defendant Lacroix filed a notice of dispute against the decision.60. But Lacroix and PlexCorps did not abide by the Quebec Tribunal's July Order.On October 17, 2017, the Superior Court of Quebec held Lacroix in contempt of the July Order.Sanctions against Lacroix are currently pending for that contempt order.Defying the Quebec Tribunal's Iniunctions, Defendants Continue to Market the PlexCoinTokens to Investors and Begin Raising Investor Funds61. Rather than ceasing advertisement and solicitations for PlexCoin Tokens asrequired by the July Order, Lacroix and PlexCorps took several steps in open defiance of theQuebec Tribunal's July Order including, as further detailed below, (a) publishing a ""whitepaper""for PlexCoin (the ""PlexCoin Whitepaper"") on August 4, 2017; (b) registering online paymentservices accounts to receive PlexCoin investor funds and receiving investor funds through thoseaccounts; (c) shutting down the PlexCoin Website from Quebec IP addresses (but not U.S.addresses) but then registering the domain http://www.plexcoin.tech on August 18, 2017; and (d)posting additional social media and online advertisements for PlexCoin, including in newFacebook accounts associated with PlexCorps and its businesses.62. Lacroix made some of the foregoing attempts to evade the Quebec Tribunal's JulyOrder by enlisting the help of his partner, Paradis-Royer, and by obscuring his involvement withthe registration of new domains or accounts by using a fake name, including but not limited to16Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 16 of 35 PageID #: 16 ""San Lee,"" or ""See Lam,"" and/or using email addresses that belonged to or were under hiscontrol.63. Paradis-Royer did her part to conceal Lacroix's involvement by, for example,registering certain digital payments accounts under her name or purporting to use those accountsfor a fictional business called ""Sidepay.Ca,"" which was really Defendants' alter ego.64. By at least August 3, 2017, the PlexCoin Website stated that ""PlexCorps' team isconstantly working on .. . developing"" certain products associated with PlexCoin Tokens, suchas the PlexWallet and PlexCard, and that the PlexCoin ICO would begin on August 8.65. On or around August 4, 2017, Lacroix and PlexCorps published the PlexCoinWhitepaper on the Internet, which was available to potential investors in the United States.66. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained PlexCoin's logo on the front page,PlexCoin's and PlexCorps' logos in the interim pages, and linked to PlexCoin's and PlexCorps'Websites and Facebook Pages.67. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained many of the same statements that Defendantspreviously made to investors in their various online postings through the summer of 2017.68. For example, the PlexCoin Whitepaper explained that the PlexCoin ""pre-sale""would run during the 29 days from August 7 through September 5, 2017, but set September 10,2017 as the ""launch"" for PlexCoin secondary market trading. The PlexCoin Whitepaper, likeprevious statements by Lacroix and PlexCorps, directed users to register for the ""pre-sale"" byentering their email address in the registration tab of the PlexCoin Website, and advisedinvestors that they could purchase PlexCoin through USD, CAD, Euros, Bitcoin, Ether, orLitecoin.17Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 17 of 35 PageID #: 17 69.

134,134,"Washington D.C., March 22, 2018 - This past week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former chief information officer of a U.S. business unit of Equifax with insider trading in advance of the company's September 2017 announcement about a massive data breach that exposed the social security numbers and other personal information of about 148 million U.S. customers.

According to the SEC's complaint, Jun Ying, who was next in line to be the company's global CIO, allegedly used confidential information entrusted to him by the company to conclude that Equifax had suffered a serious breach.  The SEC alleges that before Equifax's public disclosure of the data breach, Ying exercised all of his vested Equifax stock options and then sold the shares, reaping proceeds of nearly $1 million.  According to the complaint, by selling before public disclosure of the data breach, Ying avoided more than $117,000 in losses.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia announced parallel criminal charges against Ying.

The SEC's complaint charges Ying with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries.  The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 8. Jun Ying
, age 42, is a resident of Atlanta, Georgia.  He was an employee of 
Equifax Inc. 
from January 2013 until October 2017, and was the Chief Information 
Officer (ﬁCIOﬂ) of Equifax™s United States Information Systems (ﬁUSISﬂ) 
business unit at the time of his departure.
  At the time of the Equifax breach, 
Ying 
was a leading candidate to succ
eed the then
-current global CIO of Equifax, and 
was, in fact, offered the job on September 15, 2017.  
As CIO of USIS
, Ying was 
often entrusted wit

. STATEMENT OF FACTS
 I. THE 
EQUIFAX 
CYBERSECURITY 
BREACH
. 10. On July 29, 
2017, 
Equifax™s security department observed suspicious 
network traffic associated with the company™s consumer dispute portal, 
which is a 
part of Equifax™s website where consumers dispute items on their credit repo
rts.
 11. In response, the security department immedi
ately blocked the suspicious 
traffic and continued to monitor the network.  The next day, after observing 
additional suspicious activity, the security depar
tment took the portal offline.
 12. On August 2, 
2017, 
Equifax retaine
d th
e 
cybersecurity group at an
 Atl
anta 
law firm
 to investigate the incident and provide legal and regulatory advice.  That 
same day, 
Equifax, through the law firm, engaged
 an independent cybersecurity 
forensic consulting firm.
 Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 4 of 19 5  13. Over 
the next several weeks, the 
cybersecurity forensic consult
ing firm
 and
 Equifax™s 
internal 
security department analyzed forensic data to determine
 the 
nature 
and scope 
of the suspicious activity.  It was determined that 
Equifax had 
been subject to
 cyber
-intrusions that resulted in 
a breach 
of Equifax™
s information
 technology (ﬁ
ITﬂ)
 system
s. 14. In accordance with 
Equifax™s internal policies
, the company classified the 
breach as a ﬁcritical incidentﬂ and formed a crisis action team, comprised of 
secu
rity, legal, and IT personnel.
 15. The company designated the response to the breach as ﬁProject Sierra,ﬂ and 
instructed those working on Project Sierra that information related to the project 
was confidential and should not be 
shared
 with anyone outside of 
Equifax™s crisis 
action team
. 16. The
 forensic investigators determined that
, in connection with the breach, 
it 
was likely that 
sensitive data
, including 
consumers™ personally identifiable 
information (ﬁPIIﬂ)
, had been stolen
.  Equifax
 then 
instituted a special trading 
blackout period for tho
se working on Project Sierra.
  Trading blackout periods 
are 
typically implemented
 pursuant to a company™s insider trading policy 
to prevent 
trading by insiders when significant events 
or changes 
are taking place within the 
company.
 Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 5 of 19 6  17. As part of its response 
to the breach, Equifax also deployed additional 
security measures to protect the company™s network
.  For example, b
etween 
August 12 and 15,
 2017,
 Project Sier
ra team members changed
 administrative 
credentials for hundreds of internal databases.  The so
-called ﬁpassword resetﬂ 
required the assistance of a broader group of Equifax IT employees who were not 
informed of the breach
. 18. Equifax also established a notification and remediation 
plan for the millions 
of consumers affected by the breach.  This 
effort
, which the company designated 
ﬁProject Sparta,ﬂ involved setting up a website for consumers to determine whether 
they were affected by the breach, developing a suite of protective tool
s for 
consume
rs, and staffing call centers.
 19. Project Sparta was kept separate from Project Sierra to limit the number of 
people who knew that Eq
uifax itself had been breached.  T
hose Equifax employees 
who were only part of Project Sparta 
were not told
 that 
Equifax had been breached, 
but 
were 
instead 
told t
hat they were working for an unnamed 
client that had 
experienced a large data
 breach
. 20. The company decided to handle
 much of the work for Project Sparta
 through 
its own Global Consumer Solutions business unit (ﬁGCSﬂ), which developed and 
Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 6 of 19 7  sold various personal security and identity theft defense products and services to 
clients.
 21. On August 23, 2017, 
one of Ying™s peers, 
the CIO o
f another Equifax 
business u
nit
, was informed of the breach
.  He was also 
asked to
 lead 
the 
notification and remediation efforts that 
composed 
Project Sparta
. 22. Ying wa
s not informed of Project Sierra or Project Sparta at that time, n
or was he made aware of
 his col
league™s appointment 
to lead the soon
-to
-be 
implemented
 notification and 
remediation efforts.
 II. YING IS 
ENTRUSTED WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT
 THE 
BREACH
.  23. At 2:22 p.m. on
 Friday, August 25, 2017
, as part
 of Project Sparta
, an email 
was 
sent to 
several Equifax IT personnel who 
were responsible for the systems that 
would handle the breach remediation efforts, as well as the CIOs o
f certain 
business units.  
Ying
 was among the CIOs included
. 24. The email stated that GCS was working on a ﬁ
VERY
 large breach 
opportunityﬂ that required a 
dramatic increase in the capacity of the relevant 
technology systems, and that this was ﬁan extremely time sensitive request,ﬂ
 with a 
deadline of August 29
, 2017
. 25. Ying initially instructed his direct reports not to work on the project until 
they received a
dditional information
. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 7 of 19 8  26. At 4:33 p.m.
 that afternoon, Ying
 (among other IT personnel, including 
several
 of his direct reports)
 received a calendar appointment invitation for a 
conference call at 4:45 p.m. with the subject, ﬁURGENT / MANDATORY 
MEETING 
Œ Breach Opportunity.ﬂ  
The invitation
 stated that 
Equifax
™s global 
CIO for
 all 
company 
operations
, who was Ying™s immediate supervisor, 
wanted 
the group to get ﬁonboard on this ASAP,ﬂ 
and that participants should prepare the 
IT applications
 under their care
 to handle approximately 10 million customers.  
 27. Ying did not initially participate in the c
onference call, but 
an IT employee
 who reported directly to Ying
 was on the call.  Du
ring the call,
 Ying
 and his direct 
report
 exchan
ged text messages in which the 
direct report
 informed Ying that 
Ying™s team would have to cancel their Friday evening
 plans to respond to the 
Project Sparta requests.
 28. Ying then joined the conference call, and 
initially resisted the 
requests for 
assistance
.  He
 also expressed concern tha
t the dead
line was unrealistic.  In 
response, the leader of Project Spar
ta instructed Ying to call the g
lobal CIO
 with 
his concerns.
 III. YING 
CONCLUDES 
THAT 
EQUIFAX WAS THE 
REAL 
VICTIM
 OF THE 
BREACH
. 29. At 5:26 p.m., Ying called the g
lobal CIO.  The call las
ted only one minute.
 Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 8 of 19 9  30. During the call, the global CIO told Ying
 that Ying
 was expected to comply 
with the requests.
  The global CIO also
 told Ying that
, at that time,
 Ying did not 
need to know why he had to comply, but that at some point, Ying would 
understand what was 
happening
. 31. At 5:27 p.m., Ying texted the direct report he had communicated with 
earlier, writing
:  ﬁOn the phone wi
th [g
lobal CIO]
.  Sounds bad. 
 We may
 be the 
one breached. 
. . . Starting t
o put 2 and 2 together.ﬂ
 32. After that call, Ying™s demeanor towards the requests for assistance 
changed
.  Just three
 minutes later, at 5:30 p.m., the Project Sparta leader
 texted 
Ying to ask whether Ying had 
any 
question
s after speaking to the g
lobal CIO
.  Ying responded, ﬁNo question right now. Actually, I don™t want to know ;) I told 
the team to [rally].ﬂ
  Ying™s team began responding to the requests for assistance.
 33. Numerous additional communications the evening of Augu
st 25
, 2017
, informed Ying that this breach was unu
sual, and in
dicate that Ying used the
 information entrusted to him as an Equifax employee to conclude
 that Equifax was 
the victim of the breach
, and 
that 
the ﬁbreach op
portunityﬂ idea suggesting a
 client 
was
 the victim was
 merely a cover story
. 34. At 5:34 p.m., Ying called Equifax™s 
global 
CIO again, and the two discussed 
the fact that the breach response plan, which called for offering 
credit bureau 
Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 9 of 19 10  report
s from all three 
credit 
bureaus
 to 50 million
 consumers
, would be highly 
unusual and would 
strain the company™s resources.
 35. At 5:50 p.m., Ying ex
changed text messages with the same direct report he 
had texted with earlier that afternoon.  In the texts,
 both 
men 
expressed that the 
breach situation was 
ﬁcrazy,ﬂ and Ying stated that the company had ﬁsome crisis 
scenarios like thi
s,ﬂ 
referencing Equifax™s Crisis Management Plan, which, among 
other things, provi
ded a plan for responding to
 a breach of Equifax™s systems
. 36. In fact, 
as 
part of the company™s 
training in support of the Crisis 
Management Plan
, Ying previously had participated in
 a 
simulated 
crisis 
scenario 
in which
 Equifax™s CIO was unavailable following a cybersecurity breach, and
 Ying 
was asked to step
 into the role of 
CIO for purposes of 
formulating a response
. 37. At 6:19 p.m., another IT employee
 who reported to Ying emailed Ying
 regarding a series of meetings
 (unrelated to the breach)
 that were scheduled for the 
week of August 28
, 2017
, and were to take place in different states
.  These 
mee
tings were to include executives from
 Equifax
™s IT, Legal, and Security 
departments, as well as
 their counterpart
s at
 certain major retailers
, and related to 
the bus
iness relationships between Equifax and the retailers
. 38. The IT employee
 informed Ying that a
 number of senior le
adership 
members, including the g
lobal CIO and the leader of Project Sparta
, as well as 
Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 10 of 19 11  Equifax™s Chief Security Officer (ﬁCSOﬂ), Chief Legal Officer, and VP of 
Cybersecurity, were cancelling their 
travel plans.
 39. Ying confirmed the cance
llations, and, in 
his reply 
emails, stated ﬁI think 
you now know why
.ﬂ  He also stated that he thought 
the travel cancellations were 
ﬁrela
ted to all the mad scrambling . . . .
ﬂ 40. At 8:55 p.m., yet another IT employee
 who reported to Ying forwarded Ying 
email
s from Equifax™s Senior Director of Crisis Management asking for log files 
for a specific database.  The employee 
told Ying that he had concerns about 
producing the files to security and was unsure whether this related to the breach 
opportunity that was di
scussed o
n the earlier conference call.
 41. At 8;59 p.m., 
Ying responded
: ﬁYup. Cooperate.ﬂ
  At this point, the 
securities market had been closed for several hours, and would not reopen until 
Monday morning, August 28, 2017.
 42. At approximately 10:00 a.m.
 on Monday, 
August 28, 2017
, Ying
 used a 
search engine to find information on the internet 
concerning the September 2015 
cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, 
and the impact that breach 
had 
on Experian™s stock price. 
 The search terms used 
by 
Ying were: (1) ﬁExperian breach
ﬂ; (2) ﬁExperian stock price 9
/15/2015
ﬂ; and 
(3) ﬁExperian breach 2015.ﬂ
 Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 11 of 19 12  43. These searches
 yielded results revealing
 that
, although the breach at 
Experian was much smaller than the one that Equifax face
d, the
 public 
announcement of Experian™s
 breac
h negatively impacted that company™s
 stock 
price.  
Ying™s internet browsing history indicates that Ying reviewed market 
data 
showing
 that Experian™s stock price dropped approximately four percent after the 
publ
ic announcement of the breach.
 44. By no later than 10:00 a.m. on August 28
, 2017, 
based on nonpublic 
information entrusted to him by his employer, Equifax, Ying had 
concluded that 
Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach, despite the
 stat
ements made as part of
 Project Sparta
 asserting that it was a business 
opportunity
 for an unnamed client.
 45. Ying owed a duty of trust and confidence to Equifax and its shareholders not 
to trade on the basis of material nonpublic information that he learned t
hrough his 
employment with Equifax, and
 was aware of his duty.
 46. Ying knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax 
was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was material. 
 47. Ying knew or was reckless in not knowing that the inform
ation that Equifax 
was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was nonpublic.

™S TRADING IN 
EQUIFAX 
SECURITIES
. 48. Ying received a portion of his compensation through stock option grants and 
restricted shares.  
While Ying had exercised some of his
 options previously, a
s of 
October 1, 2016, Ying held 6,815 vested options, which he continued to hold until 
August 28, 2017.
 49. Within an
 hour
 of running the internet searches regarding 
the September 
2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian
, Ying accessed his c
ompany
-sponsored 
stock plan account
 with UBS Financial Services, Inc.
, exercised all of his vested 
options
 to buy Equifax shares
, and 
then immediately sold 
those 
Equifax
 shares
 for 
total proceeds of more than $950,000.
   50. These securities transactions were 
made on the basis of material nonpublic 
information
 and breached the duty of trust and confidence that Ying owed to 
Equifax and its shareholders
.  Ying 
knew or was reckless in not knowing that the 
information that Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was 
material and nonpublic, and Ying 
used 
that information when making
 these 
securities transactions.  
 51. By selling Equifax shares be
fore its cybersecurity breach was publicly 
disclosed
, Ying avoided 
more than
 $117,000
 in losses that he would have suffered 
had he not sold until after the news of the breach became public

BREACH
. 53. On August 29, 2017, t
he 
day
 after exercising his options
 and selling Equifax 
shares
, Ying was traveling for business when he was unexpectedly call
ed back to 
Atlanta by Equifax™s global CIO.  The g
lobal CIO did not tell Ying why he needed 
him to return.
 54. Shortly 
after
 receiving instructions to return to Atlanta
, Ying sent a text 
message to a work colleague at Equifax.  Among other things, Ying™s text 
told the 
colleague
 that he thought there was going to be ﬁsome big media announcementﬂ 
about Equifax, that ﬁit might be bad,ﬂ and that it was why ﬁeveryone was 
cancelling trips this week and even next.ﬂ
 55. On August 30,
 2017, Ying was back in Atlanta. 
 The g
lobal CIO for Equifax 
officially 
told Ying that Equifax 
was the entity that 
had been breached.  Ying then 
met with one of the attorneys enga
ged by Equifax
, who confirmed for Ying 
what 
the g
lobal CIO had said, and gave him a set of instructions and direction
s that had 
been 
developed for that situation, 
i.e.
, when an Equifax employee was told that 
Equifax was the entity that had been breached
.  After receiving the instructions and 
directions, s

employee
s then
 became part of 
the 
Project Sierra
 team.

that Ying had already traded, t
he attorney
 told Ying that the news 
about the breach was confidential
, should not be shared with anyone
, and that Ying 
should not trade in Equifax securities.
  Ying did not volunteer the fact that he had 
exercised and 
sold al
l of his vested Equifax options two days before.
 VI.
 EQUIFAX 
TELLS THE 
PUBLIC ABOUT THE 
BREACH
. 57. After the close of the market on September 7, 2017, Equifax issued a press 
release and filed a Form 8
-K with the Commission, announcing the cybersecurity 
breach
 and revealing that it potentially impacted approximately 143 million 
consumers in the United States.
 58. The breach was one of the leading news stories over the next several days 
and was described as ﬁone of the worst [data breaches] ever, by its reach and by
 the 
kind of inform
ation exposed to the public.ﬂ
 59. On September 8, the price of Equifax common stock closed at $123.23, a 
drop of $19.49
 (nearly 14
%) per share from the prior day™s closing price of 
$142.72.  Trading volume that day also increased dramaticall
y to nearly seventeen 
million shares, more than a thirty
-fold increase from the previous day™s volume o
f approximately 518,000 shares.
 60. On September 15, 2017, following the resignation of the then
-current global 
CIO, Ying was offered the position of global 
CIO of Equifax.  The offer was 
Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 15 of 19 16  subsequently withdrawn, however, after Equifax senior executives learned of 
Ying™s
 trading.
 61. On October 16, 
2017, 
following an internal
 Equifax
 investigation into 
Ying™s trading
, the company 
concluded that he had violated the 
company™s insider 
trading policy
 and that his employment should be terminated.
  At that time, Ying 
agreed to resign

 Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 19 of 19"
135,135,"On March 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced securities fraud charges against a U.K.-based broker-dealer and its investment manager in connection with manipulative trading in the securities of HD View 360 Inc., a U.S.-based microcap issuer.  The SEC also announced charges against HD View's CEO, another individual, and three entities they control for manipulating HD View's securities as well as the securities of another microcap issuer, West Coast Ventures Group Corp.  The SEC further announced the institution of an order suspending trading in the securities of HD View.

These charges arise in part from an undercover operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which also resulted in related criminal prosecutions against these defendants by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Beaufort Securities Ltd. and Peter Kyriacou, an investment manager at Beaufort, manipulated the market for HD View's common stock.  The scheme involved an undercover FBI agent who described his business as manipulating U.S. stocks through pump-and-dump schemes.  Kyriacou and the agent discussed depositing large blocks of microcap stock in Beaufort accounts, driving up the price of the stock through promotions, manipulating the stock's price and volume through matched trades, and then selling the shares for a large profit.

The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou alleges that they:

opened brokerage accounts for the undercover agent in the names of nominees in order to conceal his identity and his connection to the anticipated trading activity in the accounts
suggested that the undercover agent could create the false appearance that HD View's stock was liquid in advance of a pump-and-dump by ""gam[ing] the market"" through matched trades
executed multiple purchase orders of HD View shares with the understanding that Beaufort's client had arranged for an associate to simultaneously offer an equivalent number of shares at the same price
A second complaint filed by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleges that in a series of recorded telephone conversations with the undercover agent, HD View CEO Dennis Mancino and William T. Hirschy agreed to manipulate HD View's common stock by using the agent's network of brokers to generate fraudulent retail demand for the stock in exchange for a kickback from the trading proceeds.  According to the complaint, the three men agreed that Mancino and Hirschy would manipulate HD View stock to a higher price before using the agent's brokers to liquidate their positions at an artificially inflated price.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Mancino and Hirschy executed a ""test trade"" on Jan. 31, 2018, coordinated by the agent, consisting of a sell order placed by the defendants filled by an opposing purchase order placed by a broker into an account at Beaufort.  Unbeknownst to Mancino and Hirschy, the Beaufort account used for this trade was a nominal account that was opened and funded by the agent.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that, prior to their contact with the undercover agent, Mancino and Hirschy manipulated the market for HD View and for West Coast by using brokerage accounts that they owned, controlled, or were associated with –including TJM Investments Inc., DJK Investments 10 Inc., WT Consulting Group LLC – to effect manipulative ""matched trades.""

The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also charged Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, and penny stock bars from Beaufort and Kyriacou.  With respect to Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities, the SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, penny stock bars, and an officer-and-director bar against Mancino.

The investigation was conducted in the SEC's New York Regional Office by Tejal Shah and Joseph Darragh, Lorraine Collazo, and Michael D. Paley of the Microcap Fraud Task Force and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban, and in Washington, D.C. by Patrick L. Feeney, Robert Nesbitt, and Kevin Guerrero, and supervised by Antonia Chion.  Preethi Krishnamurthy and Ms. Shah will lead the SEC's litigation against Beaufort and Kyriacou.  Ann H. Petalas and Mr. Feeney, under the supervision of Cheryl Crumpton, will handle the SEC's litigation against Mancino, Hirschy, and their entities.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Alberta Securities Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The Commission's investigation in this matter is continuing.","MARC P. BERGER

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED 
                         Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commissi
on (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint 
against defendants Beaufort Securities Limited (ﬁBeaufortﬂ) and Panayiotis Kyriacou a/k/a Peter 

Kyriacou (ﬁKyriacouﬂ) (together, ﬁDefendantsﬂ), alleges as follows: 
SUMMARY 
1.In at least early 2018, Defendants Beaufo
rt and KyriacouŠa United Kingdom-based 
brokerage firm and its U.K.-based investment 
managerŠintentionally fa
cilitated a scheme to 
manipulate the market of microcap 
stock publicly-traded in the United States and registered with the 
Commission.  
Case 2:18-cv-01317   Document 1   Filed 03/02/18   Page 1 of 17 PageID #: 1  2 2.Starting in 2016, an undercover agent (the 
ﬁUndercoverﬂ) with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation presented himself to Kyriacou and Beaufort as some
one involved in the business of arranging pump-and-dump transactions in U.S. microcap securities.
1   3.In December 2017, the Undercover told Kyriacou that he was working on a deal 
involving a stock traded on the U.S. over-the-c
ounter (ﬁOTCﬂ) market, HD View 360 Inc. (ﬁHD 
Viewﬂ), and wanted to create the appearance that the stock was actively trading.  
4.Kyriacou suggested that the Undercover 
engage in what Kyriacou called ﬁmatchﬂ 
trading through Beaufort, which Kyriacou said he
 did ﬁwith a lot of c
lients.ﬂ Kyriacou later 
described these trades as selling the Undercover™s sh
ares to either the Undercover himself or to the 
Undercover™s ﬁguy.ﬂ Kyriacou understood th
at the trades would ﬁgame the market.ﬂ  
5.In January and February 2018, Kyriacou 
arranged for Beaufort to enter four 
purchase orders of HD View stock for the Unde
rcover™s brokerage accounts. Before Beaufort 
entered these purchase orders, the Undercover told
 Kyriacou that the Undercover had arranged for 
complicit brokerage firms to simultaneously offer to
 sell an equivalent number of shares from other 
accounts the Undercover™s associates controlled.  
6.One of these purchase orders resulted in a matched trade in which the Undercover™s 
account purchased shares from one of HD View™s significant shareholders, with whom the 
Undercover had previously arranged
 the matching sell order.    
7.This matched trade almost doubled HD View™s stock price.  
  1  A pump-and-dump scheme involves fraudulent
ly ﬁpumpingﬂ up a stoc
k™s price or trading volume so that a shareholder can then ﬁdumpﬂ the shares by selling them for a profit. 
Case 2:18-cv-01317   Document 1   Filed 03/02/18   Page 2 of 17 PageID #: 2  3 VIOLATIONS 
8.By virtue of the foregoing conduct and as 
alleged further herein, 
Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and 
Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5(a) and (c)]. 
9.Unless Defendants are restrained and enjoin
ed, they will engage in the acts, practices, 
transactions, and courses of business set forth in th
is Complaint or in acts, practices, transactions, 
and courses of business of
 similar type and object. 
NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT 
10.The Commission brings this action pursuant
 to the authority conferred upon it by Exchange Act Section 21(d) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)
] and seeks a final judgment: (i) permanently 
enjoining Defendants from violating Exchange Act 
Section 10(b), pursuant to Exchange Act Section 
21(d)(1); (ii) ordering Defendants to disgorge 
the ill-gotten gains they received as a result of the 
violations alleged here and to pay prejudgment inte
rest thereon, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 
21(d)(5) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(5)]; (iii) ordering Defe
ndants to pay civil money penalties, pursuant to 
Exchange Act Section 21(d)(3) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d
)(3)]; (iv) permanently prohibiting Defendants 
from participating in any offering of a penny st
ock, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 21(d)(6) [15 
U.S.C. § 78u(d)(6)(A)]; and (v) ordering any othe
r relief the Court may deem just and appropriate. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
11.The Court has jurisdiction over this ac
tion pursuant to Exchange Act Section 27 
[15 U.S.C. §§ 78aa].  
12.Defendants have, directly or indirectly, ma
de use of the means or
 instrumentalities of 
interstate commerce or of the mails in connection 
with the transactions, acts, practices and courses 
of business alleged here. 
Case 2:18-cv-01317   Document 1   Filed 03/02/18   Page 3 of 17 PageID #: 3  4 13.Venue lies in the Eastern District of
 New York, pursuant to Exchange Act 
Section 27 [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], because certain of the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of 

business constituting viol
ations of the federal securities laws
 alleged in this Complaint occurred 
within the Eastern District of New York. Among other things, Defendants participated in telephone 
calls, e-mail exchanges, and text messages with the 
Undercover while he was in the Eastern District 
of New York.   
DEFENDANTS 
14.Beaufort is a U.K.-based brokerage firm. It is not registered with the Commission.  
15.Kyriacou
, age 26, is a U.K. citizen and resident. He is an investment manager at 
Beaufort. 
OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY 
16.HD View
 was incorporated in Florida in 2014. 
It purports to design and install 
closed-circuit television systems and to distribute 
network video recorders, high definition cameras, and accessories. Shares of its common stock are 
registered with the Commission under Exchange 
Act Section 12(g) and quoted on an OTC market under the ticker symbol ﬁHDVW.ﬂ  
FACTS 
17.In approximately October 2016, the Unde
rcover first cont
acted Kyriacou.  
18.Over the next approximately fifteen mont
hs, the Undercover repeatedly spoke with 
Kyriacou (and others at Beaufort) over the phone and in person and communicated with Kyriacou 
through email and WhatsApp, a text messaging app 
that uses the Internet to send and receive 
encrypted messages. In many or all of these phone calls, 
e-mails, and WhatsApp messages with 
Kyriacou, the Undercover participated from the Eastern District of New York.  
19.The Undercover presented himself as a U.S. citizen involved in the business of 
arranging pump-and-dump transactions in U.S. microcap securities
, as described further below.  Case 2:18-cv-01317   Document 1   Filed 03/02/18   Page 4 of 17 PageID #: 4  5 A.Beaufort Opens Brokerage A
ccounts for the Undercover.  
20.On November 30, 2016, the Undercover 
and an individual posing as the 
Undercover™s business associate (t
he ﬁBusiness Associateﬂ) traveled to the U.K. and met with 
Kyriacou and other Beaufort employees to open brokerage accounts at Beaufort.  
21.The Undercover described himself 
as ﬁbeing from New York.ﬂ   
22.The Undercover and the Business Associat
e told Kyriacou they were interested in 
opening six Beaufort brokerage accounts that day and four more accounts later, with each account 

in the name of a different nominee entity.  
23.The Undercover told Kyriacou that
, to avoid the Commission™s reporting 
requirements, the Undercover and the Business Asso
ciate wanted to split the stock they owned into 
multiple brokerage accounts so that no account he
ld 5% or more of the outstanding shares of a 
securities issuer. The Undercover made clear that
, although nominee entiti
es with nominee officers 
and directors would control the accounts on paper to conceal the Undercover™s and his associates™ 
identities and ownership of the stock, the Undercover would provide the trading instructions on all 
the accounts.
2    24.Over the course of the meeting, the Underc
over described his busi
ness as purchasing 
shell companies that traded ﬁover the counter–OT
C QBs.ﬂ He depicted his business as ﬁinvolved 
in the whole aspect of these firms from the creation–through to the liquidation.ﬂ  
25.The Undercover said that the companies™ 
stock started out as ﬁvery illiquidﬂ and then 
he ﬁput the management in placeﬂ for these comp
anies and directed the management to issue press 
releases of ﬁnews that™s not really newsﬂ at ﬁcertain points in time.ﬂ  
2  The Exchange Act requires individuals and entities to file a disclosure statement with the 
Commission after they acquire the beneficial owners
hip of more than 5% of a class of equity 
securities registered under Exchange Act Section 12.  
Case 2:18-cv-01317   Document 1   Filed 03/02/18   Page 5 of 17 PageID #: 5  6 26.Noting that he used ﬁfir
ms in the United Statesﬂ for publicity, the Undercover 
explained that ﬁ[w]e gotta pump it up–[bu
t] you don™t want eyes on the situation.ﬂ 
27.Kyriacou agreed: ﬁThat™s what we need. We
 need for these smaller cap companies, 
the problem is–when they initially raise money, the 
news flow goes dry after, and then the share 
price starts to trickle down–. You need constant news on these companies.ﬂ  
28.The Undercover told Kyriacou that he so
metimes placed matched trades to raise the 
stock price so that he could sell the stock at a profit: ﬁ[S]ometimes we need to
 trade [the stock] back 
and forth–do a matched trade here or there, so 
we can ratchet–you know bid the price up, to get 
it where we need it to be. Because–we have a hundre
d million shares of this shell and if we™re at a 
penny or ten cents or whatever, I me
an it™s a huge difference. The m
oney that could be made on it.ﬂ  
The Undercover explained that he hoped to make
 ﬁfive to ten million dollars on each of these 
deals.ﬂ  29.The Undercover eventually said he would ne
ed help from Beaufort to sell his shares 
and that he had a ﬁnetwork of brokersﬂ who woul
d buy the shares when the Undercover wanted to 
ﬁliquidateﬂ but that the ﬁtiming of the tradeﬂ would be ﬁcritical.ﬂ  
30.The Undercover later elaborated: ﬁ[W]e have
 firms in the U.S. and elsewhere that™ll 
be more than happy to, you know, put in some
 buys and sells and–get us–some liquidity.ﬂ  
31.At one point in the meeting, Kyriacou 
suggested that the Undercover speak to a 
Beaufort trader, whom Kyriacou described as
 someone who ﬁtrades–OTC stuff every single 
day–[and] deals directly with the–U.S.ﬂ 
32.Kyriacou later explained that Beaufort wo
uld charge the Undercover fees ﬁon a pay 
as you trade basisﬂ by charging a 1% commission on each trade.  
Case 2:18-cv-01317   Document 1   Filed 03/02/18   Page 6 of 17 PageID #: 6  7 33.At another point in the meeting, the UndercoverŠmaking clear he did not want his 
name listed in Beaufort™s account filesŠnoted that
 he was ﬁsomewhat hesita
ntﬂ to have his name 
ﬁsitting in a file–at Beaufort.ﬂ  
34.That day, Kyriacou helped the Undercover fill out account opening forms necessary 
to open six Beaufort brokerage accountsŠeach in th
e name of a different nominee entity and each 
with a different nominee director.  
35.In January 2017, at Kyriacou™s direction, Be
aufort opened six brokerage accounts for 
the Undercover.  
  36.A few months later, on April 26, 2017, Kyri
acou met the Undercover for lunch in 
the U.K.  
37.Kyriacou told the Undercover how to communicate with Beaufort concerning the 
brokerage accounts: ﬁAs far as we are concerned, to satisfy our compliance team, no one ever knows 

[your name], who [you] are, [y
our name] is a nobody–. [I]n term
s of the email correspondences, technically speaking you are not a client of 
ours–. You don™t know about those accounts.ﬂ 
38.Kyriacou then confirmed that the Unde
rcover should not call Kyriacou on his 
recorded office telephone line and 
should instead use WhatsApp.  
39.Kyriacou recommended that the Undercover set up a new email address for each of

want to setup an email address. 
Have that email address associated
 with those accounts. And give 
the orders from that ema

rcover told Kyriacou through WhatsApp 
that the Undercover, following Kyriacou™s advi
ce, had created six new email addressesŠone for 
each brokerage accountŠfrom which he would send Kyriacou trading instructions.   
B. Kyriacou Offers to Facilitate Manipulative Matched Trades.  
 41.In December 2017, at a dinner meeting in 
the U.K., Kyriacou and the Undercover 
first discussed a plan to trade HD View stock.  
42.The Undercover told Kyriacou: ﬁWhat I™d lik
e to do is like kind of prime the pump 
and just actually, we just want to show some
–there hasn™t been a lot of liquidity.ﬂ  
43.Kyriacou replied: ﬁYou need some vo
lume, obviously. You™d like to game the 
market.ﬂ  
44.The Undercover explained that the reason he needed to show that HD View was 
liquid ﬁbefore we kick off our big campaign,ﬂ was to provide a cover for the friendly brokers who 

planned to buy HD View stock during the pump and dump.  
45.The Undercover elaborated on his plan to 
engage in matched trades to create the 
false appearance that HD View stock was liquid:
 ﬁThe main thing is, I™m looking to create 
liquidity–. [W]e may need to like coordinate it with
 you, like when we™re going to do it. You know, 
do a match, do the match trade kind of thing, lik
e when you buy it, and I™ll make sure my guy on the 
sell side is there.ﬂ  
46.In response, Kyriacou explained that he
 had prior experience facilitating matched 
trades and explained how he and Beaufort would execute them: ﬁCrosses Œ broker to broker crosses. 

Say if you have your guy on the other side, who 
will match with us, we can match with him from our 
side–. You don™t want to lose the stock–. I do 
that with a lot of clients–. [T]hat™s standard 
practice every single day–. Stock x, leaves [your] account at Beaufort–you™re essentially buying and 

selling back to yourself, in theory.ﬂ

York, called Kyriacou from a cell phone.  
48.The Undercover told Kyriacou that th
e Undercover was working on the HD View 
deal but that HD View stock was not actively trad
ing: ﬁThe thing is–it™s very tight, we control the 
float, and we™re ready to–do a big campaign on th
is, but right now there™s really not–a lot of 
volume, so what I[™m] looking to do–is just do a small little trade just to show some volume.ﬂ   
49.Kyriacou reminded the Undercover: ﬁAs l
ong as they™re an au
thorized brokerage firm, we can–arrange a sort of broker to broker cross. Keep that in mind–where you can 

essentially sell from–over there to your account over here, or–vice versa. You sell to yourself 

basically, within the spread of course.ﬂ   
50.The Undercover continued: ﬁNow, that sounds like a really good way to go because 
you said it will print too, like it 
will show the volume and the price?ﬂ 
51.Kyriacou replied: ﬁYea, we always have to
 print. We always have to print to the 
market, to show the trade, so it shows volume, 
shows movement–. You™re going to be showing a 
trade there, you™re going to be showing a sell from brokerage X in New York to your Beaufort 

account in London.ﬂ  
52.Through WhatsApp, the Undercover later as
ked Kyriacou to place two orders, each 
to purchase $1,000 of HD View stock in the Underc
over™s Beaufort accounts, and represented to 
Kyriacou that the purchase orders
 would be matched by

"
141,141,"A former Merck & Co. Inc. employee who bought stock in a company that Merck was preparing to acquire in a tender offer agreed to pay a penalty equal to three times his illegal insider trading profits to settle an action by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

According to the SEC's complaint, on November 20, 2014 at 4:04 p.m., Yang Xie, then-Director of Global Health Outcomes Research for Merck, received an email from a Merck attorney discussing a contemplated merger between Merck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The email included an attachment advising recipients not to trade in Cubist's stock until a full trading date had elapsed after a public announcement of the acquisition. The complaint alleges that, approximately six minutes later, Xie replied to the e-mail and acknowledged receiving it. Approximately 14 minutes after he received the Merck attorney's email, Xie bought 80 shares of Cubist stock. On January 21, 2015, the date the tender offer was completed, Xie sold his Cubist stock and realized illegal profits of approximately 39%. During the SEC's investigation that followed, Xie allegedly denied learning about Merck's proposed acquisition of Cubist until the night before it was publicly announced.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges Xie with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and Exchange Act Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Xie has agreed to the entry of permanent injunctions as well as to pay disgorgement of $2,287, which represents Xie's trading profits, plus prejudgment interest and a $6,681 civil penalty of three times his trading profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The investigation was conducted in the SEC's Home Office by Adam Eisner and Keith O'Donnell and supervised by C. Joshua Felker, Stephan Schlegelmilch, and Melissa Hodgman. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the SEC's Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","                                              Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 1 of 10 PageID: 1

EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, Civil Action No. YANG XIE, v. COMPLAINT  
Defendant. Plaintiff United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC, 20549, for its Com
plaint against Defendant Yang Xie, 280 Wukang 
Road, 4-201, Shanghai, China, for insider trading, alleges as follows: SUMMARY 1. On November 20, 2014, Defendant Yang Xie, then an employee of Merck & Co., Inc. (ﬁMerckﬂ), was sent an email with attached documents from an attorney in Merck™s Office of 
General Counsel. One of the attachments contained ﬁprivileged and confidentialﬂ information that 
ﬁMerck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (‚Cubist™) are in discussions regarding a contemplated 
1               Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 2 of 10 PageID: 2 
strategic transactionﬂ that ﬁis likely to be consid
ered material to Cubist.ﬂ The email attachment 
further advised that, pursuant to Merck™s corpora
te insider trading policy, ﬁ[y]ou may not purchase, 
sell or otherwise engage in any trading of Cubist™s stock until a full trading day has elapsed after a public announcement of the Transaction.ﬂ 
2. Within approximately 14 minutes after bein
g sent the email, Xie purchased 80 shares 
of Cubist stock in his personal brokerage account at a price of $73.39 per share. 
3. On December 8, 2014, Merck publicly annou
nced its intention to acquire Cubist for $102 per share in cash (39% premium to Xie™s purchase price) via a tender offer, which was 
completed on January 21, 2015. 
4. Xie sold his Cubist stock on January 21, 2015, for a profit of approximately $2,287. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21A and 27 
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u-1 and 78aa
]. The Defendant, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the mails in connection with 
the conduct alleged herein. 6. Venue in this judicial district is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the acts, transacti
ons, practices, and courses of business 
constituting the violations alleged herein occurred 
within this judicial district in that: Xie was a 
resident of Bridgewater, New Jersey during the period
 at issue; Xie worked for Merck from an office 
within New Jersey during the period at issue; and Xie placed his order to buy the securities at issue 
via a device connected to the Internet while located in his office at Merck within New Jersey. 
DEFENDANT 7. Yang Xie (Xie), age 38, is a citizen of 
China who resided in Bridgewater, New Jersey 
under a U.S. work visa from approx
imately December 2010 to May 2016. 
2            Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 3 of 10 PageID: 3 
8. During this period, and until approximately October 2016, Xie worked for a 
subsidiary of Merck. Xie held the title of Director of Global Health Outcomes Research at Merck™s 
Center for Observational and Real World Evidence, a unit within Merck™s Research & Development 

division that did observational research and comparative effectiveness research to assess the value of 

medical interventions relative to alter
natives in ﬁreal worldﬂ settings.  
OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES 9. Merck, a New Jersey corporation, is a globa
l health care company headquartered in 
Kenilworth, N.J. Merck™s common stock is re
gistered with the Commission and Merck files periodic reports with the Commission. Merck™s stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 10. Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cubist), until approximately January 2015, was a Delaware corporation in the pharmaceuticals ind
ustry headquartered in Lexington, MA. Cubist™s 
stock was registered with the Commission and Cubi
st filed periodic reports with the Commission. Cubist™s stock was quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On January 21, 2015, Merck 

completed a successful tender offer for all the ou
tstanding shares of Cubist™s stock and acquired Cubist through a merger of Merck™s wholly
 owned subsidiary with and into Cubist. FACTS 11. As an expert in health outcomes research, 
part of Xie™s job at Merck was to assess 
the value and cost effectiveness of drugs Merck was marketing, developing, or that Merck was 
considering acquiring. Xie specialized in evaluating
 antibacterial and antifungal drugs for treatment of certain infectious diseases. Xie often contributed his health outcomes research to colleagues at 
Merck who advised the company on new product launches and proposed acquisitions. 12. Prior to 2015, one of Merck™s main competitors developing infectious disease drugs was the pharmaceutical company Cubist.

13. In 2014, Merck considered acquiring Cubist. To ensure confidentiality of the deliberations, Merck™s contemplated acquisition of 
Cubist was given the internal code name ﬁProject 
Pablo.ﬂ In early to mid-2014, Xie analyzed in
formation that was marked ﬁconfidentialﬂ about 
Cubist™s products from a health outcomes perspective. 14. On July 2, 2014, the Project Pablo team ultimately concluded their review of Cubist 
by ﬁrecommending at this time not to pursue this acquisition.ﬂ 
15. At or around September and October, 2014, Merck decided nonetheless to pursue 
an acquisition of Cubist. At about the same time, Merck retained legal counsel and an investment 
banking firm for the purpose of pursuing the acquisition of Cubist. 
16. On approximately October 7, Merck™s CEO approached Cubist™s CEO to broach the idea of Merck acquiring Cubist. Confidential 
negotiations began shortly thereafter, and Merck 
changed the internal code name for the acquisition from ﬁProject Pabloﬂ to ﬁProject Diego.ﬂ 17. On approximately November 10, Merck™s CEO informed Cubist™s CEO that Merck was prepared to make a non-binding, all-cash tender 
offer to acquire all outstanding Cubist stock for 
$102 per share, a significant premium to the pri
ce of Cubist™s stock at that time quoted on the 
NASDAQ. Insider Trading in Conn
ection with Merck™s Tender Offer for Cubist 
18. At approximately 4:04 p.m. 
on November 20, 2014, an attorney in Merck™s Office of 
General Counsel sent a group email message to a
pproximately 60 Merck employees, including Xie, 
with the subject line ﬁPROJECT DIEGO (f/k/a PABL
O).ﬂ The email included two attachments, one 
of which was entitled ﬁDiego No Trading Memo.ﬂ 
19. The ﬁDiego No Trading Memoﬂ attachment specifically warned: 
Merck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ﬁCubistﬂ) are in discussions regarding a contemplated strategic transaction (the ﬁTransactionﬂ). 

The Transaction is likely to be considered material to Cubist. As 

such, we would like to remind you of the insider trading and 4               Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 5 of 10 PageID: 5 
confidentiality obligations that apply to you with respect to the 
Transaction. You may not purchase, sell or otherwise engage in any trading of 
Cubist™s stock until a full trading day has elapsed after a public 
announcement of the Transaction.... Please see Merck™s Corporate 

Policy #30 on Insider Trading for additional information. This matter remains extremely confidential. We ask that you continue 
to restrict information about the 
potential Cubist Transaction to only 
those who have an absolute need 
to know as Merck has certain 
confidentiality obligations to Cubist..... 20. The body of the email asked recipients to 
ﬁread the attached memorandum regarding Project Diego (f/k/a Pablo)ﬂ and to respond acknow
ledging that they have read and understood the 
memo. The body of the email also asked the recipients to identify other people not already included 
on the distribution ﬁwho are aware of the deal.ﬂ 
21. Xie replied to the email six minutes later, at approximately 4:10 p.m., acknowledging 
his receipt of the email. Xie™s reply stated in full: ﬁI am on your distribution list so I got the email, but I™m not on the list in your word document. I don™t 
know if should be on your list or not as this is my first time hearing about Project DIEGO. But judging from the other people on the list I might be. Can you check and let me know? Thanks!ﬂ 
22. Approximately eight minutes later, at 4:18 
p.m., Xie placed an order to buy 80 shares 
of Cubist stock. His order was filled almost immediately at a cost of $73.39 per share. 
23. At approximately 7:00 a.m. on December 
8, 2014, 19 days after Xie bought Cubist stock, Merck and Cubist made their first public announcements of the deal. According to the 

announcement, Merck and Cubist entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck would 
engage in a tender offer to acquire Cubist for $1
02 per share in cash, representing a premium of $28.61 (39%) to Xie™s cost basis in Cubist stock. 24. On January 21, 2015, Merck announced the successful completion of the tender offer at a purchase price of $102. 5                   Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 6 of 10 PageID: 6 
25. Xie sold his 80 shares of Cubist stock on January 21 at $101.98, for proceeds, 
excluding commissions, of $8,158.40. Thus, Xie realized profits of $
2,287.20
. 26. During the Commission staff™s investigation, Xie denied learning about Merck™s 
proposed acquisition of Cubist until the night before it was publicly announced. 
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Violations of Section 10(b) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 27. Paragraphs 1 through 26 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference. 28. As an express condition of his employment, Defendant Xie owed a fiduciary or similar duty of trust and confidence to Merck and its shareholders, including the duty to keep 
nonpublic information obtained in the course of his employment confidential and to not use such information for his personal benefit. 29. Xie acted at least recklessly in failing to
 know that the email he was sent on November 20, 2014, contained information concerni
ng Merck™s tender offer to acquire Cubist that 
was confidential and that he was not permitted to tr
ade Cubist securities until after this information was disclosed publicly. 30. By reason of the conduct described above, Defendant Yang Xie, acting at least 
recklessly, by use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in 
connection with the purchase or sale of
 securities, directly or indirectly: (a) employed devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; and/or 
(b) engaged in acts, practices, or courses of business which operate or would 
operate as a fraud or deceit upon any persons, including purchases or sellers of the Cubist™s 
securities. SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
Violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 Thereunder 31. Paragraphs 1 through 30 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference. 6          Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 7 of 10 PageID: 7 
32. By November 20, 2014, the date of Xie™s purc
hase of Cubist securities alleged herein, 
substantial steps had been taken to commence Merc
k™s tender offer to acquire Cubist, including: 
both companies hiring legal counsel and investment banking advisors, negotiations between senior 
officers of Merck and Cubist, and the companies reac
hing a tentative agreement about the terms of a 
tender offer. 33. On November 20, 2014, Defendant Xie purchased the securities to be sought by the 
tender offer while in possession of material informat
ion relating to such tender offer, which he at least had reason to know was nonpublic information, and which he at least had reason to know had been acquired from a representative acting 
on behalf of Merck, the offering company. 7

Washington, DC 20549 
10 "
142,142,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled action in federal court against the perpetrators of a multi-million dollar fraudulent offering of unregistered securities for a Southern California-based home audio manufacturer.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Dedicated Sound and Audio, Inc. (""DSA""), located in Lake Forest, California, and Steven Ventre, its founder, president, and CEO, retained the services of Choice Equity, a telemarketer controlled by recidivist Eric Lovy (formerly known as Eric Beltran), to solicit investors on DSA's behalf. The SEC alleges that investors in the unregistered offering were falsely told in a private placement memorandum drafted by Ventre and Lovy that DSA would pay no more than 15% of the amount raised in sales commissions to registered broker-dealers. In reality, over a 20-month span, DSA paid more than 33% ($1.56 million of $4.6 million) of the amount raised to Choice Equity and Lovy, neither of whom is registered with the SEC. More than half of the commissions went directly to Lovy.

The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges DSA and Ventre with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, charges Ventre with liability as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for DSA's liability under Section 10(b). The complaint further charges Lovy with aiding and abetting DSA's and Ventre's violations of these antifraud provisions. In addition, the SEC charges all of the defendants with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and both Lovy and Choice Equity with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

The defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws; imposing civil penalties against each of them; and ordering Lovy and Choice Equity to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of the collective $1.56 million in commissions that they received from DSA, and civil penalties of $160,000 and $870,850, respectively. DSA and Ventre agreed to pay penalties of $250,000 and $80,000, respectively.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Peter Del Greco and supervised by Marc Blau, of the Los Angeles office, with the assistance of trial attorney David Van Havermaat.","  COMPLAINT

 4. This matter involves
 a 
multi
-million dollar 
fraudulent and unregistered 
securities offering conducted by
 Dedicated Sound and Audio, Inc. (ﬁDSAﬂ), its founder, 
president
, and CEO, S
teven Ventre
 (ﬁVentreﬂ)
, Eric Lovy
, formerly known as Eric 
Beltran (ﬁLovyﬂ)
, and Choice Equity, a 
telemarke
ting 
company 
that Lovy 
solely 
control
led
 and used to solicit investors
 in DSA
.  Defendants represented to investors 
that they would pay sales 
commissions of no more than 15%, and retain only
 licensed 
broker dealers.  In reality, 
defendants
 paid over 
a 
third of the funds they raised
Šor 
33.5%
Što an unlicensed telemarketing firm
, which
 cold
-called investors off of lead 
lists
, with more than half the commissions going directly to Lovy
. 5. From 
January 
2013 to September 2014, 
the defendants
 raised 
more than 
$4.6 million 
from 
more than 85 
investors
 through
 an unregistered
 offer and sale of 
DSA™s
 securities
, most of which were offered and sold by Choice Equity.  
 6. Ventre and 
Lovy collaborated to 
draft and disseminate 
a private placement 
memorandum (ﬁPPMﬂ) that expr
essly and falsely stated that 
DSA would pay no more 
than a 15% sales commission to ﬁlicensed broker/dealers and other qualified 
personnel.ﬂ 
 7. DSA 
actually 
paid $1.56 million of the amount raised
, or roughly 33.5%,

provisions of

 Exchange 
Act

der
, and Lovy aided and abetted those violations
.  In 
addition, each of the defendants 
violated the securities registration provisions of 
Section
s 5(a) and 5(c)
 of the Securities 
Act.  
Lovy and Choice Equity 
also
 violated the 
broker

 11. Steven Ventre
, age 52, is a 
resident of Lake Forest, California.  Ventre 
founded DSA and has been its president and CEO since sometime between September 
2012 and 2013.  He is not register

September 2012 and located in Lake Forest, California.   
 13. Eric Lovy f
/k/a Eric Beltran
, age 45
, is a resident of 
Huntington Beach, 
California.  
Lovy solely controls Choice Equity and is the sole signatory on its bank 
accounts.  
He is not registered

registered broker
-dealer.  In 2002, the California Department of Corporations issued a 
Desist
-and
-Refrain Order against 
Lovy
 (then known as Eric Beltran) 
for conducting a 
general solicitation of the unregistered securities of 
an issuer

Lovy changed his 
name after the issuance of the Desist
-and
-Refrain Order against 
him.

2014, consented to an order by the California Department 
of Business Oversight that he desist and refrain from offering, selling, effecting any 
transaction in
, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchas
e or sale of any security, 
in California, and further agreed to disgorge $15,250 in ill
-gotten profits.
 14. Choice Equity
 is a Wyoming company 
located in Cheyenne, Wyoming 
and controlled by Lovy
.  Choice Equity has never been registered with the 
SEC
 in any 
cap
acity.
 THE ALLEGATIONS
 A. The Defendants™ Fraudulent Offer and Sale of DSA Securities
 15. Ventre formed 
DSA 
in 2012 
to manufacture three product lines: flat panel 
loudspeakers, home audio speakers with artwork facades suitable for framing, and 
removable phone
-case speaker phones.  Due to economic constraints, 
DSA 
quickly
 focused most of its attention on the home audio speakers, which were promoted under 
the name ﬁSound Art.ﬂ
 16. Ventre was responsible for the day
-to-day operations of DSA and he 
exercised
 sole
 contr
ol over DSA™s bank accounts
, as the only person with signatory 
authority.
 17. In January 2013, DSA commenced the offer and sale of up to $5 million of 
its Series A Preferred Stock
 (ﬁPreferred Stockﬂ)
.  Although Ventre personally contacted 
several investors wit
h whom he had a prior relationship, most of the offering was 
conducted by Choice Equity, 
with 
which 
DSA contracted to cold
-call
 potential 
investors across the United States
 from telemarketing centers in s
outhern California. 
 18. In the course of soliciting inv
estments from residents of multiple states, 
Choice Equity 
sent DSA™s PPM to investors and potential investors via the U.S. mails.
  19. The creation of DSA™s PPM was a collaborative effort between Lovy and 
Ventre.  Both men played a substantial role in its drafting.  
Ventre and Lovy both 
reviewed, commented upon, and had their comments imp
lemented in drafts of DSA™s 
PPM
. Case 8:18-cv-00323   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   Page 4 of 14   Page ID #:4  COMPLAINT
 5   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  20. The PPM used 
in co
nnection with the offering of DSA™s Preferred Stock
 co
ntained the following representation:
 A 15% sales commission will be paid to participating
 (FINRA) licensed broker/dealers and other qualified
 Personnel.  See ‚Use of Proceeds.™
  21. The PPM™s ‚Use of 
Proceeds™ section attributed up to $750,000 of the $5 
million in offering proceeds to ﬁSelling Expensesﬂ and contained a footnote that stated:
 Sales commissions to not exceed 15% may be paid to
 registered broker/dealers or other qualified individuals.
  22. Thr
ough September 2014, DSA raised more than $4.6 million from more 
than 85 investors
 in at least 19 states
, primarily through the sale of its Preferred Stock 
and also through the issuance of promissory notes, almost all of which were convertible, 
and most of
 which were in fact converted, into Preferred Stock.
 23. During that same period, 
Ventre caused DSA to pay
 Choice Equity $1.56 
million, or roughly 33.5% of the amount that was raised from its sale of DSA™s 
securities.  Choice Equity remitted $870,850 of that a
mount to Lovy.
 24. DSA™s PPM contained two material misrepresentations:  First, DSA paid 
Choice Equity a sales commission of more than 33%, not 15%
 as represented in the 
PPM
.  Second, 
contrary to the representations in the PPM, 
neither Choice Equity nor 
Lovy w
ere registered broker
-dealers, and neither Lovy nor any of Choice Equity™s 
employees were associated with a registered broker
-dealer
.    25. The defendants™ misrepresentations were material, as they were central 
to investor™s decisions to invest, and to their 
decisions to keep their money invested 
in DSA.  
Investors would
 have considered it important to
 their investment decision to 
know that Ventr
e and DSA 
were paying more in sales commissions than had been 
represented to investors, and that defendants
™ sales a
gents lacked the qualifications or 
licensing that the PPM described.
 26. Ventre 
and DSA
 acted with scienter.  Ventre and DSA 
knew, or 
were Case 8:18-cv-00323   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   Page 5 of 14   Page ID #:5  COMPLAINT
 6   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  reckless in not knowing, that the representations contained in the PPM 
concerning the 
size of the sales commissions and t
he qualifications of the individuals offering and 
selling 
DSA securities
 were 
materially 
false and misleading
. 27.  In 
addition
, Ventre and DSA 
failed to exercise reasonable care
 by making 
materially misleading representations about 
the size of the sales commi
ssions and the 
qualifications of the individuals offering and selling DSA securities
. B. DSA and Ventre Obtained Money By Means of the Fraud
 28. Ventre and DSA received money by means of the materially false 
statements alleged above in the offer and sale of DS
A securities.
 29. DSA received money from investors through the sale of its securities.
 30. Ventre personally profited from the defendants™ fraudulent conduct. 
During the relevant period, checks of more than $55,000 payable to Ventre and checks 
of more than $87,000 payable to cash were drawn on DSA accounts, and more than 
$115,000 was transferred
 from DSA™s accounts to Ventre™s accounts.  During the same  
period, almost $100,000 was withdrawn from DSA™s accounts in cash.  Moreover, 
DSA™s accounts reflected more than $700,000 in debit card purchases
, many of which 
were for fast food, gasoline, and 
other items of a personal, rather than business, nature.
 C. Lovy Aided and Abetted DSA™s and Ventre™s Antifraud Violations
 31. Lovy knew, or was reckless in not knowing
, that his role
 was part 
of 
DSA™s and Ventre™s
 improper activity.
   Lovy co
-drafted DSA™s PP
M with Ventr
e, knowing that he would disseminate the PPM to investors.  Lovy received commissions 
that he knew or was reckless in not knowing exceeded the amount disclosed in the 
PPM.  He also knew or was reckless in not knowing that the PPM™s description 
of the 
sales agents™ licensing and qualifications were materially misleading.
 32. As the conduit through which most of DSA™s securities were offered and 
sold to the public, and through which DSA™s PPM was disseminated to investors and 
potential investors, Lovy

145,145,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an enforcement action against an Atlanta-area resident who allegedly misused more than $1.2 million in investments intended to support national security-related businesses and the development of a high-performance submarine vessel.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Timothy S. Batchelor misspent approximately half of the $2.4 million he raised from a handful of investors through an investment fund called Specter Ventures Fund II. For example, Batchelor allegedly used nearly a quarter-million dollars in investor funds to purchase new vehicles and approximately $225,000 to pay student loans. Batchelor also allegedly transferred thousands of dollars in investor funds to other family members.

According to the SEC's complaint, Batchelor later tried to cover his tracks by belatedly fabricating a document in November 2015 describing the unauthorized expenditures as a ""loan"" taken in February 2015.

The SEC's complaint also alleges that Batchelor was not registered with the SEC in any capacity at the time he raised funds through Specter. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Batchelor violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint seeks disgorgement plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctions against Batchelor.

The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Robert Schroeder."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIAATLANTA DIVISIONSECURITIES AND EXCHANGECOMMISSION,Plaintiff,v.TIMOTHY S.

Between January 2015 and July 2015, three high net-worthindividuals and one institutional investor invested $2.4 million into SpecterVentures Fund. Each investor was provided with a subscription agreement andprivate placement agreement (""PPM"") that was drafted primarily based uponinformation provided by Batchelor.16. The offering materials for Specter Ventures Fund and otherinformation provided to investors represented that investor funds would be used toinvest in various businesses related to national security, as well as thedevelopment of a high performance submarine vessel.DCase 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 6 of 20 
 17. In addition to describing Specter Ventures Fund's investmentobjectives, the PPM noted that Specter Ventures Manager would receive a 2%yearly fee, based on the net assets of Specter Ventures Fund, as well as 20% of thefund's gains.18. The PPM also noted that Specter Ventures Fund would pay expensesdirectly related to Specter Ventures Manager's operation of the fund, including,among other categories, operating, research, administrative, travel and marketingexpenses.19. The PPM also stated that ""[c]ertain of the funds to be paid related toFund Expenses, transactions and organization expenses incurred by or on behalf ofthe Fund maybe paid to one or more affiliates of the Manager ... for servicesprovided to the Fund.... [I]t is expected that such fees will be paid according tothe usual and customary industry standards ....""20. In response to an investor question about whether salaries were paidto Specter Ventures Manager's personnel, and based upon information receivedfrom Batchelor, an associate of Batchelor's stated in an e-mail that:""[Specter Ventures Fund] will require the professional services ofcertain independent service providers for investor protection.Examples of this include, but are not limited to, [Specter Ventures7Case 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 7 of 20

Specter Ventures Fund Files a Form D Containing False and MateriallyMisleading Statements21. On March 2, 2015, Specter Ventures Fund filed a Form D with theCommission, to report its reliance on the exemption from the securitiesregistration provisions provided by Rule 506(b) of Regulation D.22. Batchelor provided all of the information that was incorporated intothe Form D.23. The Form D contained several false and misleading statements.24. First, the Form D indicated that the total amount of interests in theSpecter Ventures Fund sold between February 16, 2015 and March 2, 2015, was$70 million, when in fact only $900,000 had been sold during that period.Case 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 8 of 20 
 25. Second, the Form D failed to disclose that substantial amounts ofinvestor funds had already been moved to Batchelor's personal bank accounts andspent on personal goods and services. Instead, the Form D falsely stated that that
no amount of the gross proceeds from the offering were used as payments toBatchelor or others associated with Specter Ventures Fund.26. After filing, the Form D was provided to prospective investors in theSpecter Ventures Fund.C. Batchelor's Misappropriation of Investor Funds27. Through a series of transfers and withdrawals directed by Batchelor,Batchelor misappropriated approximately $1.2 million of the $2.4 million raisedfrom investors for his personal use and other wholly unrelated, unauthorizedexpenses.28. Examples of Batchelor's personal expenses include the following: (a)approximately $233,000 for new vehicle purchases; (b) approximately $225,000for student loans; (c) approximately $29,000 for classes at Georgetown University;(d) $44,000 transferred to his mother; (e) approximately $80,000 transferred to hiswife; and (~ $25,000 for luxury watches.Case 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 9 of 20 
 29. Batchelor also withdrew approximately $172,000 in cash or cashier'schecks, for which the ultimate use is unknown.30. Batchelor also made check card purchases that were personal innature, including more than $2,000 at Brooks Brothers, and more than $3,000 at aretailer that carries leather handbags and goods.D. Batchelor Belatedly Mischaracterizes the Misappropriated Funds as a""Loan""31. In November 2015, Batchelor caused Specter Ventures Manager tosend a letter to investors that misrepresented his use of investors' funds as a loan.32. The letter specifically stated that an entity owned and controlled byBatchelor and an associate had ""borrowed"" $2.4 million from investors inFebruary 2015.33. All information and supporting documentation concerning thepurported loan was provided by Batchelor to outside counsel for Specter VenturesFund, who then drafted the letter to be sent to investors.34. The purported loan document was fabricated by Batchelor in anattempt to justify and conceal his earlier fraud.10Case 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 10 of 20

146,146,"Feb. 12, 2018 - Two former executives of a medical products distributor have agreed to settle charges that they illegally traded on inside information in the securities of Emeritus Corp.

According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Todd M. LaVelle, the former chief executive officer and a board member of In Home Medical Solutions, LLC (IHMS) and Ara Chackerian, a former officer and board member of IHMS, both learned of an impending merger between Emeritus and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. from IHMS' Chief Operating Officer. The merger potentially had significant business implications for IHMS because a subsidiary of Emeritus was IHMS' largest customer. Before the merger was publicly announced, LaVelle and Chackerian bought Emeritus securities and each sold them for illegal profits of over $25,000 and $157,000, respectively, the day after the merger announcement.

The SEC's complaint against LaVelle, filed on February 8, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, LaVelle agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $25,342.40 in disgorgement, $2,629.81 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,342.40. The settlement is pending court approval.

The SEC's order against Chackerian finds that he violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Chackerian consented to a cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $157,207.80, prejudgment interest of $18,635.55, and a civil penalty of $157,207.80.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Greg Hillson and Jason Litow and supervised by Antonia Chion and Yuri B. Zelinsky. Daniel Maher provided litigation advice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA JACKSONVILLE DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, v. ~ASE NO.: ll""'\ 1 ~/!A r::,Ł. li-OJ-~-v-~ .

 3. Beginning in or about September 2013, Emeritus senior management engaged in highly confidential merger negotiations with Brookdale senior management. In or about late December 2013 or early January 2014, a senior officer of Emeritus Subsidiary, who was aware of the merger negotiations, provided confidential information about the impending merger to In Home Medical's chief operating officer ( .. COO""). Because the impending merger potentially had significant business implications for In Home Medical, which obtained over thirty percent of its revenue from sales to Emeritus Subsidiary, In Home Medical's COO relayed the news to La Velie. 4. After learning of the potential merger from In Home Medical's COO, La Velie purchased Emeritus securities in advance of the merger's public announcement. By purchasing Emeritus securities while aware of material nonpublic information concerning the impending Emeritus merger, La Veile misappropriated the information and converted it to his personal use and profit, thereby breaching the duties that he owed to In Home Medical. 5. After the merger was publicly announced on February 20, 2014, the price of Emeritus stock increased by over thirty-six percent. La Yelle sold his securities on the day after the announcement, realizing a profit of approximately $25,342. 6. By engaging in the conduct described above, and as described more fully below, La Yelle violated Section IO(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b] and Rule l0b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.IOb-5]. 2 Case 3:18-cv-00226-HES-MCR Document 1 Filed 02/08/18 Page 2 of 9 PageID 2 
 7. The Commission requests the Court to enter a final judgment (I) permanently restraining and enjoining La Velle from future violations of Section 1 O(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule I Ob-5 thereunder, by engaging in illegal insider trading or tipping, and (2) ordering LaVelle to disgorge his trading profits from trading in Emeritus securities, with prejudgment interest; and (3) ordering LaVelle to pay a civil monetary penalty. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21 ( d), 21 ( e 
), 21A, and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and (e), 78u-1 and 78aa]. 9. Venue is proper under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [IS U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain acts or transactions constituting the violations occurred in this district. For example, In Home Medical's principal place of business was in Jacksonville, Florida, and, as detailed below, certain relevant calls and meetings took place in this district. I 0. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, La Velle, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instruments ofinterstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein. DEFENDANT 11. Defendant Todd La Yelle, 50, resides in Marietta, Georgia, and was at all relevant times the CEO and a board member of In Home Medical. RELEVANT ENTITIES 12. Brookdale Senior Living Inc., an operator of senior living communities, is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Brentwood, Tennessee. Brookdale 3 Case 3:18-cv-00226-HES-MCR Document 1 Filed 02/08/18 Page 3 of 9 PageID 3 
 common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""BKD."" On July 31, 2014, Brookdale acquired Emeritus pursuant to a merger agreement that was publicly announced on February 20, 2014. 13. Emeritus Corporation, a senior living service provider, was a Washington corporation with its principal place of business in Seattle, Washington. Emeritus's common _stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section l 2{b) of the Exchange Act and was traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ESC."" Emeritus Subsidiary, a home healthcare provider, was an operating unit of Emeritus until Emeritus was acquired by Brookdale on July 31, 2014. 14. In Home Medical Solutions, LLC, a medical product distribution company, was a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Jacksonville, Florida. FACTS 15. Beginning in September 2013, Brookdale and Emeritus executives conducted 
highly confidential and nonpublic negotiations regarding a potential acquisition of Emeritus by Brookdale. In or around November 2013, a senior officer of Emeritus Subsidiary (""Emeritus Subsidiary Executive"") signed a confidentiality agreement with Emeritus concerning the proposed transaction between Brookdale and Emeritus and was made aware of the highly confidential merger discussions that were under way at that time. On or about December 22, 2013, Emeritus's board authorized management to negotiate a transaction with Brookdale on an exclusive basis. 4 Case 3:18-cv-00226-HES-MCR Document 1 Filed 02/08/18 Page 4 of 9 PageID 4 
 16. In late December 2013 or early January 2014, Emeritus Subsidiary Executive told In Home Medical's COO about the impending merger between Emeritus and Brookdale. Because the impending merger potentially had significant business implications for In Home Medical, which obtained over thirty percent of its revenue from sales to Emeritus Subsidiary, In Home Medical's COO relayed the news to La Yelle. In Home Medical's COO believed that, if the merger occurred, Emeritus Subsidiary might expand into new markets and purchase more medical supplies from In Home Medical. In Home Medical' s COO asked La Veile to keep the 
information confidential and not to purchase Emeritus shares, and LaVelle agreed. Based on information and belief, In Home Medical's COO conveyed this information while in this district. 17. In Home Medical' s board often discussed confidential information during its meetings. During at least one call among members ofln Home Medical's board in January 2014, the members and In Home Medical's COO discussed the potential business implications for In Home Medical of the potential merger. 18. The information concerning the potential merger was confidential and significant to In Home Medical, and the disclosure or misuse of the information by In Home Medical had the potential to harm In Home Medical's relationship and reputation with Emeritus Subsidiary, which was In Home Medical's largest customer. 19. As a member of In Home Medical' s board and as In Home Medical' s CEO, La Veile owed a duty to In Home Medical to maintain the information in confidence and refrain from trading on it. 5 Case 3:18-cv-00226-HES-MCR Document 1 Filed 02/08/18 Page 5 of 9 PageID 5 
 20. On or about January 20, 2014, based on the infonnation that he had learned about the merger as CEO and board member ofln Home Medical, La Velie placed an order to purchase 3,500 shares of Emeritus stock for approximately $77,000. La Veile did not disclose his purchase of Emeritus securities to anyone at In Home Medical. 21. La Velie knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, that the infonnation he received from In Home Medical's COO regarding the potential merger was material nonpublic information. 22. La Veile also knew, or was severely reckless in not knowing, that the infonnation he received from In Home Medical' s COO regarding the potential merger was conveyed to him in his capacity as an officer and board member of In Home Medical, was intended to be used to evaluate In Home Medical's future business prospects, was confidential to In Home Medical, and was not intended for him to use for his personal purpose or benefit. 23. In trading based on the material nonpublic information he received about the potential Emeritus merger, La Veile misappropriated information entrusted to him as CEO and a board member of In Home Medical, thereby breaching his duty to In Home Medical. 24. Due diligence and negotiations between Brookdale and Emeritus continued through February 2014, and culminated in a final merger agreement that Brookdale and Emeritus jointly announced on February 20, 2014. 25. On February 21, 2014, shares in Emeritus began trading approximately thirty-seven percent over the previous day's closing price. 6 Case 3:18-cv-00226-HES-MCR Document 1 Filed 02/08/18 Page 6 of 9 PageID 6 
 26. On February 21, 2014, LaVelle sold his shares in Emeritus, realizing a profit of approximately $25,342. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNTl Todd La Velie Violated Section lO(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5 Thereunder 27. The Commission repeats and re-alleges Paragraphs 1 through 26 of the Complaint. 28. Defendant engaged in an illegal insider trading scheme in which, in breach of a fiduciary duty and duties of trust or confidence that he owed to In Home Medical and its members, he knowingly, or with severe recklessness, misappropriated material, nonpublic information and used it to purchase and sell securities. 29. By engaging in the conduct described above, Defendant, directly and indirectly, by use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, in connection with

147,147,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") filed an enforcement action on January 31, 2018, in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, charging two Boston-area investment advisers with defrauding multiple clients by stealing nearly half a million dollars of client assets, along with other breaches of their fiduciary duty. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced criminal charges against Polese and Peterson.

According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in 2014, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson, while employed as investment advisers at a large financial institution, engaged in various schemes to defraud their clients, including stealing nearly $450,000 from one elderly client. In March 2016, Polese and Peterson fraudulently misappropriated $350,000 of their client's money, using $100,000 of those funds to make investments in their own names, and directing the remaining $250,000 to Polese's personal bank account. Then, from March through May of 2017, Polese made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the same client's account totaling approximately $93,000 to pay Polese's credit card and college tuition expenses for Polese's children.

In addition to stealing client funds, the complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson breached their fiduciary duty to their clients when they (1) secretly put client funds at risk by using a client's assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a private entity in which Polese and Peterson were investors, and (2) invested client funds into an investment in which defendants held a financial interest, without informing the client or disclosing their conflict of interest. Additionally, Polese defrauded two clients through violations of his fiduciary duties to those clients including (1) obtaining a loan from a client on unfavorable terms to the client; and (2) charging a client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate he repeatedly promised to charge her.

The Commission's complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"") and that they aided and abetted violations of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Polese and Peterson.

The Commission's investigation was conducted by Andrew H. Feller, Eric M. Brooks, and Kevin B. Currid of the Boston Regional Office. The Commission's litigation will be led by Martin F. Healey. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the FBI."," UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 2 of 11 3FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
7.Beginningin 2014, Polese and Peterson en
gaged in at least three separate 
schemes to misappropriate and misuse assets of two of thei
r clients (ﬁClient 
Aﬂ and ﬁClient Bﬂ) 
in order to support their outside business intere
sts and to pay their own personal expenses.  In
each instance, Polese and Peterson exploited their fiduciary relationship with an advisory client, 

and engaged in deceptive conduct in
 order to obscure their conduct.
8.Petersonbegan serving as an investment 
advisor to Client A in 2012 when Client Amoved his assets to the Financial Institution™s Boston office, giving Peterson full discretionary 

authority over his account.  When opening a ne
w account at the Financial Institution, Client A 
informed Peterson that he had a moderate risk to
lerance for investments and was not interested in 
speculative investments.  
9.Client B is in his mid-80s,has been a client with the Financial Institution since the 
1980s,and was a client of Polese™s for the last 8y
ears.  Client B is a retired businessman who 
had informed Polese and Peterson 
of his desire to giveawaysubs
tantially all of his assetsto 
charity.Client Breliedon Defendants to recomm
end investments and update him on the status of 
his portfolio.Peterson Violates His Fiduciary Duty to 
Client Awith an Unau
thorized Investment
10.In 2014, while working at the Financial 
Institution, Peterson be
came adirector of 
anon-Financial Institution private fund (ﬁFund Aﬂ).
  Fund A was an investment vehicle through 
which an acquaintance of Peterson was raisin
g money fora wind-farm investment.  The 
Financial Institution™s policies required employees like Peterson to disclose outside business 

activities to the Financial Institution and to obtain approval from the Financial Institution before 

engaging in such activities.  
Peterson disclosed his position as a director of Fund A to the 
Financial Institutionin December 2014.As a conditi
on of obtaining the Financial Institution™s 
approval to participate in this outside business activity, Peterson falsely represented to the 

Financial Institution that he would not actively solicit the Financial Institution™sclientsto invest 

in Fund A.In actuality, four months earlier 
Œin August 2014ŒPeterson had caused Client Ato 
Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 3 of 11 4invest $100,000 in thewind farm investment.Peter
son made further fals
e statements to the 
Financial Institution when he signed a form stating that Client A had verbally authorized the 

$100,000 investment.11.The wind farmwas analternative investme
nt that was not authorized by the 
Financial Institution andPeterson wastherefore prohibited from recommending itto clients.

Moreover, placing Client A in the wind farm inve
stment was contrary to 
the stated investment 
objectives and risk tolerance of the client, a
nd therefore represented a breachof Peterson™s 
fiduciary duty to Client A.
12.The wind-farm investment ultimately failed and Client A™sentire investment was 
lost.Peterson and Polese Risk $400,000 of Client 
B™s Money and Cause Him to Incur $12,000 in 
Fees in the Wind FarmInvestment
13.In order to obtain financing for the wi
nd-farm investment,Fund Aobtained a loan 
commitment from a third party.  As security for the loan, several of the investors in the wind-

farm investment provided letters
 of credit in their personal ca
pacity, which could be drawn upon
on in the event that the loan was not repaid in full.  
14.On or about May 21, 2015, Peterson and Pole
se Œwho was also an investor in the 
wind-farm investment Œobtained aletter of cr
editfrom the Financial Institution, payableto the 
third party, to guarantee a portion of the loan
 commitment.  In order to induce the Financial 
Institution to issue the letter of credit, Peters
on and Polese pledged C
lient B™s account as 
collateral, thus putting$400,000 of 
Client B™s assets at risk.
15.Client Bhad no knowledge of the letter of 
credit.  The letter of credit was issued 
by the Financial Institutionpursuant to an au
thorization form submitted by Peterson, listing 
Polese as the point of contact, and falsely sta
ting that Client B hadrequested the Financial 
Institutionto provide the letter of credit to the third party lender.Under the arrangement with the 

Financial Institution, if the third 
party lender drew on the letter of 
credit, the amounts paid by the 
Financial Institutionwould be
 drawnagainst Client B™scollateralizedloanaccount(ﬁLoan
Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 4 of 11 5Accountﬂ).  The Loan Account functioned in a 
manner similar to a margin account (where an 
investor borrows money and uses securities as collateral).  Client Boriginally established the 

Loan Account in order to pay certain large expe
nseswithout having to sell the securities in his 
portfolio.  Peterson completedthe form for Client B™sletterof credit and submitted it to the 

Financial Institution for approval.Neither Polesenor Peterson ever sought Client B™s 

authorization for the letter of credit, nor did either 
at any point inform Client B of its existence.  
Nor did Client Bin any way benefit fromthe issuan
ceof the letter of credit.  Rather, though the 
letter of credit was never drawn upon, meaning the 
lender never requested that Client B pay the 
$400,000, his account did incur $12,000in feesfor the i
ssuance and subsequent renewal of the 
letter of credit.  
16.The loan to the third party was eventually paid off and the letter of credit was
neverdrawn upon.  Client B never knewat the 
timethat Polese and Pe
terson had put$400,000 of 
his money atrisk.
Polese Continues to Abuse His Fiduciary Relationship with Client B
17.In July 2015, Polese breached his fiducia
ry duty as an Investment Adviser by 
taking advantage of his position of trust and conf
idence with Client B by asking Client B for a 
$50,000 loan to help pay for his children™s college
 expenses.  Polese knew that a loan from a 
client to an investment advise
r representative was prohibited by the Financial Institutionbecause 
it created an actual or potential conflict of intere
st between the client a
nd the investment adviser.
Despite Polese™s obligation to act in Client B™s 
best interests,the loan 
was disadvantageous to 
the client in numerous ways.  Specifically, the 
loan was not documented, there was no set payoff 
date, Polese did not provide Client B with any collateral, and 
did not agree to pay any interest on 
the loan. Polese also attempted to obscure the or
igins of the money by having Client B write a 
check to ﬁcash,ﬂ then usingthat check to obtai
n a treasurer™s check, in the name of abank.  
Polese then deposited the treasurer™s check into 
his personal account at 
the Financial Institution,
thus avoiding any record of Client B providing 
thefunds.  Polese failed to
 disclose the loan from 
Client B in connection with th
e Financial Instituti
on™s annual compliance 
questionnaires in 2016 Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 5 of 11 6and 2017.  By concealing the existence of the loan
,Polese prevented Client
 B from obtaining the 
benefit of Financ
ial Institution™s policies or controls relating to such loans.  To date,Polesehas 
not repaid the loan.Polese and Peterson Misapprop
riate $350,000 of Client B™s Money
18.InMarch 2016, Peterson and Polese 
fraudulentlyused $100,000 of Client B™s 
money to make$50,000investments for each of th
eir own benefitin aprivate real-estate fund 
(ﬁFund Bﬂ).On March 24, 2016,Peterson caused $350,000 
to be transferred by wire to FundB
from Client B™sLoanAccount, as payment for Po
lese and Peterson™s 
$50,000 interests.  The 
wire was initiated pursuant to a LoanAccountdisbur
sement sheet filled outi
n part by Polese and 
in partby Peterson, which falsely stated that Pe
terson had verified the tr
ansaction in a telephone 
conversation with Client Bthat morning.  No such call took place.
19.In addition, the disbursement sheet contai
ns Client B™s purported signature, which 
was forged by Polese and Peterson.
20.In connection with their purported purchas
e of interests in Fund B, both Polese 
and Peterson provided signed subscription agreemen
ts in which they falsely certified that the 
money they were using for their investments was 
not ﬁderived from, or related to, any activity 
that is deemed criminal under applicable law.ﬂ  The subscription documents explicitly stated that 

this condition had to be met in order for the company to accept the subscription.
21.Polese and Peters
on™s scheme also included usin
g the purported investment in 
Fund B as a means of routing $250,000 to Polese
™s personal account.  After receiving the 
$350,000 wire to fund what he 
believed would be two sepa
rate $50,000 investments, a
representative of FundBspoke with Polesea
bout the $250,000 in excess funds that had been 
wired.  Polese told the representative of Fund 
Bthat the payment was intended to cover both 
Polese™sand Peterson™si
nvestment.  Polesefurther stated
that the overpayment of $250,000 was 
the result of a clerical error, and that themoney 
had in fact been intended to pay certain of 
Polese™s tuition expenses for his children in 
college.  Polese then instructed the Fund B 
Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 6 of 11 7representativeto wire the money to Polese
™s personal bank account, which the Fund B 
representative did.
22.After misappropriating Client B™s 
$350,000, Polese and Peterson took stepsto 
conceal their theft of the money.  Aweek af
ter wiring the money out of Client B™sLoan 
Account,Defendants made separa
te false statements to Client B™s bookkeeper and to the 
Financial Institution claiming that the entire wired 
amount was in a real esta
te investment for the benefit ofClient B.  Defendants™statements we
re designed to prevent the bookkeeper and the 
Financial Institution from uncovering the fact that the Defendantshad used the purported 

investment in Fund B to steal 
approximately $350,000 from Client B.
23.During the course of the fraud, Peterson a
nd Polese both received distributions of 
$7,299.47 from FundBresulting from their $50,000 investments using Client B™s money.The 

$100,000 principal remains with Fund B.
Polese™s Unauthorized Automated Clearing
 HouseWithdrawals from
 Client B™sAccount
24.Between March 2 and May 2, 2017, Polese
 stole a total of just over $93,000 from 
Client Bby making unauthorized Automate
dClearing House (ﬁACHﬂ)payments on five 
separate occasions from Client B™sLoanAcc
ount.ACH is a computer-basedclearingand 
settlement facility established to process the exchange of electronic transactions.  For example, 

ACH is used for direct deposit payroll payments
.Polese used these ACH payments to pay for 
his credit card bills and college tuition payments for his children.
25.In one instance, Polese used an unauthorized ACH payment from Client B™s Loan 
Account to overpay a college tuition bill by $20,000. 
 Polese then directed the college to refund 
the overpayment to his own bank account. 
26.To execute these unauthorized ACH tran
sactions, Polese en
tered Client B™s 
account and bank routing numbers on the pa
yment pages of the payees™ websites.
27.The Financial Institution discovered Polese™s unauthorized ACH transactions in 
early May 2017.  On Friday, May 5, 2017,the 
Financial Institution placed Polese on 
Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 7 of 11 8administrative leave.  A few days later, afte
r further inquiry, the Financial Institutionplaced 
Peterson on administrative leave as well.  
28.In an effort to cover-up his thefts, Pole
se went to Client B™s house and attempted 
to cajole him into signing a false statementstating that ﬁYou Verbally Approved & Authorized 

Every Payment.  I [Client B]Have No Kids 
& Wanted To Help A Friend[.]ﬂClient B refused
because he had not approved and authorized the ACH transactions.Polese and Peterson were

terminated by the Financial Institutionshortly thereafter.
Another Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Polese for FalselyMisstating Advisory Fees
29.Between October 2014 and May 2017, Polese
 defrauded one of his clients, a 
retired paralegal (ﬁClient
 Cﬂ)by falsely representing that the advisory fee for her account was 
1%.  In actuality, Polese arranged for fees 
totaling 1.5 % to be wit
hdrawn from Client C™s 
account on a periodic basis.  By fraudulently inflat
ing Client C™s advisory
 fees by 50%, Polese 
caused Client C to pay excess advi
sory fees of approximately $23,000.

Case 1:18-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 01/31/18   Page 11 of 11"
148,148,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the entry of an emergency court order freezing assets related to alleged insider trading that yielded approximately $5 million in profits in connection with an acquisition announcement by biopharmaceutical companies Bioverativ, Inc. and Sanofi S.A.

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, identifies a series of suspicious transactions surrounding Monday's announcement of a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will acquire all of Bioverativ's outstanding shares for $105 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $11.6 billion and a 63 percent premium over Bioverativ's pre-announcement closing price.  The traders, who are currently unknown, allegedly used foreign brokerage accounts in Switzerland to purchase out-of-the-money call options through a U.S.-based brokerage firm and on U.S.-based exchanges in the days leading up to the public announcement of the acquisition.  The court's order freezes the proceeds related to the foreign accounts' trading.

According to the SEC's complaint, some of the options positions taken in these accounts prior to the announcement represented almost 100 percent of the market for those particular out-of-the-money options.  Following the acquisition announcement, Bioverativ's shares rose significantly and the brokerage account customers allegedly profited by selling many of the option contracts at a profit.

The emergency court order obtained by the SEC requires the traders to repatriate any funds or assets located outside the U.S. that were obtained from the alleged insider trading.  The traders also are prohibited from destroying any evidence.  The SEC's complaint charges the unknown traders with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.  The SEC is seeking a final judgment ordering the traders to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposing civil penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations.

The SEC's investigation is being conducted by Michael D. Hoke and supervised by Kurt L. Gottschall and Jason J. Burt of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC's litigation is being led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mark L. Williams. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."," Mark L.

This is an insider trading case involving highly suspicious trading by one ormore unknown traders (""Defendants"") in call option contracts (""calls"") of Bioverativ, Inc.(""Bioveratid') just prior to the Januazy 22, 2018, announcement (the ""Announcement"") thatBioverativ had entered into an agreement to be acquired for $105 per share by French societeanonyme Sanofi (""Sanofi""), a globallife sciences company. The $105 per share price represented a premium of 63.8% over Bioverativ's Friday, January 19, 2018 closing shareprice of $64.11.2. As a result of the Announcement, Bioverativ's share price increasedsubstantially, nearly reaching the price Sanofi offered in its tender offer. On Monday,January 22, 2018, Bioverativ shares opened at $104.21, reached a high of $104.30 for theday, and closed at $103.79 per share, a 61.9% increase over its January 19 closing price.Bioverativ had not closed at or above $64.12 per share at any point since it began trading onthe NASDAQ market in January 2017.3. Defendants, who may be foreign traders and who are trading through foreignaccounts, made highly suspicious, timely, and lucrative purchases and sales of options onBioverativ stock and generated profits of approximately $4.9 million.4. The identities of the Defendants are not yet known because the optionspurchase orders originated through a foreign brokerage firm located in Zurich, Switzerland.That foreign brokerage firm, in turn, cleared the transactions through a domestic brokeragefirm, which in turn executed the purchase orders through the facilities of a domestic optionsexchange.5. Defendants' trading in Bioverativ calls is highly suspicious. Between Friday,January 12, 2018 and Friday, January 19, 2018, immediately preceding the Announcement,Defendants purchased 1,610 out-of-the-money Bioverativ calls with strike prices between$65 and $75 and an expiration date of February 16, 2018, despite the fact that Bioverativshares had never closed above $64.11 per share. On January 22, 2018, after theAnnouncement made that same day, Defendants sold 732 of those contracts for a profit of2 approximately $2,518,622.70. Defendants sold an additional 75 contracts on January 23,2018, netting an additional $207,825 in profits. Based on the last reported sale prices onJanuary 24, 2018, Defendants' remaining options contracts were valued at approximately$2.2 million.6. Defendants' pre-Announcement purchases of short-term Bioverativ calloptions represented a significant share of all reported trades in Bioverativ options during therelevant period, including all or nearly all of the trades in particular series of Bioverativoptions on several days. Moreover, Defendants had never before placed reportable orders forBioverativ options through the same account. In light of the Defendants' large,unprecedented purchases of Bioverativ options just before the Announcement, oninformation and belief, Defendants purchased the Bioverativ calls while in possession ofmaterial, nonpublic information concerning the proposed acquisition of Bioverativ.II. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT7. The SEC brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it bySection 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C.§ 78u(d)].

The SEC also seeks permanent injunctions against theDefendants, enjoining them from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains from the unlawfulinsider trading activity set forth in this Complaint, together with prejudgment interest, andcivil penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u-1].

During the time of theconduct at issue, the main office of Credit Suisse Securities (USA), LLC, through whichDefendants' trades were cleared, was located in New York, New York.

Venue also lies in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(3) because, uponinformation and belief, the Defendants are not residents of the United States.11. Unless restrained and enjoined, the Defendants will continue to engage in theacts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, or in acts,practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar purport and object.IV.

Between January 12, 2018, and January 19, 2018, inclusive, Defendantspurchased 1,610 Bioverativ calls, all of which were ""out-of-the-money"" at the time ofpurchase, having strike prices between $65 and $75 per share. All of the purchased optionswere set to expire on February 16, 2018.16. Specifically, Defendants purchased the following:Date No. of Call Strike Price Avera e Percentage ofOption Premium Paid Trading ByContracts DefendantsPurchased Source:Bloomberg)1/12/2018 342 $65 $2.44 75%1/12/2018 370 $70 $.79 82%1/12/2018 100 $75 $.59 96%1/16/2018 3 $65 $3.10 1.9%1/16/2018 100 $75 $.80 97%1/17/2018 20 $65 $2.29 32.3%1 /17/2018 100 $75 $.50 95%1/18/2018 300 $75 $.59 100%1/19/2018 275 $75 $.56 50%TOTAL 1,61017. Defendants' purchases cost a total of approximately $170,081.18. Defendants' purchases made up a significant volume of all reportable optionstrades on those days, and on several days constituted all or nearly all of the trades in theparticular series of options contracts in which Defendants traded. 19. No other reportable trades in Bioverativ options had been placed through theCS Omnibus Account in the year leading up to the Announcementby Defendants oranyone else.20. All of Defendants' purchases of Bioverativ options as detailed above weremade after Sanofi and Bioverativ had taken substantial steps toward consummating anagreement pursuant to a tender offer.21. By November 3, 2017, Sanofi had delivered an unsolicited bid to acquireBioverativ for a definite price per share, after which Bioverativ began to contemplate selling.B. The Effect of the Announcement and Defendants' Sales22. Before the NASDAQ market open on January 22, 2018, Sanofi and Bioverativannounced their agreement that Sanofi would acquire the stock of Bioverativ. As a result ofthe Announcement, Bioverativ's share price increased substantially. On Monday, January22, 2018, Bioverativ shares opened at $104.21, reached a high of $104.30 for the day, andclosed at $103.79 per share, a 61.9% increase over its January 19 closing price.23. Bioverativ had not closed at or above $64.12 per share at any point since itbegan trading on the NASDAQ market in January 2017.24. On January 22, 2018, Defendants sold 362 call option contracts with a strikeprice of $65 at an average price of $38.60 and 370 ca11 option contracts with a strike price of$70 at an average price of $33.50. That is, Defendants sold all but 3 of their contracts with a$65 strike price, and all of their contracts with a $70 strike price. From these sales,Defendants received approximately $2,636,820 in proceeds, for a net profit of approximately7 $2,518,622.70 (assuming they retained the 3 most expensive contracts with a $65 strikeprice).25. At least some of the proceeds from the above sales were transferred toDefendants' accounts) in Switzerland.26. On January 23, 2018, Defendants sold 75 call option contracts with a strikeprice of $75, for additional profits of approximately $207,825, based on the last reported saleprice for January 23 of $28.30 and on a first-in-first-out basis.27. As of close-of-markets January 24, 2018, Defendants retained at least 803Bioverativ option contracts, which if sold at the last reported prices would result in additionalprofits of approximately $2,216,417.40.28. The timing, size, and profitability of the Defendants' trades, as well as thelack of prior history of significant trading in Bioverativ options in the CS Omnibus Account,make these trades highly suspicious. In particular, with no prior history of trading Bioverativoptions in the CS Omnibus Account, Defendants invested $170,081 in risky options in theten days prior to the Announcement, including significant purchases of risky options on thelast trading day before the Announcement. As a result of these well-timed trades, theDefendants' turned an investment of $170,081 into over $4.9 million in realized andunrealized profits, a return of more than 2900% in less than two weeks.29. Upon information and belief, at the time the Defendants purchased Bioverativoptions as set forth above, they were in possession of material, nonpublic information aboutSanofi's impending acquisition of Bioverativ. The Defendants: (a) knew, recklesslydisregazded, or should have known that their trading was in breach of a fiduciary duty, or8 obligation arising from a similar relationship of trust and confidence, owed to theshareholders of Bioverativ, or to the source from whom they received the material, nonpublicinformation; and/or (b) knew, recklessly disregarded, or should have known that the material,nonpublic information about the impending acquisition that had been conveyed to them wasdisclosed or misappropriated in breach of a fiduciary duty, or similar relationship of trust andconfidence.30. Upon information and belief, any and all material nonpublic information that theDefendants received concerning Bioverativ as set forth above was disclosed to them by aperson or persons who tipped such information with the expectation of receiving a benefit.FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEFViolations of Ezchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule lOb-5 Thereunder (Against AllDefendants)31.

149,149,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint today in U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada against Quicksilver Stock Transfer, LLC, a Las Vegas-based registered transfer agent, and its president and sole owner, Alan Shinderman alleging that they misappropriated approximately $630,000 of client funds.

The SEC alleged that, in August 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1.45 million for the benefit of China Energy Corporation. The funds were destined for certain of China Energy's shareholders by way of Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The complaint alleges that Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of this money for his and Quicksilver's own use and benefit, including $500,000 to make a four-day loan to a Nevada real estate company.  According to the complaint, the borrower failed to repay the principal or interest as planned. Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman did not timely forward China Energy's funds to DTCC, despite repeated requests. Quicksilver and Shinderman also made a series of misrepresentations in response China Energy's and DTCC's requests for the funds.  Quicksilver ultimately paid DTCC approximately six weeks later, after recovering the loan principal from the real estate company. The complaint also alleges that Quicksilver untimely filed an independent accountant's report with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 31, 2013.

The SEC's complaint charges Quicksilver with violations of Sections 10(b) and 17A(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 17Ad-12 and 17Ad-13 thereunder and Shinderman with violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and for aiding and abetting Quicksilver's violations of Section 17A(d) and Rules 17Ad-12 and 17Ad-13. The SEC complaint seeks permanent injunctions and the imposition of civil penalties.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Melissia A. Buckhalter-Honore of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Spencer E. Bendell. David J. VanHavermaat will lead the SEC's litigation.","  COMPLAINT 1   12

SUMMARY 4. This matter involves fraud by Quicksilver, an SEC-registered transfer 
agent, and Shinderman, its principal and so
le owner.  Quicksilver and Shinderman misappropriated funds provided by an issuer-c
lient of Quicksilver that were supposed to go to shareholders.  In addition, Quicksilver also untimely filed an independent 
accountant™s report with the SEC. 5. In August of 2013, Quicksilver 
received wire transfers totaling $1,450,000 for the benefit of China Energy Corporation (ﬁChina Energyﬂ), one of 
Quicksilver™s issuer-clients.  The funds were
 to be transferred to Depository Trust & 
Clearing Corporation (ﬁDTCCﬂ) to be disbursed to certain of China Energy™s 
shareholders who participated in a reverse stock split and going private transaction by 
China Energy.   6. Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of the funds received for 
the benefit of China Energy and its shareholders for his own benefit.  Of the misappropriated funds, Shinderman used 
$500,000 without authorization to make an 
investment for the benefit of Quicksilver
 on August 23, 2013.  The investment was a 
short-term loan to a Nevada real estate
 investment company that was to repay 
Quicksilver with a 5% return in four days.  
7. The borrower on the short-term loan, however, did not repay the principal or pay the interest on time.  Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 2 of 11  COMPLAINT 3   12

$1,450,000) to DTCC when requested.  Despite repeated requests from China Energy and DTCC to pay the full amount to DTCC for the benefit of China Energy™s 

shareholders, Quicksilver and Shinderman 
only made a series of partial payments over six weeks. 8. After threatening to sue the real es
tate investment company to recover 
the loan principal, Quicksilver and Shin
derman finally recovered the $500,000 from 
the real estate investment company on October 23, 2013.  Shinderman caused 
Quicksilver to forward $500,000 to DTCC that same day.  Quicksilver made the final payment of the misappropriated f
unds to DTCC on November 6, 2013. 
9. By misappropriating client funds for 
their own benefit, Quicksilver and Shinderman violated the antifraud provisions
 of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  10. In addition, Quicksilver violated, and Shinderman aided and abetted Quicksilver™s violations of, Section 17A(d
)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17Ad-12 thereunder, which require transfer agents that have possession or custody of funds 
related to its transfer agent activities to assure that all such funds are protected against 
misuse.  
11. Quicksilver also violated, and Shinderman aided and abetted 
Quicksilver™s violations of, Rule 17Ad-
13 under the Exchange Act, which requires transfer agents to file annually with the SEC an independent accountant™s report concerning the transfer agent™s system of internal accounting controls and related 
procedures for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds.  Quicksilver™s report 
for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 
required to be filed by March 31, 2014, but was not filed until January 13, 2015. 12. With this action, the SEC seeks perm
anent injunctions and civil penalties against Quicksilver and Shinderman. Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 3 of 11  COMPLAINT 4   12

28THE DEFENDANTS 
13. Quicksilver Stock Transfer, LLC
 is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Quicksilver has been registered with the SEC as a transfer agent since August 8, 2007.   14. Alan Shinderman resides in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Shinderman has been 
the president and sole owner of Quicksilver since September 2008.   
THE ALLEGATIONS 
A. Background 
15. China Energy is a China-based Nevada corporation that produces, 
processes, and sells raw coal products in the People™s 
Republic of China.  The company was founded in 2000 a
nd is based in Hohhot, People™s Republic of China.  
China Energy was incorporated in Nevada on October 11, 2002.  China Energy™s corporate status went into default in October 2015, and the current status is listed as revoked.   16. Quicksilver served as the transfer
 agent for China Energy in 2013.  
Among the services that Quicksilver had 
agreed to provide China Energy were 
issuing stock certificates and warrants, disbursing dividends, and holding all unpaid 
and undisbursed funds unless instructed otherwise by China Energy.   
17. In September 2013, China Energy effected a reverse stock split as part of 
a going private transaction.   
18. DTCC was responsible for the admi
nistration of funding for China Energy™s stock redemption in connecti
on with the reverse stock split.   19. In connection with the reverse stock split, Quicksilver was to pay DTCC for shareholders who tendered their shares for redemption as part of the going private 
transaction.  To fund those payments, China Energy had wired a total of $1,450,000 
to Quicksilver™s bank account through three wire transfers between August 5 and August 15, 2013.  As part of the reverse stock split and redemption process, China 
Energy instructed Quicksilver to forward the funds that Quicksilver was holding for

 to effect the redemptions. 20. Shinderman had sole signatory authority over Quicksilver™s bank 
account.  Quicksilver™s bank account had a balance of only approximately $1,000 
prior to receiving the first wire transfer of $50,000 from China Energy on August 5, 
2013.  
21. On August 5, 2013, DTCC sent its first instruction to Quicksilver for a 
payment of $34,568.80.  Two days later,
 Quicksilver received authorization from 
China Energy to make that payment to DT
CC, and two days after that, on August 9, Quicksilver made the requested paym
ent to DTCC by wire transfer.   
22. On August 9, 2013, DTCC sent a second instruction for payment in the amount of $17,381.56.  After subseque
nt discussions between DTCC and 
Quicksilver, Quicksilver represented to DTCC that it would remit the entire balance 
to DTCC once the reverse split was fully effective.   B. Misappropriation of China Energy™s Funds 
23. Quicksilver did not maintain in its 
bank account the balance of the funds it had received from China Energy for th
e benefit of China Energy and its shareholders.  Rather, Quicksilver and Shinderman, without authorization by China 
Energy, diverted over $630,000 for their own uses, including $500,000 to an investment for the benefit of Quicksilver.   
24. On August 23, Shinderman caused Qu
icksilver to make a $500,000 loan to First 100, LLC (ﬁFirst 100ﬂ), a Nevada real estate investment company, 
memorialized by a promissory note for the 
benefit of Quicksilver.  China Energy did not authorize the use of its funds for the loan to First 100.   
25. The terms of the loan provided that 
Quicksilver was to be repaid the 
entire amount of the principal along with $25,00
0, a 5% return, after four days.  First 100, however, failed to repay the loan on time.  26. In addition to the misappropriation 
of $500,000 for the unauthorized investment with First 100, 
Shinderman also caused Quicksilver to make improper

28payments to other entities and individuals with China Energy funds from 
Quicksilver™s bank account, without authorization from China Energy.  Those 
unauthorized payments included: (a) a paym
ent of $51,000 to an entity unrelated to China Energy on August 5, 2013, the same da
y that Quicksilver received the initial wire transfer of $50,000 from China Ener
gy; (b) payments totaling $33,222.14 to another entity unrelated to China Energy Corporation in August and September 2013; 
(c) $10,350 to Shinderman™s landlord on 
August 26, 2013; and (d) other payments 
and withdrawals by Shinderman unrelated 
to China Energy totaling over $36,900 in 
August and September 2013. 
27. By August 30, 2013, Quicksilver™s bank account that had received the 
$1,450,000 wire from China Energy to effect its stock redemptions had a balance of 
only $819,563.11. 
28. China Energy™s reverse stock split became effective on September 18, 2013.  On that same date, DTCC sent instructions to Quicksilver to make a final 
payment to DTCC in the amount of $1
,247,465.38, which included the $17,381.56 payment Quicksilver had previously not remitted.   
29. Because it had diverted substantial amounts of China Energy™s funds to 
make the loan to First 100 and for other improper and undisclosed purposes, 
Quicksilver and Shinderman did not have funds available to make the required payment to DTCC.  Therefore, instead of immediately paying the required funds to 
DTCC on behalf of China Energy, Quicksilver made a series of partial payments to DTCC over the course of six weeks.  Quicksilver paid $500,000 on October 2, and 
$220,500 on October 4, 2013.   30. Shinderman made a series of mi
srepresentations in responding to 
multiple inquiries from China Energy and DT
CC regarding the reasons for the delay in returning China Energy™s funds.  For ex
ample, on October 21, 2013, Shinderman 
falsely represented to DTCC that he was encountering difficulties with his bank in 
getting a wire to DTCC to go through, when in fact he did not have sufficient funds in Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 6 of 11  COMPLAINT 7   12

 recover the amounts due
.  Quicksilver and First 100 entered into a settlement agreement whereby First 100 paid Quicksilver the $500,000 principal back, without 
interest, on October 23, 2013. 32. On October 23, 2013, upon recovering 
the $500,000 loan principal from 
First 100, Quicksilver paid $500,000 to DTCC.  Quicksilver paid the outstanding balance of $26,902.38 to DTCC on November 6, 2013.   
 C. Failure to File Time
ly Accountant™s Report 33. Rule 17Ad-13 of the Exchange Act requires all transfer agents to file annually with the SEC an independent accountant™s report concerning the transfer 
agent™s system of internal accounting contro
l and related procedures for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds.   
34. Quicksilver untimely filed an inde
pendent accountant™s report required by Rule 17Ad-13 with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 
31, 2013.  The accountant™s report was required to be filed by March 31, 2014, but was not filed until January 13, 2015.  As the principal of Quicksilver, Shinderman 
was responsible for the untimely filing of the accountant™s report. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in the Connection with the Pu

150,150,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today an order in the bankruptcy action involving Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC, et al., Case No. 17-12560 (KJC), resolving motions on behalf of the SEC, Creditors, as well as Debtors Woodbridge and affiliated companies. The resolution follows several days of a vigorously contested hearing regarding the control and management of Woodbridge while it is in bankruptcy. During the hearing, the SEC presented substantial evidence of fraud committed by Woodbridge prior to filing for bankruptcy.

In a hearing yesterday, the Honorable Judge Kevin J. Carey of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved a settlement Term Sheet presented by the SEC, the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, and Ad Hoc Committees of Unitholders and Noteholders. Among other things, the settlement provides for the appointment of a New Board of Managers consisting of representatives recommended by the parties which will take necessary actions for managing Woodbridge. The settlement also provides for the SEC's consent, not unreasonably withheld, to the retention of a CEO or Chief Restructuring Officer, and the selection of Debtors' professionals.

Judge Carey's Order approving the Term Sheet stated that the resolution is in the best interest of the Creditors, the Committee, the Debtors, their estates, and other parties in interest, and provided the appointment of a New Board of Managers, which will select a CEO or Chief Restructuring Officer for the Debtors. In furtherance of the settlement, the SEC has agreed to dismiss its request in the District Court action for the appointment of a receiver over the Debtors and related entities.

According to the Term Sheet attached to the Order, all parties will also cooperate in facilitating non-debtor entities, subject to the asset freeze by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, to come under control of the New Board and under jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court administering the Woodbridge Chapter 11 cases. The settlement also provided for the formation and appointment of Unitholders and Noteholders committees, to represent the interests of investors who purchased Woodbridge notes and unit investments.

The SEC's litigation in the bankruptcy case has been led by David W. Baddley, Russell Koonin, Christine Nestor, Alistaire Bambach, Scott A. Lowry and Neal Jacobson, and has been supervised by Andrew O. Schiff in the Miami Regional Office. The SEC is continuing its District Court litigation. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mr. Lowry, Linda S. Schmidt and Mark Dee, and supervised by Jason R. Berkowitz and Fernando Torres."," Inre IN THE UNITED ST ATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE Chapter 11 WOODBRIDGE GROUP OF COMPANIES, LLC, et al.,1 Case No. 17-12560 (KJC) (Jointly Administered) Debtors.

In settlement of the motion to form an official Unitholders committee filed on January 8, 2018 (Docket No. 250), the Unitholders will be permitted to form a single 1-2 member Ad Hoc Unitholder Group with an all-in professional budget not to exceed $1.5 million through January 1, 2019. Not to duplicate the Committee's or the proposed Ad Hoc Noteholders (who claim they are secured) responsibilities, the Ad Hoc Unitholder Group will be tasked with litigating and/or negotiating (a) whether Unitholders should be treated as creditors or equity security holders in these chapter 11 cases, including in cormection with any plan or asset disposition and (b) whether substantive consolidation is in the best interests of the Unitholders; 12. In settlement of the motion to form an official Noteholder committee, the Noteholder movants (who claim they are secured) will be permitted to form a single 6 -9 
member Ad Hoc Noteholder Group (with the Ad Hoc Unitholder Group, the ""Ad Hoc Groups"") with an all-in professional budget of $2.25 million through January 1, 2019. Not to duplicate the Committee's or the proposed Ad Hoc Unitholders Group's responsibilities, the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group will be tasked with litigating and/or negotiating any aspects of Noteholder treatment in the cases, focused primarily on whether Noteholders are secured, whether if secured the Noteholders are better off with substantive consolidation of the estates or not, and traditional secured creditor protections such as adequate protections for the Noteholders and upon sales of properties the use of the sales proceeds; 13. The Ad Hoc Groups and their members shall (i) be considered fiduciaries of the Unitholders/Noteholders which such Ad Hoc Group and its members represent, (ii) be deemed parties in interest under Section 1109 of the Bankruptcy Code, (iii) with respect to parties who hold Units or Notes, as the case may be, and who are not members of the representative Ad Hoc Group (a) provide access to information to such parties, (b) solicit and receive comments from such parties and ( c) be subject to a court order that compels any additional report or disclosure to be made to such parties, and (iv) have the rights to (a) select and authorize the employment of one or more attorneys, accountants or other agents to represent and/or perform services for such Ad Hoc Group, subject to the all-in budgets described in paragraphs 11 and 12, above, (b) subject to the tasks described in paragraphs 11 and 12 above (I) consult with the Debtors and their advisors or any trustee appointed in these cases concerning administration of the case, (II) investigate the acts, conduct, assets, liabilities and financial condition of the Debtors, the operation of the Debtors' businesses and the desirability of the continuance of such business and any 
other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a plan, (III) participate in the formulation of a plan, advise those represented by such Ad Hoc Group of such Ad Hoc Group's determination as to any plan formulated, (IV) request the appointment of a 01:22768081.6 Case 17-12560-KJC Doc 357-1 Filed 01/23/18 Page 4 of 5 
 trustee or examiner under section 1104 of the Bankruptcy Code and (V) perform such other services as are in the interests of those represented;2 14. Professionals for the Ad Hoc Groups shall be retained pursuant to Court order and shall file fee applications each month with the Bankruptcy Court, and shall be subject to approval of fee amounts by the Bankruptcy Court and review of fees in accordance with the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Rules, the U.S. Trustee Guidelines and as otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, including sections 330 and 331, with parties in interest encouraged to meet and confer on scope and budget issues promptly with respect to such fee applications; 15. The Ad Hoc Groups shall be granted regular access to the Debtors' advisors in a manner consistent with that typically granted to official statutory committees; 16. In an effort to avoid duplication by financial advisors to the various groups, FTI will provide information to the Ad Hoc Groups. FTI will not render any opinions or recommendations to the Ad Hoc Groups, other than as their role as financial advisor to the Committee. In no way will FTI be deemed to represent either or both of the Ad Hoc Groups and in the event of any litigation or other form of dispute resolution FTI will represent the Committee's interests and no other constituency in the case and no conflict claim may be made by any party that FTI cannot represent the Committee in any dispute with any other party. All applicable privileges between the Committee, 
its other retained professionals (Pachulski Stang Ziehl and Jones LLP) and FTI are preserved and are not waived; and 17. In the event that an Ad Hoc Group seeks to augment their budget or scope as set forth in paragraphs 11 and 12 above, such requests shall require the moving party to establish appropriateness of the request by clear and convincing evidence. 2 The appointment of the Ad Hoc Groups shall not in any way limit the Committee's duties and responsibilities under the Bankruptcy Code. 01:22768081.6 Case 17-12560-KJC Doc 357-1 Filed 01/23/18 Page 5 of 5 "
152,152,"The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas last week entered consent judgments in a fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against The Ticket Reserve Inc.'s (TTR) former CEO, Richard Harmon, and former COO, John Kaptrosky. The final judgment against Harmon, who was also Chairman of TTR's Board of Directors, ordered him to pay $945,078.22, including $620,078.22 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $325,000 civil penalty. Monetary remedies against Kaptrosky will be determined by the Court at a later time.

As alleged in the SEC's First Amended Complaint, filed contemporaneously with the proposed consent judgments, Harmon and Kaptrosky engaged in a fraudulent scheme by raising funds from investors through TTR without disclosing that TTR was in severe financial distress. Harmon misappropriated more than $500,000 from individual investors for his own benefit, including for lease payments on a vacation home and his personal residence. The SEC further alleged that Ash Narayan, who previously settled the SEC's charges, misappropriated more than $2 million from individual investors. The defendants also made material misrepresentations to investors regarding the financial health of TTR and prolonged their fraudulent scheme by backdating documents and making Ponzi-like payments to keep the scheme from collapsing.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's First Amended Complaint, Harmon and Kaptrosky also consented to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

These settlements follow an emergency action initiated on May 24, 2016 and announced on June 21, 2016. In the emergency action, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order halting the fraud along with an order appointing a receiver over TTR.

The SEC's litigation is being led by Chris Davis in the SEC's Fort Worth office. The investigation was conducted by Keith J. Hunter and Carol J. Hahn and supervised by Eric R. Werner. Jessica B. Magee and B. David Fraser are supervising the matter."," IN THE

COMPLAINT
  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (
""SEC
"") alleges as follows:
 SUMMARY
  1. The SEC is bringing this 
case 
to stop a
 multi
-million 
dollar fraud scheme
.  The 
scheme 
was
 carried out
 by Defendant
s Ash Narayan, 
Richard Harmon and
 John Kaptrosky
 through Defendant The Ticket Reserve Inc. (""TTR"")
.  TTR was controlled by Harmon
Šwho 
was its Chief Executive Officer (""CEO""), 
Board Chair
, and controlling stockholder.    
Kaptrosky 
was TTR's Chief Operating Officer (""COO"").
 Narayan was on its Board.
 2. Almost always without their knowledge or consent, Narayan directed his clients 
into high
-risk investments in TTR.  In exchange, he received almost $2 million in undisclosed 
finder's fees.  Harmon also received $544,800 
in funds
 misappropriated from TTR's investors.
 3. The Defendants obscured the misappropriation of investor funds by 
                                                                                          Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 1 of 31   PageID 2547 SEC

   Page

31  First Amended 
Complaint
   mischaracterizing Narayan's finder's fees as either ""director's fees"" or ""loans.""  
They
 also
 entered 
into 
""lease"" agreements 
through which 
funds 
were
 diverted to Harmon.  
Finally, they
 prolonged
 the scheme by creating fraudulent documents
Šsometimes backdated
Šand by making Ponzi
-like payments in order to 
keep the scheme from collapsing
. 4. The 
Defendants also
 misled investors while carrying out the scheme.  
They
 told 
investors that TTR was strong financial
ly and a good investment
.  They did not disclose 
the 
truth
Šthat TTR was in 
very poor
 financial shape and could barely survive from month to mo
nth.
  They also told investors that their investments would be used to build TTR's business
Šwhen the 
truth was that a substantial portion of their funds would be 
diverted
 to Narayan and Harmon.
  Finally, 
Narayan 
held
 himself out as a 
Certified Public Accou
ntant (""
CPA
"") even though
 he is 
not and never has been a CPA.
 5. Acting at Harmon's and Nar
ayan's direction, Kaptrosky aided and abetted the
 fraud.  
Kaptrosky carried
 out their
 instructions that TTR engage in the improper conduct 
described above and detailed below
Šincluding
 misappropriating investor funds to 
mak
e payments to 
Narayan
 and Harmon
 and distributing misleading documents to investors. 
 6. By 
engaging in the conduct
 all
eged in this Complaint, the Defendants 
committed
 and/or aided and abetted 
violat
ions of
 the 
anti
fraud provisions of the federal securities laws
.  Thus, 
in the interest of protecting the public from further illegal activity, 
the SEC 
brings this 
action seeking 
all available relief
Šincluding temporary, preliminary, and 
permanent injunctions
; disgorgement 
of all ill
-gotten gains
 plus prejudgment interest
; and
 civil 
money penalties.

 FACTS
 I. NARAYAN WAS AN INVEST
MENT ADVISER WHO BUI
LT A RELATIONSHIP OF
 TRUST WITH 
HIS CLIENTS
.  13. As 
an investment 
advis
er representative
, Narayan 
had
 fiduciary
 duties to his 
clients.
  He had
 an affirmative duty of utmost good faith to 
them.  He was required to 
make full 
and fair disclosure of all material facts
Šincluding all actual or potential conflicts of interest.  He 
                                                           1 TTR is now in Receivership and is operating out of Dallas, TX.
                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 3 of 31   PageID 2549 SEC
 v. Narayan, et al.
   Page 
4 of 
31  First Amended 
Complaint
   was required to
 act in 
his clients'
 best interest
s and to place their interest
s above his own
.  And he 
was required to provide suitable investment advice to 
each client in light of 
that
 client
's financial 
situation, investment experience, and investment objectives.
 14. Many of Narayan
's former advisory clients are high n
et worth individuals.  His 
clients included many
 current and former professional athletes.  
Three of these former clients
ŠClient
 One, a former Major League Baseball (""MLB"") players; Client Two, a current MLB 
player; and Client Three, a current National Football League (""NFL"") player
Šexemplify the 
type of clients Narayan advised.
 15. Many of 
these
 clients
Šincluding 
Client One, Clien
t Two, and Client Three
Šlacked meaningful financial or
 investment
 expertise.  They therefore
 relied on Narayan
, who 
owed each of them fiduciary duties,
 to make 
important 
finan
cial decisions on their behalf.  
Perhaps most importantly, Narayan advised them o
n what investments their investment 
portfolios should include.  
Narayan's clients
Šincluding Client One, Client Two, and Client 
Three
Šentered into advisory agreements
 with RGT under which Narayan would manage their 
investments.
 16. Narayan's clients trusted
 him
Šnot only because of their fiduciary relationship, 
but also because of his professional qualifications and experience.  Narayan knowingly or 
recklessly represented to these clients that he was a certified public accountant (""CPA"").  For 
instance, b
oth 
his 
RGT 
email signature blo
ck and his letterhead read ""
Ash Nara
yan, J.D., CPA.""
  His claim that he was a CPA boosted Narayan'
s credibility.  It served as a basis on which his 
clients
Šlike Client One, Client Two, and Client Three
Šbelieved he was capable of 
managing
 their money 
conservatively and in accordance with the law.  In reality, however, Narayan is 
notŠand never has been
Ša CPA.
                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 4 of 31   PageID 2550 SEC
 v. Narayan, et al.
   Page 
5 of 
31  First Amended 
Complaint
   i. Client One Trusted Narayan to manage his investments.
 17. Client One is
 a former 
MLB player who retired in 2013.  He met 
Narayan
 through 
his agent
 in 
the
 2002-03 timeframe.
  When they met, Client One
 learned that
 Narayan 
advised
 a number of other 
professional baseball players.  
 18. Narayan built a relationship of trust with 
Client One.  That trust was
 based, in 
part, on thei
r shared Christian faith and interest in charitable work.  
Client One'
s personal 
trust in 
Narayan
Šas well 
as his understanding of Narayan'
s competence and experience providing sound 
financial advice
Šwere important to 
Client One
 when he was considering whether to hire 
Narayan as his investment advis
er representative
.  19. Before hiring Narayan, 
Client One
 told
 him that he 
want
ed to pursue conservative 
investments that would not place his principal at risk.  Narayan agreed to purs
ue a low
-risk 
investment strategy aligned with 
Client One'
s goals.  With this understanding, 
Client One
 engaged Narayan as his investment advis
er representative
 in 
the 2002
-03 timeframe
. 20. At Narayan
's direction, a
s much as 80% 
of 
Client One'
s MLB
 salary
 was directly 
deposited to a brokerage account
.  Narayan
 manag
ed these funds on 
Client One'
s behalf.
  Client 
One understood that these funds would be managed by Narayan as they had discussed
Šby 
investing in conservative, low
-risk investments.
 21. When nece
ssary, 
Client One
 signed the paperwork that Narayan sent hi
m.  He 
always
 did so
 with the understanding that Narayan was pursuing the conservative investment 
strategy they had agreed upon
.  He further believed
 that the documents he signed for Narayan 
were c
onsistent with that strategy.  
Finally, Client One
 also 
trusted 
Narayan
 and understood him
 to be acting as a fiduciary
Šputting 
Client One'
s interests above his own
 and fully disclosing all 
material facts, including conflicts of interest
.                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 5 of 31   PageID 2551 SEC
 v. Narayan, et al.

Complaint
   ii. Client Two 
Trusted Narayan to manage his investments.
 22. Client Two is a current MLB player.  He
 met Narayan in 
the 
2004-05 timeframe 
through another MLB player who
 was a
 Narayan 
client
.  When they met, 
Client Two
 understood 
that Narayan was 
also 
managing 
Client One
's investments.
 23. As with 
Client One
, Narayan forged a relationship of trust with 
Client Two.  That 
trust was
 based, in part, on their shared Christian faith and interest in charitable work.  
Client 
Two'
s personal 
trust in Narayan
Šas well 
as his understa
nding of Narayan'
s competence and 
experience providing sound financial advice
Šwere important to 
Client Two
 when he was 
considering whether to hire Narayan as his investment advis
er representative
. 24. Before retaining Narayan
, Client Two
 explained to 
him
 that he wanted to pursue 
an investment strategy with minimal risk
.  This was true for at least two reasons.  First, Client 
Two
 was still working under his first MLB contract.  Second, Client Two knew that as an MLB 
player his earning potential might be re
alized within a very limited time window
.  Client Two
 therefore
 tol
d Narayan that his goal was to achieve financial security through conservative 
investments while he was still playing.  Narayan agreed to pursue a low
-risk strategy.
  With this 
understandin
g, 
Client Two
 engaged Narayan as his investment advis
er representative
 in 
the 
2004-05 timeframe
. 25. Once Narayan became Client Two's investment adviser representative, a
 significant 
portion of 
Client Two'
s MLB salary was transmitted to Narayan
.  Client Tw
o understood that those funds would 
to be invested pursuant to the low
-risk strategy 
that
 Narayan
 had
 agreed 
to follow
. iii. Client Three Trusted Narayan to manage his investments.
 26. Client Three is a current NFL player.  He
 met Narayan in 
2009Šthe same 
year he 
                                                                                          Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 6 of 31   PageID 2552 SEC

   left college to pursue an NFL career.
  At that time, he was looking for someone to help him 
invest his NFL earnings
.  Client Three learned by talking to Narayan that he was advising many 
other professional athletes, including a number of NFL player
s. 27. As with 
Client One and Client Two
, Narayan forged a relationship of trust with 
Client Three.  That trust was based,
 in part, on their shared Christian faith and interest in 
charitable work.
  Client Three also learned that they had attended the same church in California.
  Client Three'
s trust in Narayan personally
Šas well 
as his understanding of Narayan'
s competence and experience providing sound financial advice
Šwere important to 
Client Thre
e when he was considering whether to hire Narayan as his investment advis
er representative
. 28. Before retaining Narayan
, Client Three
 explained to 
him
 that he wanted to
 pursue
 safe, conservative investments that would not put his investment principal at r
isk.  He and 
Narayan also discussed the fact that as a professional athlete in a sport that has a high risk of 
injury, his earnings might be realized within a short window.  Narayan thus agreed that he would 
pursue a conservative strategy involving minimal
 risk.  
With this understanding, 
Client Three
 engaged Narayan as his investment advis
er representative 
in 2009. 29. Narayan, working with Client Three's NFL employers, arranged for the direct 
deposit of his NFL paychecks.  His weekly paychecks were deposit
ed into accounts that were 
setup by Narayan and RGT.  Narayan was responsible for allocating and managing Client 
Three's earnings in an investment account as they had discussed
Šby investing in conservative, 
low
-risk investments.
 II. THROUGH 
TTR,
 THE 
DEFENDANTS 
CARRIED OUT 
A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD 
INVESTORS
.  30. The Defendants were part of a scheme to defraud investors.
  The essence of the 
scheme was to continually raise funds through TTR and then misappropriate substantial portions 
                                                                                          Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 7 of 31   PageID 2553 SEC
 v. Narayan, et al.

   of these funds for the benefit of Narayan and Harmon. 
 Between
 May 26, 
2011 and May 26, 
2015, TTR raised
 approximately
 7 million
 from 
its 
investors
.  Approximately
 $2.4 million of 
this 
money w
as misappropriated by Narayan and Harmon.
 31. Even though the 
Defendants knew that TTR was a failing business that could not 
stay afloat on its own, they continued to raise fund
s in order to keep TTR
Šand thereby the 
scheme
Šafloat.  They obscured the misappropriation of investor funds by mischaracterizing 
finder's fee
s paid to 
Narayan as either ""director's fees"" or ""loans.""  
They 
also orchestrated
 ""lease"" 
agreements 
through which funds were 
diverted to Harmon.  Finally, they 
prolonged
 the scheme 
by creating fraudulent documents
Šsometimes backdated
Šand by making Ponzi
-like payments 
in order to 
keep the scheme from collapsing
.  i. The Defendants owned and/or controlled TTR.
 32. TTR was founded in 2002.  TTR licenses intellectual property that that lets fans 
reserve face
-value tickets to high
-demand sporting events whose t
eams are yet to be 
determined
Šcollege football bowl games, for example.  Fans pay a fee for the right to reserve 
these tickets.  
Harmon has described TTR's business model as ""monetizing anticipation"" in a 
world in which ""people spend a lot more time 
anticipating stuff than actually doing stuff.""
2 33. As TTR's CEO, 
Board 
Chairman, and controlling stockholder
, Harmon
 directed 
all of 
its activities.
  Harmon 
was
 also
 a signer on all TTR bank accounts
 and 
had complete 
control over
 how TTR money was spent
. 34. As detailed above, 
Narayan 
was
 on TTR™s Board
, owned
 over three million shares 
of TTR stock
, and was
 TTR's primary fundraiser.
  As a result
, Narayan exerted significant 
influence
 over TTR
.  He and Harmon regularly coordinated and directed TTR's activit
ies.

   35. As TTR's COO
, Kaptrosky
 was responsible for running 
its day
-to-day operations.  
He reported to Harmon
Šwho had the final say on all TTR business decisions.
  He also 
regularly 
conferred with
 Narayan
 on these decisions
Šincluding how investor money would be spent
. ii. The Defendant
s raised
Šand then
 misappropriated
Šfunds from investors.
 36. From 2011
-16, Narayan 
continuously
 raised
 money for TTR.
  Harmon also raised 
money
 in mid to late 2011 
as part of 
an offering of TTR's common stock
 (""the 2011 offering"")
.  The fundraising was crucial, because without it TTR could not have survived.
 37. As detailed below, these f
unds were supposed to be 
used
 to help grow TTR's 
business.  Instead, funds were systematica
lly misappropriated.  
Approximately 
$1.8 million 
was 
diverted
 to Narayan as finder's fees.  Another $544,800
.00 was diverted
 to Harmon
 as follows
: (1) $204,500.00 to pay for Harmon's condo in Palm Springs; (2) $170,800.00 to pay for his 
residence at the Fo
ur Seasons in Austin; and (3) $169,500.00 paid 
directly 
to Harmon
 out of the 
2011 offering
. 38. Between May 26, 2011 and the end of that year, 
TTR raised
 at least
 $446,000 
in the 2011 offering
.  This money was supposed to be invested in TTR's business.
  Instead, a
t Harmon's direction, virtually all of 
it was misappropriated.  Harmon 
received
 $169,500.00 in 
misappropriated funds
.  Narayan received $30,000
.00.  Other large expenditures included 
rough
ly 
$64,000 for delinquent payroll taxes and $119,000 for 
payroll.
 39. Harmon also misappropriated investor funds
 through two 
""lease
"" agreements
.  The first was
 a lease on a vacation condo in Palm Springs, California
 (the ""Palm Springs 
condo"")
.  The second was
 a lease on a condo at the Four Seasons Residences in 
Austin
, Texas
 (the ""Four Seasons condo"")
. 40. In January 2012, Harmon arranged 
to lease the Palm Springs condo
Šwhich he 
                                                                                          Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 9 of 31   PageID 2555 SEC

   owns
Što TTR.  He directed Kaptrosky to sign the lease on behalf of TTR, which Kaptrosky did.  
The lease provided that TTR would pay Harm
on $2,500 per month.  In January 2013, 
Harmon
 amended
 the lease
 to increase TTR's rent to $5,000.  Between July 2011 and February 2016, 
TTR paid Harmon
 at least $20
4,500.00 under this lease
.  Kaptrosky made these payments at 
Harmon's direction.
 41. This arrangement 
had no legitimate business purpose
.  Harmon, who controlled 
TTR, was essentially leasing a home from himself.
  Therefore, the lease was merely a vehicle to
 allow
 Harmon 
to divert money from TTR
's investors
 to himself
. 42. At Harmon's direc
tion, TTR entered into a similar 
fraudulent 
lease involving the 
Four Seasons condo.  
Harmon set up t
his lease in 
January 2012.  It
 was between the owner of the 
condo
 as lessor 
and TTR
3 c/o Rick Harmon as 
lessee
.  The lease was extended twice
Šthrough 
amendments in June 2014 and March 2014.
  Harmon executed the lease and amendments as 
TTR's CEO.  
  Between March 2012 and October 2013, TTR paid 
$170,800.00 under the lease
.  Kaptrosky made these payments at Harmon's direction.
   43.  Again, this lease was
 merely a vehicle for Harmon to enrich himself at the 
expense of TTR's investors.
  Harmon used the Four Seasons condo as his personal residence 
while 
at the same time 
maintaining an office 
at TTR's Lake Forest, IL headquarters.
 44. From June 2011 through t
he end of 2016, 
Narayan received at least $1.
5 million 
in misappropriated
 investor
 funds.
  Harmon directed TTR to pay these 
finder's 
fees to Narayan
 in 
exchange for Narayan directing his clients' funds to TTR.
  Ultimately, 
TTR redirected to
 Narayan 
over 5
% of the funds Narayan's advisory clients invested in TTR
. 45. In Harmon's words, these funds were ""turned around"" from Narayan's clients.  In 
                                                           3 Technically, the lease named Forward Markets Media

                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 10 of 31   PageID 2556 SEC

   an 
October 2014 e
-mail from Harmon to Narayan and Kaptrosky
, he cautioned
 that in order to 
make the
se payments ap
pear ""kosher,"" the men 
needed to be
 careful that they were not ""'turning 
around' more than 10%"" of the 
client funds.  Later, in a
 November 2014
 email
 from 
Harmon
 to 
Kaptrosky
, Harmon
 describes payments to Narayan
 as ""
Ash money in/money out.
""  And in 
January 2015, 
Harmon reiterated 
in an
 email to Narayan and Kaptrosky
 that ""[w]
e have 
addressed the matter of % amount of net funds wired back to [Narayan] before, and that number 
is 10%.
""  iii. The Defendants engaged in other deceptive conduct at pa
rt of the scheme.
 46. Aside from misappropriating over $
2 million from investors as part of the 
scheme, the Defendants also engaged in other deceptive conduct.  For instance, the Defendants 
tried to
 obscure
 the undisclosed finder's fees through the use of 
sham promissory notes
 or by 
mischaracterizing them as ""director fees
.""  They also backdated documents in order to allow 
TTR to survive annual audits.
  And they made Ponzi
-like payments
Šin which older investors 
were paid off using funds from newer investors
Što keep 
TTR from failing and thereby prolong 
the scheme
.  Finally, 
the Defendants enter
ed into an agreement under which Narayan redirect
ed fraud proceeds back to TTR to keep it afloat.
 47. As noted above, 
Narayan was regularly paid finder's fees
Šoften 
using client 
funds.
  At least in part because 
Narayan 
never
 disclose
d the 
finder
's fee
s to his
 clients, he, 
Harmon, and Kaptrosky knowingly or recklessly took affirmative s
teps to conceal the payments.  
 48. The TTR Board
Šwhich consisted of Narayan, Harmon
, and one other person
Švoted to pay Narayan $1 million as a ""director's fee.""
  During the SEC's investigation of this 
matter, 
Harmon testified that Narayan was the only one who received director's fees, and that the 
fact that Narayan was the source of as m
uch as 90% of TTR's capital was ""certainly"" a factor in 
                                                                                          Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 11 of 31   PageID 2557 SEC

   him receiving fees.
  Thus, the ""director's fees"" were nothing more than thinly
-veiled finder's fees.
 49. At other times, however
, the TTR payments to Narayan were no longer finder's 
fees or director's
 fees, but ""loans.""  This 
characterization
 had the additional effect of obscuring 
the finder's fees.  Th
e ""loans""
 began at least at early as 2011
.  50. At Narayan's and Harmon's direction and with their knowledge, Kaptrosky drafted 
promissory notes
 to memo
rialize the sham loans.
  They did this, at least in part, to survive TTR's 
annual audits.
  Each year, when Narayan had received additional undisclosed fees
Ševen after 
they exceed the $1 million ""director's fee
""ŠNarayan, Harmon, and Kaptrosky simply drafted
 a new 
promissory 
note reflecting the fees paid to date.
  These notes were sometimes backdated.  
All of the finder's fee payments were ultimately characterized as $1,848,000 in loans to Narayan. 
 51. In reality, the
se loans were a sham.  As Narayan, Harmon
, and Kaptrosky knew or 
were reckless in not knowing, the loan documents were designed to
: (1)
 allow TTR to survive its 
annual audits; (2) 
conceal the true nature of the payments to Narayan
; and (3) 
help Narayan 
avoid taxes.  At the very least, it was 
unreasonable for the Defendants to participate in this 
arrangement.
 52. Narayan never made a single payment on the ""loans"" until early 2016
Šwhen he 
had been dismissed by RGT and had become aware that he was being investigated by the SEC
.  At that time, TTR
 and Narayan entered into an agreement purportedly requiring him to 
finally 
repay the sham loans.  The agreement include
d a $1,000,000 setoff for the ""director's fees.""  This 
agreement 
was nothing more than an after
-the
-fact attempt to cover up the fraudul
ent conduct 
and to keep TTR afloat 
once
 the Narayan funding ha
d dried up.
 53. Narayan
 paid
 $350,000 under th
is agreement.  
These funds 
wer
e used to pay for 
TTR's ongoing expenses
Šincluding expenses and/or salaries for Harmon and Kaptrosky.
                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 12 of 31   PageID 2558 SEC
 v. Narayan, et al.

Complaint
   54. Harmon and 
Narayan directed
 TTR to make
 fraudulent Ponzi
-like
 payments
, in 
which older investments were paid off with funds from new investments
.  Examples include:
  on August 7
-8, 2014, a payment was made in which over $2.6 million in funds 
from 
Client Two 
and anothe
r Narayan client were sent to 
Client One
's wife;
  on January 9
-12, 2015, a payment was made in which $350,000 in funds from 
Client Two 
were sent to 
Client Three
;4 and
  On January 26
-27, 2016, a payment was made in which $2 million in funds from 
Client Three
 were sent to 
Client One
. 55. These fraudulent payments were made in order to prolong the scheme
Šboth 
because existing investors may have demanded their principal back if they had known TTR's true 
financial condition and because new investors would not hav
e invested.  This would have cut off 
TTR's lifeblood, the flow of new funds
.  For example, the August 2014 payment was made when 
Client One was demanding the proceeds of his TTR investments.  As Harmon and Narayan 
knew, TTR did not have sufficient funds.  
Thus, they arranged to pay off Client One with funds 
from Client Two.  Had they not done this, the scheme would have
 likely
 collapsed
Šwhich 
would have meant that they would have no longer been able to misappropriate money from TTR.
  56. Harmon
 knowingly, r
ecklessly, 
negligently, 
or unreasonably directed these 
fraudulent payments.  
TTR internal documents
Šincluding contemporaneous emails
Šshow that
 he directed Kaptrosky to 
make them, which Kaptrosky did
. 57. As part of the same transaction in which Client One 
was paid off with funds from 
Client Two, the Defendants
 created and executed backdated documents 
to prolong the scheme
.  In July 2014,
 with Client One demanding payment,
 Narayan directed 
Harmon and 
Kaptrosky to 
                                                           4 Narayan also received $92,500 of these funds.
                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 13 of 31   PageID 2559 SEC

Šbackdated to January 1, 2014
Šcovering 
Client One

Šsince 
Client One
 had not been repaid the millions TTR owed him.  Kaptrosky 
complied
Šcreating
 the 
backdated note, executing it on TTR's behalf, and send
ing it to Narayan for execution.
 58. Narayan
 ultimately
 transferred 
approximately
 $27 million
 in client funds to TTR 
from 
June 
2011 through December 20
16.  In many instances, he did this
 without
 his clients' 
knowledge or consent.  By doing this, 
Narayan abused his clients' trust and the discretion they 
gave him to manage their investments.  
For example, he repeatedly did this with investments he 
managed for Client One, Client Two, and Client Three.
 59. In the instances where the investments were authorized, the client agreed only to 
make a small investment.  In 
Client One
's case, he agreed in 2010 only to make a small 
investment in TTR of no more than $300,000.  
After that
, Narayan directed over $7 m
illion to 
TTR without 
Client One
's consent.
 60. Client Three
 agreed to invest only $100,000.  Instead, Narayan directed over $7 
million of 
Client Two
's funds to TTR.  
Since learning about the unauthorized investments, Client 
Three has confirmed that Naraya
n made the investments using signatures that were 
forged, 
faked, obtained without 
his
 knowledge
, or copied from other documents without 
his
 consent
. 61. Client Two
 never authorized a single TTR investment
Šand had never even heard 
of TTR until February 2016
.  It was at that time that 
Client One
 called 
Client Two
 to tell him that 
Narayan had been fired and that he had been making unauthorized investments in TTR.
  Client 
Two has since confirmed that Narayan made unauthorized investments in TTR using 
signatures
 that 
were forged, faked, or copied from other documents without 
Client Two's
 consent
.                                                                                           Case 3:16-cv-01417-M   Document 169   Filed 01/04/18    Page 14 of 31   PageID 2560 SEC

   III. THE 
DEFENDANTS MADE MATER
IAL MISREPRESENTATIO
NS TO INVESTORS DURI
NG THE 
COURSE OF CARRYING O
UT THE SCHEME
.  i. The Defendants misled investors regarding the true 
state of TTR's business
 and how investor funds would be spent
. 62. The Defendants portrayed TTR as a successful and profitable business.  But a
s the
y knew or were reckless in not knowing, 
TTR 
had
 been in severe financial distress for years.  
TTR's financia
l statements for 2012

 -$40,562,593 2015 -$3,252,336 Not 
available
 -$47,129,702  63. As the
 Defendants
 also knew or were reckless in not knowing, in 
both 2012 and 
2013, the company's
 external auditor issued an adverse opinion regarding 
TTR's
 ability to 
continue as a going concern
.  This reflected the
 auditor
's substantial doubt that TTR 
would be 
able to
 meet
 its current and future financial obligations.
  Harmon himself may have summarized 
TTR's financial condition best in a May 26, 2014 email to Narayan: ""To be sure our revenue 
sucks.  Our
 balance sheet is a disaster.""
 64. Only Narayan's ability to keep injecting investor funds into TTR kept it afloat.  As 
noted in 
TTR's 2012
-13 financial statement notes, which Narayan, Harmon, and Kaptrosky saw:

153,153,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut resident David S. Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors. Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC. Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012. He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds. According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad. Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors. The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of these laws. Haddad and Trafalgar also have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $619,382.43 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,131.83. Haddad and New England Re have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $269,080 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest $2,592.66. In addition, Haddad has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $181,071 and has consented to the imposition of a permanent bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company. Haddad further has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from providing information to, soliciting, or accepting investments or funds from any investor or potential investors regarding the offer or sale of any securities issued by any entity that he directly or indirectly owns, controls, consults for, or is employed by, unless he first provides such person with a written disclosure regarding his prior regulatory history and maintains written records of such disclosures.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ellen B. Moynihan, Deena R. Bernstein, Sofia T. Hussain, and Kevin B. Currid of the Boston Regional Office.","    1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
 A. Background Concerning 
Trafalgar
 12. Haddad worked for many years in various capacities in the re
-insurance business, 
a segment of the insurance industry 
in which
 multiple insurance companies share risk by 
purchasing insurance policies from other insurers to limit the total loss the original 
insurer would 
experience in case of catastrophic claims.
  In 2009, he 
founded Trafalgar as a 
purported 
sales 
underwriting consulting and marketing firm
 specializing in stop
-loss insurance,
 which is 
insurance
 purchased 
over and above employer self
-fund
ed insurance for catastrophic claims or 
high dollar claimants on employer
-sponsored employee benefit plans
.  Trafalgar claimed 
in 
a prospectus 
(a document intended to disclose details about an investment) 
that it
 ﬁrepresents the 
marketing on nearly $65 milli
on in stop loss business.ﬂ  
Haddad and Trafalgar generated revenue 
through commissions paid by stop
-loss insurance carriers and fees earned for services provided 
to managing general underwriters (ﬁMGUsﬂ)
, specialized insurance agent/brokers that are vested
 with underwriting authority by insurers and that perform various tasks including binding 
coverage, underwriting and pricing, and settling claims
.  During the period 2012 through 2016, 
Trafalgar typically earned commission and fee revenue of between $2 mil
lion and $3 million 
annually.
 Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 4 of 14    5 B. Haddad™s 
Personal
 Lifestyle and Financial Problems
  13. Trafalgar maintained an account at a financial institution for general business 
operation purposes (the ﬁTrafalgar business accountﬂ).  The company™s commission and fe
e revenue would typically be deposited into and maintained in that business account, and Trafalgar 
would pay its general business expenses using that account.  
Haddad spent money from the 
Trafalgar business account on 
personal 
expenditures 
such as real est
ate 
that cost
 over $5 million, 
art and antiques
 costing more than $1.78 million
, entertaining at his properties, landscaping, and 
cooking/cleaning/dog caretaker staff at 
several
 of his 
multiple 
homes.  Haddad also purchased 
a building for his dog rescue ch
arity 
and paid its expenses primarily
 with funds from the Trafalgar 
business account.  He spent little of 
the re
insurance fee and commission revenue 
earned by 
Trafalgar 
on legitimate 
expenses
 of the business
.   Although 
Haddad 
purportedly 
paid 
approximately 
$2.53 million
 in payroll 
to 46 individuals 
from the Trafalgar business account for 
the period September 2013 through 
August 2016
, only about $232,000 
was 
paid to three 
individuals 
who 
actually provided services in connection with the stated b
usiness of Trafalgar
.  The remaining payroll went to individuals who performed dog care and other services for 
Haddad™s dog rescue charity
, maintained Haddad™s homes, or worked directly for Haddad in a 
personal capacity. 
    14. Although Haddad 
and Trafalg
ar 
received 
over
 $9.9 million in commissions and 
fees 
from 
Trafalgar™s operations from 2012 to August 201
6, it was not sufficient to support his 
lifestyle.  
Haddad, Trafalgar, and 
Haddad™s dog rescue
 charity 
regularly paid their bills late, 
their 
bank acco
unts were frequently overdrawn and assessed
 insufficient funds charges, 
their 
retail 
and veterinary services accounts
 were repeatedly frozen
, and 
their 
property and other insurance 
policies
 were threatened with cancellation on multiple occasions
.  In addit
ion, Haddad, who has 
Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 5 of 14    6 poor credit, has purchase
d his homes through private mortgages and rent
-to-own arrangements
 and has not 
been able to get financing through 
conventional 
financial institutions. 
 In this time 
period, Haddad spent over $16 million from the Trafalgar business account, 
of which little more 
than one tenth, approximately 
$1.85 million
, was used
 for business expenses.  In order to fund 
his personal spending 
beyond the income he earned
 and had 
obtained through 
private mortgages 
and loans
, Haddad
 raised money from investors 
by falsely representing that their money would 
be used to grow 
Trafalgar™s business. 
 C. The Offer and Sale of Trafalgar Securities
 15. Beginning 
at least as 
early as
 2012, Haddad and Trafalgar made up the short
-fall
 between his income and spending
 by raising money 
from investors through the offer and sale of 
securities
.  Initially 
these securities took the form 
of promissory and other notes.
  Haddad and 
Trafalgar issued 
at l
east 
19 notes that ranged in term length from one to five years, with interest 
rates between 12% and 15%.  Several of the notes provided an option for the investor to ﬁroll 
over the–principle [sic] investment for another 3 years.ﬂ
 16. In 
June 2015, Haddad and 
Trafalgar began to offer and sell ﬁprivate equity 
investmentsﬂ in Trafalgar
.  Beginning in July 2015, 
Haddad 
sold ﬁ
shares
ﬂ of Trafalgar as well.  
Four investors purchased securities through the ﬁprivate equity investmentﬂ vehicle, 
while 
five 
investors purc
hased shares of Trafalgar
. 17. Through these sales of securities, Trafalgar raised at least $1,189,125 from April 
2012 through August 2016
 from at least 19 investors located in at least five different states, 
including Connecticut, Rhode Island, California, 
Illinois, and Florida
.    Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 6 of 14    7 D. Haddad and Trafalgar Misled Trafalgar Investors
 Regarding Their Finances 
and Use of Investor Proceeds
  18. Haddad and Trafalgar made multiple material misstatements and omissions in 
connection with their offer and sale of Trafalgar
 securities.  
In multiple instances, 
Haddad told 
investors that he was raising funds to support the operations and growth of Trafalgar and to hire 
additional salespeople.  
However,
 Trafalgar did not have significant overhead 
expenses that 
requi
red
 funds
 beyond
 the 
commissions and fees it earned, and 
Haddad 
did not take any steps to 
grow the company™s sales force.  
 19. Haddad and Trafalgar 
omitted to
 tell prospective investors that Haddad would be 
spending their money, in significant part, 
on homes, antiques, a
rt, a dog rescue 
charity
, and other 
non-business
-related expenditures.  H
addad
 boasted to investors about how successful Trafalgar 
was and 
omitted
 to 
disclose to 
investors 
and prospective investors 
the financial difficulties 
caused by his spending habits
, including the fact that he
 and Trafalgar frequently overdrew the 
Trafalgar
 account
s.  20. Haddad™s regular depletion of the funds in the Trafalgar business account meant 
that he and Trafalgar had to raise additional money from investors to make principal and i
nterest 
payments to other investors and to cover Haddad™s other current and delinquent debts.  Haddad 
and Trafalgar did not tell prospective investors and investors that funds raised from investors 
were being used, in part, to make payments to other invest
ors.
 21. Haddad and Trafalgar made additional misrepre
sentations and omissions in the 
documents they provided to investors. Haddad and Trafalgar provided multiple prospective 
investors with a prospectus that touted Trafalgar™s financial success without disclos
ing any of its 
or Haddad™s financial woes.  The prospectus 
and investor agreements 
also misleadingly stated 
that Trafalgar was offering guaranteed interest 
yields in rates 
varying from 8% to 1
5%, when in 
Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 7 of 14    8 fact Haddad knew 
or should have known 
that Trafalgar
 could not make such guaranteed returns 
without raising money from additional investors.
  E. New England RE and Its Offer and Sale of Securities
 22. In 2014, Haddad 
co-founded
 New England RE purportedly to operate as a re
-insurer that would
 market, 
underwrite, and bind stop
-loss insurance coverage to self
-insured 
employers
.  In December 2014, Haddad and New England RE began offering and selling 
New 
England RE 
securities
, telling
 prospective investors that they were raising funds to build the new 
busi
ness and fund the company™s capital and surplus reserves.  
 23. Haddad and New England RE sold 
securities described as ﬁ
Class A
ﬂ and 
ﬁClass 
Bﬂ shares and, in the case of one investor, a promissory note that gave the investor the right to 
con
vert the investment
 to shares.  
From February 2015 through November 15, 2015, New 
England RE and Haddad raised at least $1,330,388 from 16 investors
 from at least nine different 
states, including Connecticut, California, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Michigan, 
Tennessee, and New Hampshire
.  During that same period, New England RE brought in 
approximately $350,000 in re
-insurance fees.
  The 
agreements between New England RE and 
investors
 offered varying amounts of returns on investments, with some purporting to g
uarantee 
a rate of return of between 1
0-12% per quarter
.  F. Haddad and New England RE Made False and Misleading Statements in 
Written Disclosures to Investors
 24. The New England RE prospectus, which Haddad provided to potential investors
, contained multiple 
misstatements and omitted to disclose information
 that 
was necessary to make 
the prospectus™ statements were not misleading.
 25. Although the prospectus 
stated that New England RE was ﬁseeking investors to 
fund approximately $1,450,000 in working funds and 
statutory capital,
ﬂ it did not inform 
Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 8 of 14    9 investors that
, in actuality
, New England RE was lending significant amounts of money 
Œ ultimately a total of at least $373,000 
Œ to Trafalgar, which
 spent the
 money on, among other 
things, paying Haddad™s non
-business
-related expenses and 
making
 interest pa
yments to 
Trafalgar investors.
 26. Although
 the
 New England RE
 prospectus represented that the funds were to be 
used to fund 
the business of 
New England R
E, it failed to disclose that
, in actuality,
 Haddad and 
Trafalgar 
had New England RE  guarantee at least one Trafalgar investor™s principal and interest.  
 27. The New England RE prospectus also contained 
the misleading statement that 
Haddad was 
ﬁof financial soundness.ﬂ  
This representation 
was false and materially incomple
te 
in 
in light of 
the precarious state of Haddad™s finances, including his substantial indebtedness, 
his 
frequently delinquent debt
 payment
s, and 
his 
poor credit
.  Far from being ﬁfinancially sound,ﬂ 
Haddad and his entity Trafalgar 
had borrowed money 
from 
New England RE to
, among other 
things, make payments to Trafalgar investors
 and to support Haddad™s lavish lifestyle
. 28. Haddad and New England RE also failed to 
correct 
these material 
misstatements 
and material omissions 
in any other written or oral communic
ation
 with investors
.  29. Haddad made an additional 
false and misleading statement
 to at least one New 
England RE investor
 by telling the investor in an email that Haddad would not draw a salary 
from New England RE
.  In actuality, 
New England RE paid Haddad $
125,000 in consulting fees 
and paid Trafalgar $25,500 in consulting and marketing fees.
 30. In the same email exchange, the prospective investor 
asked 
how much money ha
d been raised.  Haddad responded ﬁapproximately $1,000,000
.ﬂ   In fact, he and New England R
E had only raised approximately $600,000 as of the time of the email.
 Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 9 of 14    10 31. Haddad 
and
 New England RE further misled investors regarding the specifics of 
New England RE™s securities offerings
 and the resulting 
ownership structure
 of the company.
  The Investor Agreement with one investor who purchased Class A shares in October 2015 
represented 
that only four investors (including the three founders) owned more than 1% of the 
total Class A shares
.  In actuality, 
Haddad and 
New England RE 
had sold share
s to two 
additional investors in March 2015 
in blocks 
that constituted 10% and 2.5%, respectively, of the 
total Class A authorized shares.
 32. In January 2015, 
Haddad sent a potential New England RE investor an email 
representing 
that Class B share purchases w
ere capped at 15 shares 
for calendar year
 2015.  In 
actuality, Haddad 
and New England RE 
sold 
30 Class B shares to another investor 
shortly 
thereafter
.  The investor 
sent Haddad a follow
-up email on 
March 15, 2015 
specifically asking 
Haddad to verify that 
he would be obtaining 2.5 Class B shares of New England RE through his 
investment and that there were a total of 10,000 Class B shares authorized.
  Haddad 
falsely 
confirmed the investor™s understanding 
even though he and New England RE 
had 
executed other 
investor agreements
, both several days prior to and several days after that 
email
, stating, 
variously, that 150,000, 20,000, and 1,000 Class B shares had been authorized
.   G. 
 Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE Engaged in a Ponzi
-Like Scheme
 33. The materia
l misstatements and omissions by Haddad, Trafalgar, and New 
England RE were part of a larger scheme 
that they 
perpetrated
 with an aim of
 keep
ing
 Haddad 
afloat financially as he chronically spent well beyond his financial means
.  Part of the scheme 
was 
to 
create and support the illusion that Haddad was financially successful enough to sustain 
his lavish lifestyle.
 Case 3:18-cv-00055   Document 1   Filed 01/11/18   Page 10 of 14    11 34. Haddad and his entities engaged in a continuous practice of raising and spending 
investor money in Ponzi
-like fashion 
(making payments to earlier
 investors with money obtained 
from new investors) 
that helped to mask what was actually being done with 
investors™ 
money 
and helped mask Haddad™s and Trafalgar™s true financial circumstances
.  On several occasions
 when the Trafalgar business account had
 a low balance,
 Haddad sought and obtained funds from 
investors in Trafalgar
 to pay his personal expenses
 without disclosing the true purpose of the 
funds
.  Haddad also indirectly used monies raised from 
New England RE investors
 to fund his 
personal expens
es by causing
 New England RE to 
lend 
Trafalgar 
money and to pay 
compensation 
to Haddad and Trafalgar.  
On these occasions, after transferring funds from 
a bank 
account in the name of 
New England RE to the Trafalgar business account, Haddad 
quickly 
spent th
e money 
to make payments to other investors, to make purchases and payments that 
supported his lifestyle, and otherwise to spend the funds on expenses unrelated to the business 
operations of Trafalgar or New England RE.  Absent the inflow of these funds fr
om investors, 
Haddad would not have been able to make those non
-business
-related payments and pu
rchases.

154,154,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action on January 2, 2018, alleging that an Atlanta, Georgia-based municipal advisor and its principal defrauded the City of Rolling Fork, Mississippi and failed to disclose certain related-party payments in connection with a municipal bond offering.

In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, the SEC alleges that Malachi Financial Products, Inc. (""Malachi""), a Georgia corporation, and its principal, Porter B. Bingham of Roswell, Georgia, fraudulently overcharged Rolling Fork for municipal advisory services related to an October 2015 municipal bond offering. Malachi is registered as a municipal advisor with both the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (""MSRB""). According to the complaint, after the offering closed, Malachi and Bingham submitted two invoices to the bond trustee for payment. The SEC alleges that one of those invoices was fraudulent, because it was for services that Malachi and Bingham did not perform and the city did not authorize. The complaint also alleges that Bingham failed to disclose to the city that he had accepted payments totaling $2,500 from Anthony Stovall, an employee of a municipal underwriter, shortly before he and Malachi recommended that the city hire Stovall's firm to underwrite the bond offering. The complaint alleges that the city ultimately hired that underwriting firm based on Bingham and Malachi's recommendation. Finally, the complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingham violated their fiduciary duty to the city.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingham violated Sections 15B(a)(5) and 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint further alleges that both defendants violated MSRB Rule G-17, which requires municipal advisors to deal fairly with their clients. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and other relief against both defendants.

In separate administrative proceedings, the Commission entered a settled Administrative Order against Stovall.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Justin Delfino and supervised by Peter J. Diskin, both of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Edward Sullivan and Mr. Delfino and supervised by M. Graham Loomis of the Atlanta Regional Office. An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Nadine Sophia Evans of the National Exam Program and Kee Han of the Atlanta Regional Office."," 1IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Defendants.
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
The plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this 
Complaint and alleges the following:
SUMMARY
1.This action concerns misconduct by a m
unicipal advisor and its principal in 
connection with a $1.1 million bond offering by th
e City of Rolling Fork, Mississippi (ﬁRolling 
Forkﬂ or theﬁCityﬂ).
2.In January 2015, the City hired Defendan
t Malachi Financial Products, Inc. 
(ﬁMalachiﬂ) to serve as its municipal adviso
r for a contemplated bond offering. Malachiis 
owned and controlled by Defendant 
Porter B. Bingham(ﬁBinghamﬂ).
3.In May 2015, Bingham accepted two payments totaling $2,500 from AnthonyA. 
Stovall (ﬁStovallﬂ), a registered representative who was associated with a broker-dealer and 

municipal securities dealer Bonwick Capital Partners, LLC(ﬁBonwickﬂ).
3:18-cv-1-HSO-LRACase 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 1 of 15 24.Approximately two weeks after receiving those payments,a Malachi employee 
recommended that the City hire Bonwick to under
write the anticipated bond offering. In June 
2015, the City hired Bonwick to underwrite the of
fering. Neither Bingha
m nor Stovall disclosed the payments or the resulting conflicts of interest to theCity.
5.After the bond offering closed in October 2015, Bingham directed a Malachi 
employee to submit two invoices for municipal 
advisory services to
 the bond trustee for 
payment.
6.The first invoice, for $22,000, was consiste
nt with the written agreementbetween 
Malachi and the City, which provided that the Ci
ty would pay no more than 2% of the total 
offeringamount.
7.The second invoice, for $33,000, purported to 
be for additional services thatwere 
not part of the original agreement. In fact, 
the second invoice was fraudulent because Malachi 
did not provide the purported additional services 
and the City did not authorize or agree to the 
additionalcharges.
8.Although both invoices were addressed to 
the Mayor of the City, Malachi did not 
provide them to the Mayor or anyone else at th
e City before payment. Thus, the City was not 
aware of the fraudulent overcharge until after the bond trustee paid theinvoice.
VIOLATIONS
9.As a result of this conduct, Malachi and 
Bingham violated Sections 15B(a)(5) and 
15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77o-4(a)(5) 
and 78o-4(c)(1)] and Municipal Secur
ities Rulemaking Board (ﬁMSRBﬂ) Rule G-17 thereunder, 
and Bingham aided and abetted 
Malachi™s violations of thes
e provisions. The Commissionseeks

14.Malachi Financial Products, Inc.
(ﬁMalachiﬂ) is a Georgia corporationformed
in 2005 and located in Roswell, Georgia. Malach

2014, Malachi registered with the Commission and

municipal advice.15.Porter B. Bingham
, age 56, of Roswell, Georgia has been president andsole
shareholder of Malachi since its formation. Prio
r to forming Malachi, Bingham was a registered 
representative with several different broker-dealers. Bingham held Series 7, 24 and 63securities 

licenses. The last firm that Bingham was regi
stered with was The Malachi Group, Inc., (ﬁThe 
Malachi Groupﬂ) a registered broker-dealer
 he owned and contro
lled. The Malachi Group, 
which ceased operations more than a decade ago, predated Malachi, and is a completely separate 

entity. In August 2007, the Financial Industry Re
gulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ), via a consent 
agreement, suspended Bingham as a general securities principal for a period of one year and 
fined him $10,000 for various net capital violations 
by The Malachi Group and for failing to file 
The Malachi Group™s annual audit report in a time
ly manner. In turn, The Malachi Group was 
sanctioned on eight occasions for a variety of compliance issues and for failing to maintain the 

proper net capital amount. In 2006, The Malach
i Group was expelled from the then National 
Association of Securities Dealer
s (ﬁNASDﬂ), which is now known as FINRA, for failing to pay 
fines and its broker-dealer registration wascancelled.
16.Previously, Malachi had filed Form MA
-I with the Commission establishing 
Bingham as a person associated with a municipal 
advisory firm. However, because Binghamdid 
not take or pass the Series 50 
municipal advisor exam by the requisite deadline, pursuant to 
MSRB Rule G-3, he is not permitted to act as an associated person of a municipal advisor or 

provide municipaladvice.

Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 5 of 15 6FACTS
A.The City of Rolling Fork Hired Malachi to Provide Municipal Advisory 
Services for its BondOffering
22.In late 2014, Rolling Fork, a small munici
pality with a population of just over 
2,000, sought to raise funds for certain improveme
nt projects. These projects included paving 
streets and public parking areas, repairing muni
cipal buildings, and constructing a municipal 
swimmingpool.
23.In January 2015, Rolling Fork hired Malachi as the municipal advisor fora
proposed bond offering to fund the nece
ssary improvements (theﬁOfferingﬂ).
24.The City and Malachi entered into an 
ﬁAgreement for Professional Financial 
Advisory Servicesﬂ (ﬁMA Agreementﬂ). Bingham, as Malachi™s president and soleprincipal, 

signed the MA Agreement on behalf of Malach
i. Under the terms of the MA Agreement, 
Malachi was to be paid an amount not to exceed 2% of the debtissuance.
B.Bingham and Malachi Recommended that the CityHire Stovall and 
Bonwick Without Disclosing Stovall™s Recent Payments toBingham
25.Bingham and Stovall have known each other since 2004. Between 2005 and 
2013, Stovall and Bingham had worked together pr
oviding underwriting and municipal advisory 
services, respectively, to municipal is
suers in approximately 15 bondofferings.
26.In late May 2015, Stovall provided Bi
ngham with a total of $2,500 intwo 
separatepayments.
27.Specifically, on or about May 22, 2015, Stova
ll directed a family member to 
write a check for $2,000 from an account on which Stovall was not a signatory.  That check was 

made payable to ﬁcash MFP, LLC.ﬂ  MFP, LLC, which Bingham controlled, is a defunct 

corporation Bingham formed in 2010.  Bingham deposited the check in an MFP , LLC account on 

May 26, 2-15.
Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 6 of 15 728.A few days later, on May 28, Stovall dir
ected the family member to wire an 
additional $500 from the same account to a 
different MFP, LLC bank account.     
29.In each case, the checks were deposited just in time to allow Bingham to avoid a 
negative balance in eachaccount.
30.Bingham used the funds for personal and business purposes.
31.A few weeks after these payments were received, at a June 2015 meeting of the 
Rolling Fork Board of Aldermen, aMalachi employee, at Bingham™s instruction,recommended 

that Rolling Fork hire Stovall and Bonwick to underwrite theOffering.
32.Stovall than made a presentation at the m
eeting in which he describedBonwick™s 
capabilities and pastperformance.
33.The Malachi representative did not recommend or introduce anyother 
underwriting firms for the City toconsider.
34.Based in part on Malachi™s recommendation, Rolling Fork™s Board ofAlderman 
voted to hire Stovall andBonwick.
35.Neither the Malachi representative nor Stovall disclosed to the City that Stovall 
had paid Bingham $2,500 only a few weeksearlier.
C.Malachi and Bingham Overcharged the City for Municipal Advisory 
Services
36.The City™s Offering was originally contemplated to be for $2million.
37.Due to the City™s statutory offering limits, however, Rolling Fork was requiredto 
reduce the size of the Offering to $1.1million.
38.This meant that, under the terms of the 
MA Agreement, Malachi™s compensation 
(2% of the total offering amount) was reduced from $40,000 to$22,000.
Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 7 of 15 839.Malachi and Bingham attempted to rec
oup this lost revenue by fraudulently 
charging the City for purported ﬁadditional services
ﬂ in connection with the Offering that they 
did not actuallyprovide.
40.On October 15, 2015, the day after the Offering closed, Bingham directed 
Malachi™s employee to prepare and send tw
o invoices totaling $55,000 to the bond trusteefor 
payment.
41.One invoice was for $22,000, which was Ma
lachi™s contractual fee forthe 
municipal advisory services provided to 
Rolling Fork (2% of the $1.1 millionissuance).
42.The other invoice was for $33,000 and, accord
ing to the invoice, was purportedly 
for services related to the 
ﬁinvestment of bondproceeds.ﬂ
43.This invoice was false and fraudulent and wa
s not authorized or agreed to bythe
City.
44.Although both invoices were addressed to
 the Mayor of Rolling Fork, Malachi 
only transmitted them to the bond trustee and never 
sent them to the Mayor or the City. As a 
result, the bond trustee paid the full $55,000 to Malachi before Rolling Fork became aware of the 

invoices.45.Malachi provided no services relating to 
the investment of bond proceeds to the 
City of Rolling Fork. Additionally, the bond proceed
s had not, in fact, been invested by thetime 
of the secondinvoice.
46.Neither Bingham nor Malachi has any doc
umentation reflecting any investment 
services they purportedly provided the City in
 connection with the proceeds from theOffering.
Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 8 of 15 947.Although Malachi and Bingham may have
 also created some post-bondissuance 
compliance policies for the City and examined the City tax rolls to determine the City™s legal 

lending limit, neither of those services, ev
en if provided, justified the $33,000invoice.
48.The post-issuance compliance policies that Malachi and Bingham purportedly 
created for the City contained nothing but standa
rd boilerplate language
, much of which canbe 
found merely by doing an internet search. As su
ch, it would have been unreasonable to billthe 
City $33,000 for preparing these policies. More
 importantly, Malach
i and Bingham never 
provided those written policies to theCity.
49.Although Malachi and Bingham did a 
minimal amount of work to examine 
Rolling Fork™s property tax rolls to calculate the City™s legal debt limit, those services were 
already contemplated by th
e MA Agreement and thus do not support the additionalinvoice.
50.The MA Agreement provided that Malachi would ﬁhelp . . . determine an issue 
amount,ﬂ assist with ﬁstructuring the issue,ﬂ a
nd ﬁadvis[e] on other matters
 related to theCity™s 
debt and capital plans.ﬂ Calculation of the City™s debt limit was clearly necessary to determine 

the issue amount and is a typical task that a 
municipal advisor would undertake as part of a 
general obligationoffering.
51.Moreover, the minimal amount of work pe
rformed on thistask would not justifya
$33,000 invoice, as Malachi spent only between 
three and five hours working on the tax 
valuation issue.Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 9 of 15 10COUNT IŠFRAUDULENT PRACTICES BY A MUNICIPAL ADVISOR

155,155,"The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered Final Judgment in a Securities and Exchange Commission case against California-based attorney Owen H. Naccarato for violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.

The SEC's complaint alleges that in September 2013, Naccarato issued two opinion letters pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") improperly concluding that Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (""Global Digital""), a Florida-based microcap company, was not a shell company and that certain shareholders were not affiliates of Global Digital. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Naccarato improperly instructed Global Digital's transfer agent to remove the restrictive legends from these shareholder certificates. Many of the shares were then sold in unregistered public distributions.

Naccarato consented to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commission's complaint. The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Naccarato from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and orders him to pay $1,000 in disgorgement, $127.77 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.

The Final Judgment also prohibits Naccarato, for a period of five years, from directly or indirectly providing, or receiving compensation from the provision of, professional legal services to any person or entity in connection with the offer or sale of securities pursuant to, or claiming, an exemption under Section 4(a)(1) predicated on Securities Act Rule 144, or any other exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, including, without limitation, participating in the preparation or issuance of any opinion letter related to such offering or sale.

)    ) 
 COMPLAINT
  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows: 
 INTRODUCTION
  1. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Owen H. Naccarato, a 
California licensed attorney, from further viol
ations of the registration provisions of the 
federal securities laws. 
2. Global Digital Solutions, Inc. 
(ﬁGlobal
 Digitalﬂ)
 engaged Naccarato to 
provide various securities related legal se
rvices. On two instan
ces on Septem
ber 18, 2013, Naccarato authored opinion letters recommending 
the removal of restrictive legends from 
stock certificates for Global Digital representing 2,000,000 shares. These letters inaccurately 

opined that Global Digital had never been a shell company, that certain shareholders were not 

affiliates of Global Digital, and that these 
shareholders™ proposed sales of Global Digital stock 
complied with the requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ).
 3.  As a result, Naccarato instructed Global 
Digital™s
 transfer agent to remove 
the restrictive legends from these shareholder certificates, thus allowing the shares to 
become free trading and subsequently sold. But for the opinion letters, the transfer agent 
Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 1 of 9 2  would not have been allowed to issue the stock without a restrictive legend, and thereby 
facilitated their stock sale. 
4. By reason of the foregoi
ng, Naccarato violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of 
the Securities Act 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c), and should be permanently enjoined from 

future violations of the registration 
provisions of the Securities Act.  
DEFENDANT
  5. Naccarato resides in Irvine, California. He is a corporate and securities 
attorney licensed to practice in the State of Ca
lifornia and is the sole partner at Naccarato & 
Associates. 
Naccarato™s
 law practice provides securities related services to companies, often 
assisting them with matters before the Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory 

Authority (FINRA). He also has served in various corporate capacities for small public 

issuers. 
RELATED PARTY
  6. Global Digital is incorporated in New Jersey, with its principal place of 
business located in West Palm
 Beach, Florida. Global Digital purports to be in the 
ﬁcyber
 arms manufacturingﬂ
 and 
ﬁsecurity
 technology 
solutionsﬂ
 industry. Global 
Digital™s
 common 
stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities 

Exchange Act of 1934 
(ﬁExchange
 Actﬂ)
. Its stock is quoted on the OTC Link marketplace 
for trading over-the- counter stocks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker 
symbol 
ﬁGDSI.ﬂ
 Global 
Digital™s
 stock is a 
ﬁpenny
 stockﬂ
 under the federal securities laws.  
During the relevant time period, Global Digita
l operated out of a ﬁvirtual officeﬂ and had 
limited 
operations, no products, no sales, no revenues, and no assets outside of cash. On August 4, 
2016, the Commission brought an action to enjoin Global Digital, its former Chairman and 
Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 2 of 9 3  CEO, and its former CFO from violating the an
ti-fraud and reporting provisions of the federal 
securities laws, and against the former Chairm
an and CEO and former CFO from violating 
the certification and filing provisions of the federal securities  
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
 7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 
20(d)(1), 20(g), and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1), 77t(g), and 
77v(a). 
8. The Court has personal jurisdiction over 
the Defendant, and venue is proper in 
the Southern District of Florida, because certain of the 
Defendant™
s acts and transactions 
constituting violations of the Securities Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. 

Specifically, Naccarato directed documents and e
mails to individuals located in the District. 
In addition, at all relevant 
times, Global Digital engaged Naccarato as its attorney while 
having its principal place of business in the Southern District of Florida. 
9. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendant, 
directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or 
communication in interstate commerce, or the mails. 
RULE 144 SAFE HARBOR
  10. The Securities Act requires that if any person sells a non-exempt security to 
any other person, the sale must be registered
 with the Commission absent an applicable 
exemption. 
11. Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act provides one such exemption for a 
transaction 
ﬁby
 any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or 
dealer.ﬂ
 Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 3 of 9 4  12. An ﬁunderwriter,ﬂ
 as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, is 
any person who has purchased from an issuer w
ith a view to, or offers or sells for an 
issuer in connection with, the distribution of an
y security, or participates, or has a direct 
or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in 

the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking.  
13.  Rule 144 of the Securities Act creates a safe harbor from the Section 
2(a)(11) definition of 
ﬁunderwriter.ﬂ
 A person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 
144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engage
d in a distribution of the securities and 
therefore not an 
ﬁunderwriterﬂ
 of the securities for purposes of Section 2(a)(11). Therefore, 
such a person is deemed not to be an unde
rwriter when determining whether a sale is 
eligible for the Section 4(a)(1) exemption. 
14. Under Rule 144(b)(1)(i), if the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a 
period of at least 90 days immediately before 
the sale, subject to the reporting requirements 
of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, any pe
rson who is not an affiliate of the issuer at 
the time of the sale, and has not been an af
filiate during the preceding three months, who 
sells restricted securities of the issuer for his 
or her own account shall be deemed not to be an 
ﬁunderwriterﬂ
 of those securities within the meaning of
 Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act 
if all the conditions of certain other provisions in Rule 144 are met. 
15. Thus, if a person is not deemed an 
ﬁaffiliate,ﬂ
 defined in Rule 144 as a person 
that directly, or indirectly through one or more 
intermediaries controls, or is controlled by, or 
is under common control with, such issuer, then such person, consistent with the 

specifications of Rule 144(b)(1)(i), may sell unrestricted securities as that person is not 
deemed an 
ﬁunderwriter.ﬂ
 Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 4 of 9 5  16. Rule 144(i)(1)(ii) states that Rule 144 is not available to securities issued by an 
issuer that has been ﬁat any time previouslyﬂ a reporting or non
-reporting shell company.  Rule 
405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-
2 of the Exchange Act define ﬁshell companyﬂ as a 
company with ﬁ[n]o or nominal operationsﬂ a
nd either [n]o or nominal assets; [a]ssets 
consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or [a]ssets consisting of any amount of cash and 

cash equivalents and 
nominal other assets.ﬂ
 17. No other exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act existed for the sales of 
the Global Digital stock at issue in this Complaint.  
 DEFENDA 
NT™S VIOLATIVE 
CONDUCT 
  18. On two occasions on September 18, 2013, Naccarato, engaged as Global 
Digital™s
 outside counsel during this time, failed to note that Global Digital was a shell 
company, and failed to note the affiliate status of the requesting shareholders, thus 

incorrectly deeming them eligible for unlegended shares.  No registration statement was 
filed or in effect at the time Naccarato author
ed these opinion letters instructing Global 
Digital™s
 transfer agent to issue certificates without restrictive legends in these two 
instances. But for these opinion letters, Global 
Digital™s
 transfer agent would not have 
issued Global Digital stock certificates without restrictive legends, and the owner of these 

shares would not have been able to sell them.  
A. Naccar
ato™s
 First Inaccurate Affiliate Designation
  19. On September 18, 2013, Naccarato author
ed a Rule 144 safe harbor opinion 
letter removing the restrictive legend from 1,500,000 of Global Digital shares owned by 
Shareholder A, daughter of Executive X. However, Naccarato knew that Shareholder A was 
the daughter of Executive X (Global 
Digital™s
 then Executive Vice-President) and that the 
Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 5 of 9 6  shares had been gifted to her from her father
. Despite this knowledge, Naccarato authored an 
opinion letter stating that she was a non-affiliate and complied with Rule 
144™s safe harbor 
provisions. Naccarato never spoke to Shareholder 
A directly.  Executive X requested and paid 
for the letter. Days after Naccarato issued th
is opinion letter, Global Digital sold 
Shareholder 
A™s freely transferable shares to raise 
additional capital for its operations.  
Global Digital subsequently issued additional Global Digital stock to Shareholder A to 

replace the shares sold. 
 B. Nacca
rato™s
 Second Inaccurate Affiliate Designation 
20. Also on September 18, 2013, Naccarato au
thored an opinion letter removing 
the restrictive legend from 500,000 of Global Digital shares owned by Shareholder B, the 
19-year-old son of Executive Y at Global 
Digital. Naccarato knew Shareholder B was the 
son of Global 
Digital™s
 CEO at the time, and that the stock had been gifted to him by his 
father. Despite this knowledge,
 and despite never having spoken to Shareholder B, Naccarato 
authored an opinion letter, which was virtually identical to the Shareholder A letter, stating 
that Shareholder B was a non-affiliate and complied with Rule 
144™s
 safe harbor provisions. 
21. Days after Naccarato issued this opinion letter Global Digital sold 
Shareholder 
B™s
 freely transferable shares to raise additional capital for its operations. Global 
Digital subsequently issued additional Global Digital stock to Shareholder B to replace 

the shares sold. 
22. In his two opinion letters, Naccarato in
accurately concluded that the Global 
Digital shares could be issued without restrictive legends.  Naccarato ignored red flags 
concerning the sharehold
ers™ likely affiliate status.  The 
shareholders all controlled or were 
controlled by Global Digital and its senior exec
utives.  Finally, Global Digital was a shell 
Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 6 of 9 7  company within the meaning of Rule 144(i) because it operated 
out of a ﬁvirtual office,ﬂ had
 limited operations, no products, no sales, no revenues,
 and nominal assets (consisting solely of 
cash).  23. Global Digital raised $495,000 from 
the sale of Shareholder A™s and 
Shareholder 
B™s
 freely transferable shares, as a result of the two inaccurate affiliate 
designations.  At least one of the purchasers of 
the shares in this transaction sold the shares 
without an applicable exemption. 
CLAIM FOR RELIEF
  Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act
  24. The Commission repeats and realleges Paragr
aphs 1 through 23 of this Complaint. 
25. No registration statement was filed or in effect with the Commission pursuant 
to the Securities Act with respect to the securities and transactions described in this 

Complaint and no exemption from registration existed with respect to these securities and 
transactions. 
26. On or about September 18, 2013 the Defendant, a substantial factor and necessary 
participant in the unregistered sale of Global Digital™s securities,
 directly and indirectly: 
 (a)
 Made use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in 
interstate commerce or of the mails to sell securities as described herein, 

through the use or medium of a prospectus or otherwise; 
 (b) Carried securities or caused such secu
rities, as described herein, to be 
carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or

 being in effect with the Commission 
as to such securities. 
Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 7 of 9 8   27. By reason of the foregoing, Naccarat
o violated and, unless enjoined, is 
reasonably likely to continue to violate, Sectio
ns 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c).
