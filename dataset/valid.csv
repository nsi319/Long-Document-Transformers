During. tl~e Relevant Period, Rashid was a Partner and later a Senior Partner atApollo Mallageinent, L.P. {""A~ollo""), a multi-billion dollar investment adviser registered withthe Commission.

Over the Relevant Period, Rashid fraudulently charged more than one thousandpersonal items and services to the private equity funds that he advised. In 2010, for example,Rashid sought over ~ 1,100 in reimbursement from two private equity funds by falsely claimingthat the charbes were for business-related meals. In fact, Rashid sought the $1,100 to cover thecost of his visits to a hair salon. Later in 2010, Apollo discovered that Rashid charged these Šand other Špersonal expenses to the private equity funds that he advised, and required Rashid torepay these expenses. But Apollo took no specific steps to ensure that Rashid did not againmisappropriate their clients' funds.5. Despite Apollo's knowledge of Rashid's unlawful conduct, Rashid continued toimproperly charge person~~l expenses to the private equity fur7ds that he and Apollo advised. .Forexample, he charbeci expenses for several personal vacations to private equity funds that headvised, including intenlational vacations with his family for holidays acid trips to attend hisfriends' weddings.6. Rashid knew that 11is conduct was wrong, and lie took active steps to conceal it.In 2012, for example, after his administrative assistant questioned whether Rashid's $3,500chaz-ge at a high-end men's clothing store was business related, Rashid falsified a receipt toCase 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 2 of 28 justify the expense as business-related holiday gifts for executives of companies in which thefunds invested, when, in fact, Rashid had spent that money on a suit for his father.Apollo discovered Rashid's attempt to charge two of the private equity funds for'~~~, ~-ather's suit before it was charged to the funds, and required Rashid to repay that expense toApollo, along with other personal expenses that Rashid admitted he c}iarged to the funds headvised. Despite Apollo's additional discoveries, Rashid continued to charge thousands ofdollars of his personal expenses to funds he advised.8. After an extensive intenlal investigation into Rashid's expense issues andRashid's repayment of approximately $290,000 in personal expenses Rashid had charged toclients, Apollo entered into a separation agreement with Rashid effective February 2014.VIOLATIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT9.

Apollo has been registered with the Commissioi~7 as an investment adviser since2007. Along with certain of its affiliated advisers, Apollo manages more than .x,46 billion inassets.24. Since being registered as an investment adviser, Apollo has managed multipleprivate equity funds that invest in distressed or undervalued companies with the goal of laterexiting the investments for a profit. The companies in which Apollo's private equity fundsinvest are referred to as ""portfolio companies.""Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 7 of 28 25. During the Relevant Period, Rashid was an investment adviser to Apollo's privateequity funds. At the beginning of the Relevant Period, Rashid was a Partner at Apollo, and by2012, Apollo promoted him to Senior Partner. During the Relevant Period, Rashid was a~:r~ember of the private equity investment group and advised the Relevant Fuilds. Specifically,Rashid sourced, evaluated, and recommended investment opportunities to the Relevant Funds aswell as monitored the perfoi-marlce of investments made by the private equity funds and, whenappropriate, developed and recommended disposition strategies. He regularly participated inweekly meetings that took place amongst the investment professionals in the private equitygroup, where they discussed and determined, anlong other things, potential investments for theprivate equity funds ar~d the disposition of investments in those funds, including the RelevantFunds.2b. As described in a private placement memorandum for ANRP, for example,Apollo stated that Rashid `'leads [Apollo's] efforts in metals and mining and has helped generate,evaluate and execute a majority of [Apollo's] transactions in the sector.""27. Rashid further monitored the Relevant Funds' portfolio companies andimplemented plans to enhance their financial performance. He also conducted due diligence todetermine when and how the Relevant Funds could profitably liquidate or reduce theirŁ ownershipinterests in the portfolio companies they owned. Rashid served as a member of the boards ofdirectors of at least three publicly-traded portfolio companies. Rashid further acted as a principalpoint of contact between these portfolio coinpaliies' executives and the Relevant Funds.28. Rashid received compensation for providing investment advice to the RelevantFunds. He also received director fees for serving on the portfolio companies' boards ofdirectors. In total, Rashid received millions of dollars per year related to his advisory services8Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 8 of 28 with Apollo during the Relevant Period. Rashid hid an interest as a limited partner in the;eneral partlzers of Fund V, Fund VI, Fund VII, and ANRP, as we11 as equity interests in theRelevant Funds.29. As investTnent advisers, Rashid and Apollo had a fundamental obligation to act inthe best interests of their clients, to provide investment advice that was in their clients' bestinterests, and to exercise the utmost good faith in dealing with their clients.II. The Relevant Funds' Governing Documents and Apollo's Policies Prohibited RashidFrom Charging Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds30. The Relevant Funds' govenling documents permitted Apollo and Rashid tocharge expenses to the Relevant Funds only if the expenses related to the funds' investments andoperations. The govel-~1in~ documents dicl not permit Rashid or Apollo to charge personalexpenses to the Relevant Funds.31. Apollo's limited partnership agreement for ANRP, for example, stated that ANRPwas responsible only for operating expenses ""arising in connection with [ANRP's] operationsaild the acquisition, ownership, and maintenance of investments in the Portfolio Companies.""ANRP's limited partnership agreement did not permit Apollo to charge its employees' personalexpenses to the fund.32. Similarly, during the Relevant Period, Apollo's Travel and ExpenseReimbursement Policies and Procedures (""T&E Policies"") permitted its employees to chargetheir clients only with reasonable business and travel expenses incun-ed in the performance oftheir duties. It stated, ""Apollo will reimburse employees for business and travel expensesincurred while performing their duties, provided the expenses are necessary, reasonable andappropriately documented."" It further required employees to ""use best efforts to appropriately9Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 9 of 28 allocate the expensc,~' including using project codes to identify amounts that should be billed toApollo's funds' portfolio companies, investment funds, or other special projects.33. Apollo's T&E Policies fiirther stated that ""[e]thics, integrity, and efficiency arethe cornerstones of success for all professional service companies,"" and that ""[e]very employeewho incurs expenses on behalf of the Company has a fiduciary obligation Š to know, understandand adhere to the Company's Travel &Expense Reimbursement Policies and Procedures."" Itwarned that ""[a]ny attempt to knowingly submit a false claim will be treated as a seriousdisciplinary offense.""34. Apollo's T&E Policies further gave examples of ""Typical Non-ReimbursableT&E Items"" that included ""Barber/Beauty Shop or Spa charges,"" ""Clothing,"" ""Non-Business(e.g. personal) travel and entertainment expenses,"" ""Personal items,"" and ""spousal or othercompanion expenses."" Notwithstanding Apollo's T&E Policies, Rashid charged each of thesespecified, non-reimbursable items to the Relevant Funds.35. In addition, Apollo's Employee Handbook stated that employees maybereimbursed for ""reasonable business expenses at the discretion of the Company,"" and that""[e]x~ensing items that are not business related is a serious offense.""36. During the Relevant Period, Rashid signed annual certifications that he hadcompleted Apollo's compliance training that included training concerning Apollo's T&EPolicies. Rashid also signed Apollo's Code of Ethics, which stated, among other things, that""[t]he falsification of any book, record or account relating to the business of Apollo, its clients orto the disposition of assets of the Firm or its clients (including, without limitltion, t11e submissionof any false personal expense statement, claim for reimbursement of anon-business expense or afalse record or claim uiadcr an employee benefit plan) is prohibited.""10Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 10 of 28 37. Rashid knew, or was reckless in not lalowing, that the Relevant Funds' offeringdocuments, other governing documents, and Apollo's T&E Policies prohibited him fromcharging his personal expenses to the Relevant Funds. Rashid received documents regarding~~ polio's T&E Policies, attended mandatory training regarding such policies and procedures, andconfirmed ghat he understood such policies and procedures as an adviser with Apollo.III. Apollo's Business Expense Reimbursement Process38. Pursuant to Apollo's T&E Policies, Apollo gave employees such as Rashid acorporate credit card to pay for business-related expenses. Apollo's T&E Policies emphasizedthat ""Employees generally should NOT use their [corporate credit card] for personalexpenses.'' It further directed that ""[i]f for some reason you do need to charge a personalexpense on the [corporate credit card] ... ,you are required to remit payment directly"" to thecredit card company.39. To obtain reimbursement for claimed business expenses, Apollo's T&E Policiesrequired employees to submit expense reports each month to address the ""WHO, WHAT,WHEN WHERE and WHY"" of each business expense.40. Apollo's T&E Policies permitted employees to delegate expense reportpreparation to other individuals, such as an assistant, but noted that ""the employee is ultimatelyresponsible for timely and accurate submission of his/her expenses regardless of who preparesthe expense report."" In addition, for at least part of the Relevant Period, before submitting'- ~~~ expensereports; Apollo's T&~ policies required employees to certify that they (1) ""have read,understood and complied with [Apollo's T&E Policies]""; and (2) ""affrm that the reimbursableexpenses included in this expense report are valid business expenses.''11Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 11 of 28 4~1. Pursuant to t~lese policies, Apo110 gave Rashid a corporate credit card to pay forhis business expenses. The corporate credit card com~aany sent Apollo monthly bills containingRashid's charges. Apollo paid Rashid's bill directly, and then sent Rashid draft expense reports~~~>r Rashid to identify who should ultimately be responsible for each of Rashid's expenses and toprovide justifications for all business expenses.42. Apollo required Rashid to personally approve each monthly expense report beforesubmitting it to Apollo's expense manager for review and approval.43. Although Rashid's administrative assistants prepared the initial drafts of hisexpense reports, Rashid approved them and provided supporting details and instructionsconcerning how Apollo should bill the expenses. Rashid often provided verbal explanations tohis assistants when they had questions about particular expenses. He also highlighted andannotated draft expense reports to identify the business purpose and the client or entity thatshould pay for each expense, which his administrative assistants then finalized and submitted toApollo for final disposition in accordance wit1~1 Rashid's instructions.44. At least in 2010, Rashid also submitted affidavits ""to prove the legitimatebusiness purpose"" for claimed business expenses when he did not provide receipts. Even afterApollo no longer required employees to submit these affidavits, Rashid continued to review andapprove his expense reports before IZis assistants submitted them to Apo11o.45. AfterŁ Rashid or his administrative assistants submitted a final expense report to-' Apollo, 'Apollo would a1~~ocate Rashid's expenses to'the individual funds for which each expensetivas related as Rashid had indicated in his expense reports.12Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 12 of 28 46. Rashid knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Relevant Funds would becharged for any expense that he allocated to a Relevant Fund or one of its portfolio companies asa claimed business expense in his monthly expense reports.47. Apollo sent the Relevant Funds periodic (often quarterly) statements setting forth1Łeimbursement for Rashid's (arid other Apollo employees') claimed business expenses. TheRelevant Funds then reimbursed Apollo for Rashid's claimed business expenses via wiretra~lsfers.IV. During the Relevant Period, Rashid Fraudulently Charged Nearly $290,000 of HisPersonal Expenses to the Relevant Funds48. By no later than ?010, Rashid began fraudulently charging personal expenses tothe Relevant Funds in breach of the Relevant Funds' governing documents, Apollo's T&EPolicies, and his and Apollo's fiduciary duties to the Relevant Funds.49. Throughout the Relevant Pez7od, Rashid regularly charged personal expei~7ses tohis corporate credit card and then fraudulently claimed them. as business expenses on his monthlyexpense reports to Apollo. In most cases, Apollo then obtained reimbursement from theRelevant Funds for these expenses based ot~ Rashid's false representations that they werebusiness related.50. During the Relevant Period, Rashid misappropriated approximately X290,000 (ofwhich at least approximately $170,000 post-dated June 13, 20'11) from the Relevant ~'uizds byfalsely claiming that his personal expenses were legitimate business expenses. These expensescomprised hundreds of different charges including charges for personal travel, consumerelectronics and restaurant meals.A. In 2010, Rashid Admitted to Fraudulently Billing Certain Personal Expenses '~13Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 13 of 28 51. During 20'10, Rashid TŁegularly charged expenses related to personal groomingservices that he received at a high-end hair salon to his Apollo corporate credit card. Incompleting his expense reports, Rashid falsely claimed that this hair salon was a restaurant andthat more than X1,100 of expenses were business-related ""meals with management,"" sometimesidentifying specific executives he claimed to have taken to dinner. Based on Rashid's falserepresentations, certain of the Relevant Funds paid for personal hairŁ salon charges that Rashidclaimed were business expenses.52. In or around September 2010, Rashid's administrative assistant becamesuspicious of Rashid's explanations for these recurring expenses. After detez7nining that therewas no restaurant in New York with the name of the vendor on the credit card statement, but thata New York hair salon had that name, she reported her concerns to Apollo's expense manager.The expense manager escalated the matter to Apo11o's Chief Financial Officer (`'CFO""), whodecided to conduct a review of Rashid's expense reports for the previous six months. Uponreview of those expense reports, the expense manager identified a number of other suspiciousentries, such as approximately $5,000 in New York City apartment realtor expenses that Rashidcharged to a Relevant Fund, claiming that they were for ""zŁesearch reports"" relating to the f'und'sinvestments when, in fact, they were Rashid's personal expenses.53. In November 2010, Apollo's CFO confronted Rashid about these questionableexpenses. Rashid admitted that they were his personal expenses, and ultimately agreed to payback almost $8,000 in fraudulently billed personal expenses. Apollo's CFO told Rashid thatbilling personal expenses to the private equity funds was not acceptable and instructed hiin not torepeat the conduct.14Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 14 of 28 54. Despite this incident, Rashid failed to acknowledge to Apollo or any of theRelevant Funds that he had previously billed additional personal expenses to the Relevant Funds.55. For example, Rashid failed to disclose to Apollo or any of the Relevant Funds a~'''~S personal charge at high-end clothing store Ermene~ildo Zegna (""Zegna"") from June 2010,which Rashid charged to a Relevant Fund on his expense report by claiming that it was a ""clientlift.`56. When Apollo management asked Rashid about this charge in September 2U 10,Rashid falsely claimed that it was `'shirts and ties"" for fifteen specific portfolio companyexecutives to celebrate the company's IPO. The named executives, however, did not receiveclothing or any other gifts from Rashid. Rashid had falsely made this claim to obtainreimbursement from a Relevant Fund for his own personal charges.57. Rashid also failed to disclose to Apollo ar any of the Relevant Funds inNovember 2010 that he had charged the following personal expenses to the Relevant Funds asbusiness expenses: over $2,300 in charges at the Apple Store in May 2010 for purported ""IPOgifts,"" an additional $1,265 in charges at Zegna in July 2010 for purported ""office gifts,"" and a$275 charge at Bliss Spa for ""a missed appointment due to [portfolio company] conference callt11at rail over Š no last minute cancellations."" None of these expenses were client bifts, and the$275 charge at Bliss was, in fact, for approximately $75 in services for his sister and anapproximately $200 gift card used for Rashid's personal purposes."" ` ~ B. ""~Rashid~Continued to Charge Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds AfterNovember 201058. Nor did the November 2010 incident deter Rashid from continuing to chargepersonal expenses to the Relevant Funds. Only a month later in December 2010, Rashid emailedan Apo110 coznplialice offacer to request pi-e-approval to give purported 1loladay gifts from Zegna15Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 15 of 28 and the Apple Store to executives of at least two of the Relevant Funds' portfolio companies. Tojustify his request, Rashid provided a list of twenty-six portfolio company executives for whomhe intended to purchase gifts. Based on Rashid's misrepresentations, the Apollo complianceofficer approved Rashid's request.59. A few weeks later, Rashid charged more than $3,800 at Zegna and $800 at theApple Store. He allocated these expenses in his ex~~ense report to certain. of the Relevant Fundsin accordance with the purported business justifications in his email to the Apollo complianceofficer.60. Rashid never gave any gifts to the executives that he identified. Instead, hebought items at these stores for himself and his family members.C. Rashid Fraudulently Charged His Vacation Expenses to the Relevant Funds61. Rashid also billed the Relevant Funds for tens of thousands of dollars in expensesfor family vacations.62. For example, Rashid billed two of the Relevant Funds for about $7,500 in airfareand hotel charges for a vacation Rashid and his wife took to attend a friend's wedding in Hawaiiin 2010. Rashid allocated the couple's five-night stay at the ocean-front Ritz Carlton and rentalcar fees to a portfolio company owned by Fund V, and he separately allocated both his and hiswife's airfare to Hawaii to a portfolio company owned by Fund TIL In his expense reports,Rashid justified charging these Relevant Funds for this personal trip by claiming on his expense~~report~that~it~vasfor`a~""busin~esstrip toDai~as for [portfoliocoinpany] meetings"" and a ""[l~]otelfor [portfolio company] conference.""16Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 16 of 28 63. The justifications Rashid provided were false. This trip was personal and had noconnection to the Relevant Funds' or their portfolio companies. Nor was it to Dallas. Rashidknew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these were false business justifications.64. In addition, Ras~lid charged expenses relating to the following vacations to certainof the Relevant Funds: (1) approximately $7,500 for trips to Cancun, Mexico, with his wife overthe New Year's holidays in 2010 and 2011; (2) over $4,500 for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,with his wife over the New Year's holiday in 2012; (3) approximately $1,400 for trips to bed-and-breakfast hotels nearŁ the New Jersey shore in 2009, 2010, and 2011; (4) approximately$5,000 for a trip to the St. Regis Bal Harbour resort in Florida with his parents and sister over theThanksgiving holiday in 201?; and (5) approximately $4,000 for weekend trips to Las Vegas,Nevada in 2012 and 2U 13.65. All of these trips were personal holiday trips and vacations that were notappropriate client charges, yet, ir1 each instance, Rashid submitted expense reports fraudulentlyclaiming them as business expenses, azld Apollo obtained reimbursement for these expensesfrom the Relevant Funds.D. In 2012, Rashid Made Misrepresentations and Falsified a Receipt to JustifyBilling Additional Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds, and AgainAdmitted to Charging Certain Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds66. In January ?012, Rashid again sought and obtained approval from Apollo'scompliance department to purchase ""holiday gifts"" at Zegna and Bliss Spa for a list of portfolio~co~npanyexecntives: ' I~ this request; Rashid represented that he would ""stay at the limit of $100per person"" and specified t11at he would be purchasing ""Zegna ties for the inen and Bliss giftcards for the Women."" Rashid's pre-approved request specified thirty-eight portfolio companyexecutives to whom lie intended to give holiday gifts.17Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 17 of 28 b7. Following his request, in ~'ebru~ry 2012, Rashid charged X400 at Bliss to hisApollo credit card and allocated the charge to certain of the Relevant Funds as ""Holiday Gifts.""On April 27, 2012, Rashid charged X3,500 at Zegn~ to his Apollo credit card.6b. On the same day that Rashid made the $3,500 charge at Zegna, he forwarded toleis assistant the compliance department's email approving the purchase of thirty-eight corporategifts of ""Zegna ties for the men and Bliss gift cards for the Women."" Thereafter, in May 201?,when Rashid's assistant received the initial draft of Rashid's monthly Apollo credit card charges,she noticed the $3,500 charge at Zegna and asked him if it was personal. Rashid responded thatit was a business expense and should be allocated to certain of the Relevant Funds as holidaygifts. Because Rashid was travelling at the time, his assistant called Zegna to request a receiptin keeping with Apollo's T&E policies.b9. The Zegna store clerk emailed Rashid's assistant a receipt for the ;3,500 chargeon his Apollo credit. card. The receipt showed the charge was for a suit for Rashid's father, riotfor a business expense oi- business gifts as Rashid had claimed.70. Shortly after Rashid's assistant received the Zegna receipt, she received atelephone call from Rashid asking why she called Zegna for a receipt.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid falsely claimed that certain individuals accompanied him to dinners to make it appear various personal expenses had a business purpose, and he doctored a receipt in an effort to justify his purchase of a $3,500 suit for his father as a business expense.  According to the SEC's complaint, despite being caught by the firm and told to stop on two occasions in 2010 and 2012, Rashid continued to expense personal items to clients into 2013.  After he was confronted about his expenses for a third time, Rashid admitted that he charged approximately $220,000 in personal expenses.

100,"1IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI NORTHERN DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, Civil Action File No. v.MALACHI FINANCIAL PRODUCTS, INC. and  PORTER B. BINGHAM, Jury Trial Requested Defendants. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF The plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint and alleges the following: SUMMARY 1.This action concerns misconduct by a m unicipal advisor and its principal in connection with a $1.1 million bond offering by th e City of Rolling Fork, Mississippi (ﬁRolling Forkﬂ or theﬁCityﬂ). 2.In January 2015, the City hired Defendan t Malachi Financial Products, Inc. (ﬁMalachiﬂ) to serve as its municipal adviso r for a contemplated bond offering. Malachiis owned and controlled by Defendant Porter B. Bingham(ﬁBinghamﬂ). 3.In May 2015, Bingham accepted two payments totaling $2,500 from AnthonyA. Stovall (ﬁStovallﬂ), a registered representative who was associated with a broker-dealer and  municipal securities dealer Bonwick Capital Partners, LLC(ﬁBonwickﬂ). 3:18-cv-1-HSO-LRACase 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 1 of 15 24.Approximately two weeks after receiving those payments,a Malachi employee recommended that the City hire Bonwick to under write the anticipated bond offering. In June 2015, the City hired Bonwick to underwrite the of fering. Neither Bingha m nor Stovall disclosed the payments or the resulting conflicts of interest to theCity. 5.After the bond offering closed in October 2015, Bingham directed a Malachi employee to submit two invoices for municipal advisory services to the bond trustee for payment. 6.The first invoice, for $22,000, was consiste nt with the written agreementbetween Malachi and the City, which provided that the Ci ty would pay no more than 2% of the total offeringamount. 7.The second invoice, for $33,000, purported to be for additional services thatwere not part of the original agreement. In fact, the second invoice was fraudulent because Malachi did not provide the purported additional services and the City did not authorize or agree to the additionalcharges. 8.Although both invoices were addressed to the Mayor of the City, Malachi did not provide them to the Mayor or anyone else at th e City before payment. Thus, the City was not aware of the fraudulent overcharge until after the bond trustee paid theinvoice. VIOLATIONS 9.As a result of this conduct, Malachi and Bingham violated Sections 15B(a)(5) and 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77o-4(a)(5) and 78o-4(c)(1)] and Municipal Secur ities Rulemaking Board (ﬁMSRBﬂ) Rule G-17 thereunder, and Bingham aided and abetted Malachi™s violations of thes e provisions.

DEFENDANTS 14.Malachi Financial Products, Inc. (ﬁMalachiﬂ) is a Georgia corporationformed in 2005 and located in Roswell, Georgia. Malach i has one employee in addition to Bingham. In 2014, Malachi registered with the Commission and the MSRB as a municipal advisor. However, neither Bingham nor Malachi™s other employeeto ok the required Series 50 Municipal Advisor Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 3 of 15 4exam within the requisite time. As a result, Malachi is not currently permitted to provide municipal advice.15.Porter B. Bingham , age 56, of Roswell, Georgia has been president andsole shareholder of Malachi since its formation. Prio r to forming Malachi, Bingham was a registered representative with several different broker-dealers. Bingham held Series 7, 24 and 63securities  licenses. The last firm that Bingham was regi stered with was The Malachi Group, Inc., (ﬁThe Malachi Groupﬂ) a registered broker-dealer he owned and contro lled. The Malachi Group, which ceased operations more than a decade ago, predated Malachi, and is a completely separate  entity. In August 2007, the Financial Industry Re gulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ), via a consent agreement, suspended Bingham as a general securities principal for a period of one year and fined him $10,000 for various net capital violations by The Malachi Group and for failing to file The Malachi Group™s annual audit report in a time ly manner. In turn, The Malachi Group was sanctioned on eight occasions for a variety of compliance issues and for failing to maintain the  proper net capital amount. In 2006, The Malach i Group was expelled from the then National Association of Securities Dealer s (ﬁNASDﬂ), which is now known as FINRA, for failing to pay fines and its broker-dealer registration wascancelled. 16.Previously, Malachi had filed Form MA -I with the Commission establishing Bingham as a person associated with a municipal advisory firm. However, because Binghamdid not take or pass the Series 50 municipal advisor exam by the requisite deadline, pursuant to MSRB Rule G-3, he is not permitted to act as an associated person of a municipal advisor or  provide municipaladvice. Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 4 of 15 5RELATED ENTITY AND INDIVIDUAL 17.City of Rolling Fork, Mississippi (ﬁRolling Forkﬂ or the ﬁCityﬂ) is thecounty seat of Sharkey County. Rolling Fork has a popul ation of approximately 2,025 and is located approximately 90 minutes Northwest of Jackson, Mississippi. 18.Anthony Stovall, age 50, of West Orange, New Jersey, is currently notemployed in the financial services industry.

Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 5 of 15 6FACTS A.The City of Rolling Fork Hired Malachi to Provide Municipal Advisory Services for its BondOffering 22.In late 2014, Rolling Fork, a small munici pality with a population of just over 2,000, sought to raise funds for certain improveme nt projects. These projects included paving streets and public parking areas, repairing muni cipal buildings, and constructing a municipal swimmingpool. 23.In January 2015, Rolling Fork hired Malachi as the municipal advisor fora proposed bond offering to fund the nece ssary improvements (theﬁOfferingﬂ). 24.The City and Malachi entered into an ﬁAgreement for Professional Financial Advisory Servicesﬂ (ﬁMA Agreementﬂ). Bingham, as Malachi™s president and soleprincipal,  signed the MA Agreement on behalf of Malach i. Under the terms of the MA Agreement, Malachi was to be paid an amount not to exceed 2% of the debtissuance. B.Bingham and Malachi Recommended that the CityHire Stovall and Bonwick Without Disclosing Stovall™s Recent Payments toBingham 25.Bingham and Stovall have known each other since 2004. Between 2005 and 2013, Stovall and Bingham had worked together pr oviding underwriting and municipal advisory services, respectively, to municipal is suers in approximately 15 bondofferings. 26.In late May 2015, Stovall provided Bi ngham with a total of $2,500 intwo separatepayments. 27.Specifically, on or about May 22, 2015, Stova ll directed a family member to write a check for $2,000 from an account on which Stovall was not a signatory.  That check was  made payable to ﬁcash MFP, LLC.ﬂ  MFP, LLC, which Bingham controlled, is a defunct  corporation Bingham formed in 2010.  Bingham deposited the check in an MFP , LLC account on  May 26, 2-15. Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 6 of 15 728.A few days later, on May 28, Stovall dir ected the family member to wire an additional $500 from the same account to a different MFP, LLC bank account. 29.In each case, the checks were deposited just in time to allow Bingham to avoid a negative balance in eachaccount. 30.Bingham used the funds for personal and business purposes. 31.A few weeks after these payments were received, at a June 2015 meeting of the Rolling Fork Board of Aldermen, aMalachi employee, at Bingham™s instruction,recommended  that Rolling Fork hire Stovall and Bonwick to underwrite theOffering. 32.Stovall than made a presentation at the m eeting in which he describedBonwick™s capabilities and pastperformance. 33.The Malachi representative did not recommend or introduce anyother underwriting firms for the City toconsider. 34.Based in part on Malachi™s recommendation, Rolling Fork™s Board ofAlderman voted to hire Stovall andBonwick. 35.Neither the Malachi representative nor Stovall disclosed to the City that Stovall had paid Bingham $2,500 only a few weeksearlier. C.Malachi and Bingham Overcharged the City for Municipal Advisory Services 36.The City™s Offering was originally contemplated to be for $2million. 37.Due to the City™s statutory offering limits, however, Rolling Fork was requiredto reduce the size of the Offering to $1.1million. 38.This meant that, under the terms of the MA Agreement, Malachi™s compensation (2% of the total offering amount) was reduced from $40,000 to$22,000. Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 7 of 15 839.Malachi and Bingham attempted to rec oup this lost revenue by fraudulently charging the City for purported ﬁadditional services ﬂ in connection with the Offering that they did not actuallyprovide. 40.On October 15, 2015, the day after the Offering closed, Bingham directed Malachi™s employee to prepare and send tw o invoices totaling $55,000 to the bond trusteefor payment. 41.One invoice was for $22,000, which was Ma lachi™s contractual fee forthe municipal advisory services provided to Rolling Fork (2% of the $1.1 millionissuance). 42.The other invoice was for $33,000 and, accord ing to the invoice, was purportedly for services related to the ﬁinvestment of bondproceeds.ﬂ 43.This invoice was false and fraudulent and wa s not authorized or agreed to bythe City. 44.Although both invoices were addressed to the Mayor of Rolling Fork, Malachi only transmitted them to the bond trustee and never sent them to the Mayor or the City. As a result, the bond trustee paid the full $55,000 to Malachi before Rolling Fork became aware of the  invoices.45.Malachi provided no services relating to the investment of bond proceeds to the City of Rolling Fork. Additionally, the bond proceed s had not, in fact, been invested by thetime of the secondinvoice. 46.Neither Bingham nor Malachi has any doc umentation reflecting any investment services they purportedly provided the City in connection with the proceeds from theOffering. Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 8 of 15 947.Although Malachi and Bingham may have also created some post-bondissuance compliance policies for the City and examined the City tax rolls to determine the City™s legal  lending limit, neither of those services, ev en if provided, justified the $33,000invoice. 48.The post-issuance compliance policies that Malachi and Bingham purportedly created for the City contained nothing but standa rd boilerplate language , much of which canbe found merely by doing an internet search. As su ch, it would have been unreasonable to billthe City $33,000 for preparing these policies. More importantly, Malach i and Bingham never provided those written policies to theCity. 49.Although Malachi and Bingham did a minimal amount of work to examine Rolling Fork™s property tax rolls to calculate the City™s legal debt limit, those services were already contemplated by th e MA Agreement and thus do not support the additionalinvoice. 50.The MA Agreement provided that Malachi would ﬁhelp . . . determine an issue amount,ﬂ assist with ﬁstructuring the issue,ﬂ a nd ﬁadvis[e] on other matters related to theCity™s debt and capital plans.ﬂ Calculation of the City™s debt limit was clearly necessary to determine  the issue amount and is a typical task that a municipal advisor would undertake as part of a general obligationoffering. 51.Moreover, the minimal amount of work pe rformed on thistask would not justifya $33,000 invoice, as Malachi spent only between three and five hours working on the tax valuation issue.Case 3:18-cv-00001-HSO-LRA   Document 1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 9 of 15 10COUNT IŠFRAUDULENT PRACTICES BY A MUNICIPAL ADVISOR Violations by Malachi and Bingham of Section 15B(a)(5) of the Exchange Act[15 U.S.C. § 77o-4(a)(5)] 52.Paragraphs1through51areherebyre-allegedandareincorporatedhereinby reference.53.Section 15B(a)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 77o-4(a)(5)] provides in relevant part that no municipal advisor sha ll make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to provide advice to a municipal entity with respect to the  issuance of municipal securities in connection with which such municipal advisor engages in any fraudulent, deceptive, or ma nipulative act orpractice. 54.By engaging in the conduct alleged a bove, Defendants Malachi and Bingham acted as municipal advisors, as th at term is defined in Section 15B(e)(4)(A) of the ExchangeAct, [15 U.S.C. §78o-4(e)(4)(A)]. 55.By engaging in the conduct alleged above, Defendants Malachi and Bingham violated Section 15B(a)(5) of the Exchange Ac t [15 U.S.C. § 78oŒ4(a)(5)] by using the meansor instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the mails while engaging in fraudulent, deceptive, and/or manipulative acts or practices in providing advice to a municipalentity.

In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, the SEC alleges that Malachi Financial Products, Inc. (""Malachi""), a Georgia corporation, and its principal, Porter B. Bingham of Roswell, Georgia, fraudulently overcharged Rolling Fork for municipal advisory services related to an October 2015 municipal bond offering. Malachi is registered as a municipal advisor with both the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (""MSRB""). According to the complaint, after the offering closed, Malachi and Bingham submitted two invoices to the bond trustee for payment. The SEC alleges that one of those invoices was fraudulent, because it was for services that Malachi and Bingham did not perform and the city did not authorize. The complaint also alleges that Bingham failed to disclose to the city that he had accepted payments totaling $2,500 from Anthony Stovall, an employee of a municipal underwriter, shortly before he and Malachi recommended that the city hire Stovall's firm to underwrite the bond offering. The complaint alleges that the city ultimately hired that underwriting firm based on Bingham and Malachi's recommendation. Finally, the complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingham violated their fiduciary duty to the city.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingham violated Sections 15B(a)(5) and 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint further alleges that both defendants violated MSRB Rule G-17, which requires municipal advisors to deal fairly with their clients. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and other relief against both defendants.  In separate administrative proceedings, the Commission entered a settled Administrative Order against Stovall.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Justin Delfino and supervised by Peter J. Diskin, both of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Edward Sullivan and Mr. Delfino and supervised by M. Graham Loomis of the Atlanta Regional Office. An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Nadine Sophia Evans of the National Exam Program and Kee Han of the Atlanta Regional Office."

AMRIT J. S. CHAHAL, Defendant.      COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commi ssion (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges as follows: SUMMARY  1. This matter involves a fraudulent investment scheme orchestrated by Amrit J. S. Chahal (ﬁChahalﬂ) through his unregistered, Fairfax, Virginia-based company, Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC (ﬁKane Capitalﬂ). 2. From at least February 2015 through Febr uary 2018, Chahal fraudulently solicited approximately $1.4 million from about 50 individuals by falsely claiming to be an experienced  and successful trader who could generate above -market returns for clients through a low-risk trading strategy.  In reality, Chahal had substantially no experience working in the financial or securities industry or trading securities on behalf of clients. 3. Chahal initially invested client funds in a variety of investments, and suffered significant trading losses.  Instead of disclosing the losses to his clients, however, Chahal lied about their investment returns.  Chahal creat ed and sent clients fa lse and fictitious account Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 1 of 11 PageID# 1 2  statements exhibiting inflated re turns, which prompted some clients to invest even more money in his fraudulent investment scheme. 4.

Among other things, certain of the acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations of the federal securities laws alleged herein  occurred within the Easter n District of Virginia.  DEFENDANT 9. Amrit J. S. Chahal, age 30, resides in Fairfax, Virginia.  Chahal is the President, Chief Executive Officer, and sole employee of Ka ne Capital.  Chahal has never held any securities licenses, nor has he ever been associat ed with a registered broker-dealer or investment adviser other than Kane Capital.   RELATED ENTITY 10. Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC is a Virginia limited liability company formed by Chahal in December 2014 located in Fa irfax, Virginia.  Kane Capital has never been registered with the Commission or any state secu rities regulatory authority in any capacity.   FACTS The Fraudulent Investment Scheme  11. In December 2014, Chahal formed Kane Cap ital with substantially no experience working in the financial or securities industry or trading securities on behalf of clients.   12. By February 2015, Chahal began asking friends and family members to give him money to trade in, among other thin gs, securities on their behalf.   13. In exchange for his investment advisory services, Chahal said that he would charge two fees:  (1) an annual fee of 2.5%; and (2) a performance- based fee equal to 10% of an investor™s returns that exceeded an annual return of 30 percent. Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 3 of 11 PageID# 3 4  14. Chahal™s clients provided him with money for the purpose of purchasing and selling options, futures, and commodities, th ereby putting such investments at risk. 15. Chahal pooled client funds in multiple br okerage accounts, and used such funds to trade in options, futures, and commodities as well as, as described below, to fund his personal lifestyle and to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors.  Chahal™s profits also were derived from his clients™ investment returns. 16. Clients of Kane Capital expected profits through Chahal™s investment efforts on their behalf.   17. In seeking investments, Chahal told pros pective clients that Kane Capital would open brokerage accounts in their name, and tr ade in a mix of options, futures, and/or commodities as part of a low-risk, high-freque ncy trading strategy.  Chahal, however, rarely opened separate brokerage accounts on behalf of each of his clients as promised.  Instead, he commingled client funds in multiple brokerage acc ounts held in his own name or in the name of Kane Capital. 18. Chahal also directed prospective clie nts to Kane Capital™s website, which included multiple statements about Kane Capital™ s investment strategy.  Through Kane Capital™s website, Chahal falsely claimed, among other things, that the comp any ﬁuses the latest software to achieve the highest possible profit from each investment, often times within nano seconds,ﬂ and ﬁspecializes in selecting low-risk/high-yield investment opportunities.ﬂ 19. In reality, Chahal personally traded risky options on margin and purchased and sold futures and commodities, as opposed to purchasing and selling low-risk/high-yield investments with the aid of hi gh-frequency trading software. Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 4 of 11 PageID# 4 5  20. Chahal also guaranteed prospective invest ors the return of th eir principle, and claimed that ﬁeach of [Kane Capital™s] investment s are carefully reviewed by industry experts.ﬂ No industry experts ever approved Kane Capital™s investments. 21. Based upon these misrepresentations and t hose described below, friends, family members, and others gave Chahal their money to invest in the fraudulent scheme.  Chahal and Kane Capital ultimately lost a significant portion of their clients™ investment funds. Chahal Misrepresented Kane Capital™s Investment Returns 22. Chahal touted both his personal trading successes and Kane Capital™s historical trading performance to Kane Capital clients and prospective clients.   23. Chahal represented to one of his investors that Kane Capital averaged ﬁbetween like 28 percent to 30, 34 percent return per year.ﬂ  Chahal further stated that Kane Capital managed over $5 million of investor funds.  Both of these statements were false. 24. By the end of 2015, Chahal had raised at least $430,000 from investors.  Of that amount, Chahal transferred approximately $207,000 into a brokerage account in the name of Kane Capital, traded those investment funds, and suffered trading losses of approximately $178,000, or 86% of his clients™ investments.  Rather than cea sing his investment scheme, Chahal continued to raise about $1 million more in investments. 25. In order to do so, instead of disclosing these losses, Chahal repeatedly misrepresented Kane Capital™s re turns to solicit new funds from prospective clients and to lull current clients, many of whom invested additional funds. 26. Through Kane Capital™s website, Chahal granted clients access to a secure portal through which they could obtain information about their accounts.  Chahal falsified the account balances and quarterly statements that client s were able to access through the portal.   Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 5 of 11 PageID# 5 6  27. In one of the few instances in which he opened a brokerage account in the name of a client, for example, Chahal fabricated the brokerage statement for that account to reflect a balance of $206,043.63 when, in reality, the account held only $1,043.63. 28. To deceive some of his other clients, Chahal created a fraudulent brokerage statement for a nonexistent account showing a balance of $71,077.63. Chahal Misappropriated Client Funds and Made Ponzi-like Payments to Other Investors 29. Chahal also used a significant portion of new client funds for his personal benefit, and to pay earlier investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme. 30. Chahal used client funds to pay for, among other things, his luxury car, rent, travel, dining, and other living expenses. 31. In the days following a deposit of invest or funds into Kane Capital™s checking account, Chahal routinely made paym ents to earlier investors.   32. For example, on November 15, 2016, Chahal deposited $35,000 of client investments into Kane Capital™s primary bank a ccount, which, at the time, held approximately $1,700.  Over the next few days, Chahal issued checks totaling $20,000 to two investors referencing ﬁpartial withdrawﬂ and ﬁaccount closure.ﬂ   CHAHAL VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 33. During the relevant period, Chahal owned, operated, and controlled Kane Capital. 34. Chahal made purchases, offers, and sales of securities on behalf of clients of Kane Capital. 35. Chahal exercised control over what purchas es and sales were made with client funds, and acted as an investment adviser. Case 1:18-cv-00426-LMB-IDD   Document 1   Filed 04/12/18   Page 6 of 11 PageID# 6 7  36. In connection with his purchases, offers, and sales, Chahal made use of the means and instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails, including the use of the internet and interstate phone calls. 37. All of the misrepresentations and omissions set forth herein, i ndividually and in the aggregate, are material, and were made in conn ection with and in the purchase, offer, or sale of securities.  There is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the misrepresented facts and omitted informationŠi ncluding, among other items, misrepresentations and omissions concerning Chahal ™s trading experience, clients™ investment returns, and the misappropriation of and Ponzi-like payments with investor fundsŠimportant in deciding whether or not to invest with Chahal and Kane Ca pital, and that the accurate facts would alter the ﬁtotal mixﬂ of information available. 38. In connection with the conduct described herein, Chahal acted knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.  Among other things, Chahal knew, was reckless, or should have known that he was making material misrepresent ations and omitting to state material facts necessary to make certain stat ements not misleading under the ci rcumstances in connection with and in the purchase, offer, or sale of securities. 39. Through his material misrepresentations and omissions, Chahal obtained money or property. 40. Through this scheme, Chahal engaged in acts, transactions or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon offerees, purchasers and prospective purchasers of securities.

S. Chahal, of Fairfax, Va., used his company, Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC, to fraudulently solicit approximately $1.4 million from about 50 individuals, including friends and family members. According to the complaint, Chahal lured investors by falsely claiming to be an experienced and successful trader who could generate above-market returns for clients through a low-risk trading strategy. The SEC alleges that, in reality, Chahal had substantially no experience working in the financial or securities industry or trading securities on behalf of clients. The complaint further alleges Chahal initially invested client funds in a variety of investments, but suffered significant trading losses. According to the complaint, instead of disclosing the losses, Chahal lied to his clients about their investment returns, continued raising funds, then used the money for his personal benefit, including to pay for his luxury car, rent, travel, dining, and other living expenses, and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia also announced criminal charges against Chahal. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission also charged Chahal.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on April 12, 2018, charges Chahal with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and penalties.  The SEC's continuing investigation was conducted by Christine R. O'Neil and Brendan P. McGlynn in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC's litigation will be led by Christopher R. Kelly and Sarah Hall and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and the Virginia State Corporation Commission."
25,"- 1 - UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION   UNITED STATES SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,  Case No.  Plaintiff,  v.     HON.    ERNEST J. ROMER, III,    Defendant.  ____________________________________/ COMPLAINT Plaintiff, the United States Securities a nd Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges as follows: SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 1. The SEC brings this civil law enfo rcement action to address Defendant Ernest J. Romer, III™s (ﬁRomerﬂ) multi-million- dollar securities fraud.  From approximately 2014 through 2016, Romer defrauded at least 30 of his retail brokerage customers out of approximately $2.7 million.  During that time period, Romer worked as a registered representative associated with CoreCap Investments, Inc., a registered broker-dealer with the SEC (ﬁCoreCap Investmentsﬂ). 2. Romer persuaded at least 30 of his cu stomers to sell securities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer th e proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC (ﬁP&R Capitalﬂ) or CoreCap Solutions, LLC (ﬁCoreCap Solutionsﬂ).  Romer represented to customers that upon transferring money to P& R Capital and CoreCap Solutions, he would invest their money in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.1    Page 1 of 10  - 2 - investments.  Based on Romer™s representati ons, the customers understood that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with CoreCap Investments. 3. Romer™s statements to his customers were false.  P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no relationship to CoreCap  Investments.  Romer did not invest the cust omers™ money in the stock market for their benefit.  He instead stole the money for his own personal use.  Romer commingled approximately $2.7 million of customer funds w ith his advances from CoreCap Investments and other sources for a total of approximately $4.4 million.  Of that, Romer used  approximately $3.5 million for trading in his personal brokerage accounts, paid approximately $714,000 to cover his personal expenses, paid approximately $343,000 to customers of his prior brokerage firms, paid approximately $302,000 to customers of CoreCap Investments, and transferred appr oximately $41,000 to family members. 4. By engaging in this conduct, Romer violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.   5. In connection with this lawsuit, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Romer to enjoin him from future viol ations of the above-cited provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC furthe r seeks an order requiring Romer to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of th e ill-gotten gains that he received through his fraud, along with the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t] and Section 21 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u].

The Court has jurisdiction over this ac tion pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa].  Defendant Romer, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means or instruments of transportation or co mmunication in intersta te commerce, or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 7. Venue is proper in this Court pursuan t to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa] because certain of the acts, practices and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of the United St ates District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  In addition, during the relevant time period, Defendant Romer resided and conducted business within the Eastern District of Michigan. THE DEFENDANT 8. Ernest J. Romer, III is 57 years old and is a resident of Shelby Township, Michigan.  From October 2012 until his termination in January 2017, Romer was a registered representative associated with Co reCap Investments.  Romer held Series 7, 63 and 66 licenses.  CoreCap Investments termin ated Romer in January 2017 for engaging in undisclosed outside business activities.  In July 2017, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) barred Romer in all cap acities from association with any FINRA members.  In August of 2017, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10  - 4 - Affairs (ﬁLARAﬂ) revoked Romer™s securities agent registration, barring Romer from registration with a broker-dealer.   FACTS Romer™s Professional Background 9. Romer has been a registered representative associated with various broker- dealers since at least 1993.  Many of his customers followed Romer from broker-dealer to broker-dealer.  In 2012, Romer began wo rking for CoreCap Investments. Romer™s Offering Fraud and Misappropriation Scheme  10. In 2014, Romer began recommending that certain of his CoreCap Investments customers sell secu rities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts in the name of either P&R Capital or CoreCap Solutions.  Romer represented that he would use the f unds to make investments which would earn better returns than their current investments. Romer told some customers he would invest their funds in a variable annuity and told others he would invest in stocks or mutual funds. Based on Romer™s representations, including Ro mer™s installation of misleading signage directly behind the reception desk in the CoreCap Investme nts branch office where he worked that read ﬁCoreCap Solutions,ﬂ th e customers understood that P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were affiliated with CoreCap Investments.  11. Many of Romer™s customers were el derly retirees and unsophisticated investors.  They had most of their life sa vings invested with Romer.  Based on their decades-long relationship, the customers trusted Romer and agreed to sell securities and transfer their funds as Romer recommended. Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10  - 5 -  12. Based on Romer™s recommendations, from approximately 2014 to April 2016, customers sold securities in their Co reCap Investments account, transferred the proceeds to their personal bank accounts, and then wrote personal checks or provided  cashier™s checks to P&R Capital or CoreCap So lutions.  Romer deposited those checks into P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions bank accounts, over which he had sole control.  13. In April 2016, Romer began instructing customers to transfer money directly from their CoreCap Investments accounts to the P&R Capital bank account.  In those instances, Romer completed all the required pa perwork, had the customers sign it, and then sent it to CoreCap Investments™ back office for processing.    14. In total, approximately 22 cust omers sent $1,962,887 to P&R Capital and 11 customers sent $738,200 to CoreCap Solutions. Romer™s Misappropriation of Customer Funds  15. Contrary to Romer™s representati ons, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no re lationship to CoreCap Investments, and the customers™ money was not used to purch ase securities for the customers. 16. Instead, Romer used another join t checking account in his name to commingle the $2.7 million he raised from his customers with approximately $1.0 million  in advances that he received from Co reCap Investments, approximately $495,000 in cashier™s checks, and approximately $242,000 from other sources.  Romer used approximately $3.5 million for trading in his pe rsonal brokerage accounts, realizing trading losses, primarily from options trading, of about $3.1 million.  Romer also used approximately $714,000 of the commingled funds for personal expenses, including  mortgage payments, credit ca rds bills, shopping, college costs for his children, Detroit Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10  - 6 - Lions tickets, and cash withdrawals.  Additionally, Romer transferred approximately $41,000 to family members.  17. From the time Romer began misappropr iating his customers™ funds, he used some of their money to repay other customers at one of his former brokerage firms, who had suffered losses in a private offering in 2010 and 2011.  Eventually, Romer used  approximately $343,000 of his customers™ f unds for this fraudulent purpose.   18. Some of Romer™s CoreCap Investments customers requested that he return some of their funds.  He used funds from ot her CoreCap Investments customers to make those payments.  In total, Romer made approximately $302,000 of such Ponzi-like payments, using money he received from his victims. 19. Romer never disclosed to his CoreCap Investments customers that he would use, or had used, their funds for any of the purposes described in Paragraphs 16-18, above.   20. Romer acted deliberately, with the inte nt to deceive.  He never intended to make the investments he promised to his customers, and he never invested any of the money he raised from his customers for their benefit. 21. As a result of Romer™s false and misl eading statements, at least 30 customers transferred at least $2.7 million to Romer. Uncovering Romer™s Fraud 22. As early as mid-2015, some of Rome r™s customers began to question him about their investment returns and tax docum entation.  Romer was unable to provide the customers with any documentation relating to the investments because none of the money had been invested as promised.  Instead, Rome r told his customers various lies, including Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.6    Page 6 of 10  - 7 - that their money was safe and that he was waiting for better buying opportunities or market movement before investing on their behalf. 23. Eventually, certain of Romer™s custom ers complained to the local criminal authorities.  In September 2017, Romer was charged with embezzlement by the Macomb County Prosecutor™s Office.  In July 2018, he pled no contest to those charges, and is currently awaiting sentencing.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2014 through 2016, Ernest J. Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC. Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments. Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked. Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false. As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit. He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Romer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Wilburn Saylor of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Steven Klawans. The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Ms. Key-Patterson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Macomb County, Michigan Prosecutor's Office."

The Commission brings t his action pursuant to Section s 20(b) and 20(d) of the Securities Act [ 15 U.S. C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d) ] and Section s 21(d)  21(e) of the Exchange  [15 U.S.C. § § 78u(d)  78u(e) ]. 7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)  78aa ], and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 . 8.

Acts, practices, and courses of business constituting  violations alleged herein have occurred within the Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  2 of 15.  PageID #: 2 3  jurisdiction of t he United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere. Moreover,  Defendants transacted business in this district. Venue also is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving ris e to the claims discussed herein occurred within this distri ct [28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) ]. 9. The Defendants , directly or indirectly, made use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange in connection with the alleged acts, practices, and courses of business . DEFENDANT S 10. Jared Jeffrey Davis , born 1976 , is last known to be a resident of Sandusky, Ohio . Davis and business partner Pinchot directly or indirectly owned multiple companies and internet websites that offered binary options securities trading to investors, and Davis served as the primary manager of the overall enterprise. 11. Dale Burke Pinchot , born 1970 , is last known to be a res ident of Yardley , Pennsylvania, and was the partner of Davis in the binary options business . STATEMENT OF FACTS A. Binary Options 12. A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely on the outcome of a yes/no, or binary, proposition or event such as whether the price of a particular underlying asset ( e.g. , an individual stock, an index of stocks, a currency, a commodity) will rise above or fall below a specified amount at a specified future point in time. 13. Once the option i s acquired by the investor , there is typically no further decision for the investor to make regarding the exercise of the binary option because binary option Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  3 of 15.  PageID #: 3 4  contracts exercise automatically at expiration . 14. Unlike some other types of options, binary option contracts do not give the holder the right to buy or sell the specified underlying asset. When the binary option expires, the option holder typically receives an amount (sometimes referred to as the ﬁpayoutﬂ) that is either a pre -determined amount or a per centage return based on initial investment ( i.e. , the premium) or loses all or nearly all of his or her investment. For example, a binary option contract with Apple stock  as its underlying asset might, on the question of whether or not the price of Apple s tock will be above or below $X per share five minutes hence, offer investors terms of a 70% payout on a  winning trade or a 100% loss of capital on a losing trade. 15. Given this all -or-nothing payout structure, binary option contracts are also sometimes referr ed to as ﬁall -or-nothing optionsﬂ or ﬁfixed -return options.ﬂ 16. Binary option contracts based on securities and securities -based indices are themselves securities and thus are subject to the federal securities laws . B. The Unregistered Binary Options Industry 17. The unregistered binary options industry is often composed of three primary components sometimes referred to as ﬁplatforms, ﬂ ﬁbrands, ﬂ and ﬁaffiliate marketers. ﬂ 18. Platforms, frequently based in Israel but sometimes based in other locations, such as Bulgaria, are, as the moniker implies, the foundation of the unregistered binary options  industry. 19. Platforms offer services for a fee that other intermediaries, called brands (discussed below), purchase or license and that may include software related to ( a) trade entry and execution services, ( b) customer account and client relationship management (ﬁCRMﬂ), ( c) access to investment products ( i.e. , various binary option contracts), and ( d) back office IT Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  4 of 15.  PageID #: 4 5  support. Some platforms also provide introductions to affiliate marketers (described below). 20. Brands, also known in the unregistered binary options industry as ﬁprivate labels,ﬂ ﬁwhite labels,ﬂ or ﬁbrokers,ﬂ may be established with a relatively modest investment and typically operate under a trade name while contracting with a platform for trade, customer  account, and back office systems and services. 21. Generally, brand operators, such as  Defendants , possess custody of customer funds, do not charge commissions on trades, and are the counterp arty to each customer binary options transaction. 22. Affiliate marketers are independent entities who produce sophisticated internet marketing campaigns centered on ephemeral websites and videos promoting the purportedly  extraordinary and easy profits that ca n be obtained through binary options trading (although  some campaigns  not specifically mention binary options). 23. These internet marketing campaigns, including those hired by Davis , frequently employ false statements, false testimonials, and/or falsified trading results, created by the affiliate marketer, to lure potential victims in and to shepherd them, for a fee, to binary option  brand websites such as those operated by  Defendants . C. Economics of the Unregistered Binary Options Industry and Binary Option Brands 24. The economic basis of the unregistered binary options industry as participated in   Defendants is predicated upon the knowledge that, in the aggregate and utilizing sufficiently volatile underlying assets, investors are likely to win on ly slightly more than 50% of their trades. 25. By structuring binary option contracts such that investors will be credited, typically, with only a 70 -85% payout on winning trades and a 95 -100% loss of capital on losing Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  5 of 15.  PageID #: 5 6  trades, the binary options industry can r ely on the almost equal distribution of trade outcomes (i.e. , wins and losses) to, as with casinos, mathematically assure themselves of a profit over time. 26. Brands , such as those operated by  Defendants , derive their revenue from being the counterparty t o losing customer trades and retaining what is forfeited by customers thereby. In other words, binary option brands , such as those operated by  Defendants , have a keen interest in having their customers lose money through binary options trading. 27. To bett er ensure this profitable (to the brand) outcome, at least some platforms offered their brand customers access to software services or protocols, sometimes referred to as ﬁrisk management,ﬂ that would further increase the odds against investor customers of the brands . 28. These risk management protocols , applied at the platform level to investor account s at the req uest of the brand operator, act to increase the likelihood that a given customer™s binary option trades will ﬁloseﬂ (and the opposite can be done with the accounts of discouraged customers in order to induce them, via experiencing a limited number of winni  trades, to keep trading and/or to deposit additional funds into their binary options trading  account). 29. Thus , brands , such as those operated by  Defendants , in order to generate meaningful and ongoing revenue require three things: ( i) that customers actively trade their binary options accounts ( i.e. , so that the effects of the math underlying the payout structure have an opportunity to apply); ( ii) that that trading is unsuccessful ( i.e. , customers lose money to the brand via losing trades); and ( iii) that a constant stream of new customers is found to replace those who have either lost all of their investment capital or who have closed their account after  discovering that binary options trading is unlikely to prove a profitable long -term endeavor .  Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  6 of 15.  PageID #: 6 7  D. The Defendant s™ Binary Options Business 30. During or before early 2012, the Defendants undertook steps, including the formation of various foreign shell companies with foreign bank accounts, to establish their first binary options brand, OptionMint (www.optionm int.com). 31. Over the next few years,  Defendants established an additional three brands ŠOptionKing (www.optionking.com), Option Queen (www.optionqueen.com), and OptionPrince (www.optionprince.com) Šadditional foreign shell companies with foreign bank accou nts, and, operating at various times, three call centers (with employees ) located in Sandusky, Ohio ; Costa Rica ; and Sint Maarten. 32. This binary options enterprise, referred to hereinafter as the ﬁEnterprise, ﬂ although co -owned by  Defendants , was at all times primarily managed by D avis . 33. During the Relevant Period, t he Enterprise accepted, as customers, investors located throughout the United States and around the world and offered and sold to them binary option contracts on individual stocks, stock indice s, currencies, and commodities collecting at least $10 million (in aggregate) from them thereby of which the Defendants obtained a portion thereof . 34. The offer and sale of binary option securities (i.e. , those binary options based on securities and securitie s-based indices)   Defendants and the Enterprise was not registered with the Commission, and neither w ere the Defendants or the Enterprise registered with the Commission as either a broker or a dealer , and  were the Defendants associated with a bro  or dealer registered with the Commission . 35. In connection with the offer, purchase (by investors), and sale of binary option securities, D avis , directly or indirectly through the Enterprise, engaged in the making of Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  7 of 15.  PageID #: 7 8  misstatement s of material fact or omi tted to state material fact s necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading  obtain ed money or property from binary options securities investors thereby. For example , Davis   Enterprise marketing emails and/or in Enterprise telephone sales scripts used by Enterprise call center employees (both of which were approved  Davis ), misrepresented the number of successful binary option investors the Enterprise had  omitted the fact that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of his or her trades, (b) misrepresented the security of investor funds which were, in fact, comingled with the general funds of the Enterprise , (c) misrepresented the knowledge and experience of Enterprise employees  advised customers on binary options trading , (d) misrepresented  Enterprise™s interest in seeing its customers succeed by omitting to disclose  basic fact that the Enterprise , and thus the Defendants , effectively took the opposing position on each t rade and thus required customers to lose money via binary options trading in order for the Enterprise and the Defendants to make money , and  failed to disclose that Davis and the Enterprise could and oftentimes would increase the odds against customer success  application of risk management protocols . 36. Davis also engaged in misstatements and omissions in the Terms & Conditions section of the OptionMint website (which he controlled). For example, although this section contained a risk disclosure statement, it was silent on the ability of Davis , via the Enterprise,  have risk management protocols applied to the accounts of winning customers. Similarly, although th is section contained a disclosure that ﬁbonus money ﬂ (an inducement, such as, for example, a matching $500 credit on a $500 deposit made in order to lure wavering prospective customers into opening and funding a binary options account) must be t urned over (i.e. , traded) 30 times before it could be withdrawn by the customer , it was silent on the fact that, Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  8 of 15.  PageID #: 8 9  mathematically, an investor was likely to lose all of his or her investment capital prior to achieving this turnover level. Finally, although t his section discussed OptionMint™s ﬁknow-your -customer ﬂ policy and the supposed need for obtaining certain identifying documents from customers , it was silent about the fact that Davis, via the Enterprise , could and would use those documents against custom   attempt ed to effect a debit/credit card chargeback once they realized that they had been misinformed about the realities of binary option s trading. 37.

PageID #: 15","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an Ohio resident and his Pennsylvania business partner in connection with an unregistered and fraudulent binary options business.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jared Jeffrey Davis and various shell companies controlled by Davis and his business partner, Dale Burke Pinchot, engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered binary option securities under the brand names OptionMint, OptionKing, Option Queen, and OptionPrince. According to the complaint, Davis misrepresented the number of investors who successfully traded binary options and failed to disclose that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of trades. The complaint alleges that Davis, Pinchot, and their companies effectively took the opposing position on each trade and therefore made money when customers entered into losing binary options trades. The complaint further alleges that Davis failed to inform investors that he frequently manipulated the options trading software to increase the odds of investor losses.  To learn more about binary options fraud, see Investor Alert: Binary Options Websites may be Used for Fraudulent Schemes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio, charges Davis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and charges Pinchot with violating antifraud provision Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis and Pinchot consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any binary option security. The final judgments provide that the court will determine disgorgement and civil penalties at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio announced criminal charges against Davis on June 5, 2018.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by James Thibodeau and Justin Sutherland of the Commission's Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley. The litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
16,"IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA § SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, §         § Plaintiff, §         § v.        § Case No. __________            §  1POOL LTD. a.k.a. 1BROKER  § PATRICK BRUNNER ,     §         §   Defendant s.      §         §  COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ( ﬁSEC ﬂ), for its Complaint against Defendant s 1pool Ltd. a.k.a. 1Broker (ﬁ1Brokerﬂ) and Patrick Brunner (ﬁBrunnerﬂ) (collectively, ﬁDefendantsﬂ) , alleges: SUMMARY 1. From at least 2012 until September 2018,  Defendants have illegally offer ed and sold security -based swaps to U.S. investors through their website 1broker.com while failing to file a registration statement with the SEC .  As 1Broker™s CEO and sole shareholder, Brunner controls 1Broker and its operations .  He is also the developer of the 1broker.com platform. 2. On the 1broker.com website, the Defendants market the security -based swaps as ﬁCFDsﬂ Šwhich is an acronym for ﬁcontracts for difference .ﬂ  Through  se CFD s, 1Broker accountholders can participate in the price movements of securities and other assets without actually owning the underlying asset. For example, an accountholder can purchase a long or short position in a CFD that tracks the price of the stock of a publicly -traded U.S. company .  Then, depending on whether the stock price goes up or down, the value of the CFD will also go Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 1 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 2 Complaint up or down.  1Broker is the counterparty on every CFD , meaning it takes the opposite position of the accountholder on every CFD .  For example, if the accountholder takes a long position, 1Broker takes the corresponding short position . 3. Because the value s of the CFD s are tied to the value s of underlying securities, market indices, or other financial as sets or benchmarks, they are security -based swaps under  federal securities laws. Absent certain exceptions (which do not apply here), t he federal securities laws require that offerings in security -based swaps be registered with the SEC and that  transaction s be executed on a registered national exchange .  Likewise, 1Broker Šwhich acted as a dealer in the CFDs Šwas required to register with the SEC.  Because neither the CFDs nor 1Broker was registered and because the transactions were not executed on a national exchange, the Defendants violated the federal securities laws .  Brunner, who controlled 1Broker and directed its activities , was a culpable participant in 1Broker™s violations. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The  brings this action under Section 20 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Act ﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)]  Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Act ﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], seeking to permanently restrain and enjoin  Defendants from engaging in the unlawfu l acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein. 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Section s 22(a) and (c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § § 77v(a) and (c) ] and Section 27  -(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 6. The Defendant s, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails or of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices,  courses of business described in this Complaint . Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 2 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 3 Complaint 7. Venue is proper because   nsactions, acts, practices, and  courses of business described below occurred within the District of Columbia . PARTIES 8. Plaintiff  is an agency of the United States of America charged with enforcing the federal securities laws. 9. Defendant Brunner, age 2 6, resides principally in Austria.  He  1Broker™s CEO, sole shareholder, and the only person authorized to represent the company. He also developed 1Broker™s software platform. 10. Defendant 1Broker is a limited liability company registered as 1pool Ltd. in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Although the entity was registered in 2015, Brunner and 1Broker have utilized and maintained the 1broker.com website since 2012. FACTS A. The Defendants offer security -based swaps to U.S. investors . 11. Since at least 2012, the Defendants have offered CFDs through the ir 1broker.com website , which is publicly available to anyone in the U.S . with internet access. Using the website , a person can op en an account by simply providing an email address and creating a user name .  Accountholders are not required to provide  additional information Šsuch as full legal name, address, purpose of account, source of funds, etc. 12. In order to buy and sell CFDs, accountholder s must first fund their accounts. Only one form of funding is accepted Šthe digital currency Bitcoin.  Likewise, all payments made by 1Broker  accountholder s are made in bitcoin s. 13. Once  account is funded, the accountholder can tra de CFDs. The value of the CFDs is based on the value of corresponding asset s.  These assets include U.S. exchange -listed Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 3 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 4 Complaint stocks, commodities, and foreign -exchange pairs.  As explained on the 1broker.com website: ﬁ[u]nlike with options or other complex instruments t he CFD price is one to one with the underlying market.  You can trade them virtually feeless and faster than shares, options or futures.ﬂ  1 broker .com also states that it provides accountholder s ﬁa selection of various current trade rates of certain securities [–and t]he depiction of these Markets is based on current data from the exchanges and is updated on an ongoing basis.ﬂ 14. When trading the CFDs, accountholder s select whether they want to take a long or short position.  Accountholders who purchase a ﬁlongﬂ CFD profit if the price of the corresponding asset or index increases.  Accountholders who purchase a ﬁshortﬂ CFD profit if the price of the corresponding investment decreases. Like stocks on publicly -traded exchanges , all purchases and sales of CFDs are subject to a bid -ask spread Šdescribed as a ﬁone -time feeﬂ that 1Broker collects on transactions. 15. 1Broker also uses stock exchange terminology and provides broker -dealer functionality for opening and closing investment positions.  For example, 1bro ker.com includes a page labeled ﬁMarkets.ﬂ Within the Markets page, a ccount holders are presented with a series of choices Šincluding Indices, Stocks, Commodities, Forex , and Crypto. Within these markets, accountholders can choose to trade individual CFDs that fall within these categories. 16. If an accountholder selects a stock from the menu of choices on 1broker.com, 1Broker provides various information about that company™s stock.  This includes   . exchange ticker symbol, real -time bid and ask prices qu oted in U.S. dollars, maximum leverage amount, a stock price chart, and buttons labeled ﬁLongﬂ and ﬁShort.ﬂ 1Broker offers a wide array of CFDs with corresponding U.S. -based equities. For example, an accountholder Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 4 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 5 Complaint considering a CFD in Bank of America Cor p. common stock would see a screen that looks similar to this: 17. 1Broker acts as the counterparty on every CFD trade.  This means that when an accountholder takes a position in a CFD, 1Broker takes the other side of the trade (e.g., if an accountholder tak es a long position in a stock, 1Broker takes the corresponding short position). 18. The CFDs are security -based swaps as defined by the federal securities laws.  Securities Act and  Exchange Act define a ﬁsecurity -based swapﬂ in relevant part    eement, contract, or transaction that is based on a single security or the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or extent of an occurrence of an event relating to a single issuer of a security , provided that such event directly affects the financial statements, fina ncial condition, or financial obligations of the issuer.  15 U.S.C § 77b(a)(17); 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(68); 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18). Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 5 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 6 Complaint B. The Defendants illegally offer the CFDs without registering with the SEC . 19. In order to protect investors, the federal securities laws require that securities offerings be registered with the SEC (absent an exemption ).  For the same reason, absent a n exemption, securities dealers are required to register with the SEC.  The Defendants failed to comply with these registratio n requirements. 20. Security -based swaps are securities under the federal securities laws.  As detailed above, the CFDs Šwhich have their value tied to stocks Šare security -based swaps .  They are also, therefore, securities Šand may not be offered or sold in the U.S. unless a registration statement has been filed with the SEC .  The Defendants failed to file a registration statement. 21. 1Broker offered and sold these security -based swaps through 1broker.com. Investors from across the world Šincluding the U.S .Šhad access to the website. Although 1Broker and Brunner had the ability to restrict users ™ access to the website, as they did with Austrian investors, they continued to offer and sell these security -based swaps on the 1broker.com platform.  Br unner created the platform for the offer and sale, and personally corresponded with investors about the company and specific aspects of the CFDs. 22. U.S. investors traded the CFDs through 1broker.com. For example, a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Inves tigation, acting in an undercover capacity (the ﬁUC Agentﬂ), accessed the 1broker.com website while physically located in Houston, Texas and opened an account by providing only an email address and password.  The UC Agent then funded the account using bitc oins. Later , while physically located in Washington, D.C., the UC Agent logged into 1broker.com and bought and sold CFDs that track the price of the common stock of Ford Motor Company. Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 6 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 7 Complaint 23. The UC Agent made all of the following trades at 1broker.com :1 Date Time (EST)  Action Location 03/30/2016 11:25:17AM WU Buy Houston 03/30/2016 11:28:14AM WU Sell Houston 03/30/2016 11:34:02AM WU Buy Houston 03/31/2016 10:15:46AM WU Sell Houston 05/03/2016 2:28:33PM GPRO  Houston 05/03/2016 3:07:57PM GPRO Sell Houston 07/05/2016 11:33:24AM GPRO  Houston 07/05/2016 3:49:09PM GPRO Sell Houston 12/12/2016 2:14:24PM F Buy D.C. 12/12/2016 2:38:40PM F Sell D.C. 12/13/2016 9:31:06AM F Buy D.C. 12/13/2016 11:29:24AM F Sell D.C. 24. 1Broker and Brunner did not determine whether accountholders met certain discretionary trading thresholds.  unregistered sale of security -based swaps is legal when the sales are limited to ﬁeligible contract participantsﬂ Šwhich are high -net -worth indivi duals and certain types of sophisticated and/or regulated entities.  The sales of 1Broker CFDs were not so limited. 25. Similarly, the CFD transactions were not effected on a registered national securities exchange, as required.  Instead, all of the sales too k place through the 1broker.com website Šwhich is not registered in the U.S. 26. Finally, 1Broker illegally operate s as an unregistered dealer .  The federal securities laws require that any dealer register with the SEC.  A dealer is any person (including an ent  ) engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for the person™s own account. Although certain exemptions apply to security -based swaps dealers, because 1Broker dealt in 1 The UC Agent took a long position in each of these trades. The CFD ticker symbols are: The Western Union Company (WU), GoPro Inc. (GPRO), and Ford Motor Company. Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 7 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker Page 8 Complaint security -based swaps with non -eligible contract participants, it cannot avail itself of this exemption. 27. Because it participated in every transaction as the counterparty, 1Broker was in the business of buying and selling CFDs for its own account. 1Broker charged a ﬁfeeﬂ on each transaction in the form of a bid -ask spread. Thousands of accountholders , including U.S investors, have utilized 1Broker™s platform to transact in millions of dollars of bitcoin across their 1Broker trading accounts. 28. In addition, 1Broker describes itself as the ﬁmarket makerﬂ for the CFDs. 29. Despite the fact that it was acting as a dealer, 1Broker failed to register with the SEC.  In failing to do so, it violated the federal securities laws. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF First Claim Violations of Section  ) of the Securities Act 30.

According to the SEC's complaint, 1pool Ltd. a/k/a 1Broker, registered in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and its CEO Patrick Brunner solicited investors from the United States and around the world to buy and sell security-based swaps. Investors could open accounts by simply providing an email address and a user name - no additional information was required - and could only fund their account using bitcoins. The SEC alleges that a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity, successfully purchased several security-based swaps on 1Broker's platform from the U.S. despite not meeting the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws. The SEC also alleges that Brunner and 1Broker failed to transact its security-based swaps on a registered national exchange, and failed to properly register as a dealer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges 1Broker and Brunner with violating registration provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 5(e) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 6(l) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties. In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced charges against 1Broker arising from similar conduct.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Hirsch and Morgan Ward Doran, and supervised by Scott Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Chris Davis and supervised by B. David Fraser. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the CFTC.  Note: This litigation release was amended on November 21, 2019, to clarify the SEC's charges."
53,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, v.TEMENOS ADVISORY, INC., and GEORGE L. TAYLOR, Defendants. Case No. JURY TRIAL DEMANDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁthe Commissionﬂ)alleges the following against Defendants Temenos Advisory , Inc. (ﬁTemenos"")and its principal, George L. Taylor (ﬁTaylorﬂ),and hereby demands a jury trial: SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 1.Temenos is a Connecticut-based investme nt adviser and Taylor is the majority owner of Temenos and also holds several positions at the firm, including chief executive officer (ﬁCEOﬂ).  From 2014 through 2017, Temenos and Ta ylor defrauded their advisory clients and prospective clients by steering the clients into unsuitable investments and by hiding commissions and other financial incentives th at Temenos and Taylor were poc keting, on top of the advisory fees that the clients were paying for supposedly unbiased financial advice. Temenos and Taylor repeatedly downplayed or concealed risks, and overstated potential gains, associated with a series of illiquid private placements that they advised their clie nts and prospective clients to invest in.  In so doing, Defendants promoted the investments and pocketed commissionsŠa Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 1 of 43 2percentage of each client™s investmentŠfrom the private placement companies, thereby illegally acting as unregistered broker-dealers. 2.Through their conduct, Temenos and Taylor violated the fiduciary duty that every investment adviser owes to its c lients and prospective clientsŠto put client interests first,to deal with clients with the utmost honesty, to disclose all conf licts or potential conf licts of interest, and to use reasonable care in providi ng investment advice.  Instead, Defendants ignored their clients™ interests and biased their inve stment advice to put money in their own pockets.The advisory clients and other investors harmed by the Defendants included reta il investors, and some of the harmed investors were senior citizens or individuals approaching retirement who invested money  from their retirement funds or pension plans into the private investments recommended by the  Defendants. 3.In connection with steering clients into four private placement investments, Temenos and Taylor breached their fiduciary duty to advisory clients and prospective clients by: failing to perform due diligence commensurate with even minimal fiduciary obligations (such as reviewing full financial information and investigating the truth of claims made by the issuers); failing to disclose known defects that came to their attention, such as:a company™s poor financial condition, que stionable spending prac tices, potential liabilities, misstatements and omissions in the compan ies™ marketing materials, and dubious claims by one company about its technology; aggressively pushing advisory clients to invest in securities in which Temenos and Taylor had undisclosed conflicts; Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 2 of 43 3recommending investments that they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, were not suitable or appropriatefo r particular investors; grosslyunderstatingsignificant risks of investing in private placementsgenerally; intentionally making numerous materially false and misleading statements and materially incomplete disclosures concerning the potential risks, returns, and value of particular private placements; failing to disclose Temenos™s own failing financial condition; giving preferential treatment to a partia l owner of Temenos (the trust for which Taylor served as trustee), by permitting it to redeem its principal investment in an illiquid investment(a privilege denied to other clients); and overcharging clients™ advisory fees by overv aluing the private placement investments, in violation of Temenos™s own written policies. 4.Temenos and Taylor also played an extensive role in soliciting the private placement investmentsin exchange for commissions from the private companies.  In doing so, they illegally acted as unregistered broker-dealers when selling those investments. 5.Through the activities alleged in this Complaint,Temenosand Taylor,while acting as investment advisers,have employed devices, schemes and artif ices to defraud their investment advisory clients and have engaged in acts, transac tions, practices and courses of businesses which operated as a fraud on their i nvestment advisory clie nts,in violation of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advi sers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvise rs Actﬂ).  Temenos violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Actand Rule 206(4)-7 thereunderby failing to implement its written valuation policy.Taylor aided and abe tted that violation.  And,Temenos Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 3 of 43 4and Taylor violated Section 15(a) of the Secu rities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) by inducing and attempting to induce the purchase and sa le of securities without being registered as a broker or dealer or being associated with a registered broker or dealer 6.The Commission seeks: a.entry of appropriate permanent in junctions, including an injunction prohibiting Defendants from further violations of the relevant provisions of  the federal securities laws; b.disgorgement of Defendants™ill-gotten gains, pluspre-judgment interest; and, c.imposition of civil penaltiesdue to the egregious nature of Defendants™ violations. JURISDICTIONAND VENUE 7.The Commission seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement pursuant to Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act [15U.S.C. §80b-9(d)]and Section21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)].The Commission seeks the imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to Section 209(e) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §80b-9(e)]andSection 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)]. 8.The Court has jurisdiction over this acti on pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78aa]and Sections 209(d), 209(e) and 214 of the Advisers Act [15U.S .C. §§80b-9(d), 80b-9(e), 80b-14]. 9.Venue is proper in this District because , at all relevant time s,Temenos and Taylor operated as investment advisersa nd served advisory clients in C onnecticut.  In addition, the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business constituting the alleged violations occurredin  Connecticut.Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 4 of 43 510.In connection with the co nduct described in this Complaint, Defendants directly or indirectly made use of the mails or th e means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce. 11.Defendants™conduct involved fraud, deceit, or deliberate or reckless disregard of regulatory requirements, and resulted in substantial loss, or significant risk of substantial loss, to  other persons.DEFENDANTS 12.Temenos Advisory, Inc. is a Connecticut corporation founded by Taylor with its principal place of business in Litchfield, Connectic ut and additional offices in St. Simons Island, Georgia, and Scottsdale, Arizona.  Temenos has been registered with the Commission as an  investment adviser since 1999, and is owned by George Taylor anda trust that was set up for the benefit of Taylor™s former business partner. 13.George L. Taylor ,age 62, is a resident of Litchf ield, Connecticut.  Taylor is the CEO, founder, Chief Compliance Officer, and majo rity owner of Temenos.  Taylor is also a registered representative of a broker-dealer th at is not affiliated with Temenos.Taylor is registered as aGeneral Securities Representative, aGeneral Securities Principal, an Investment  CompanyProducts/Variable Contracts Principa l, and aUniform Securities Agentwith the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency. Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 5 of 43 6STATEMENT OF FACTS A.Defendants Took Money to Recommend th e Securities of Private Placement Companies, and Did So Without Conducting Adequate Due Diligence 14.Before 2014, Temenos and Taylor had inve sted their advisory clients™ money primarily in mutual funds, exchange traded funds, variable annuities, and p ublicly traded stocks. They charged an asset management fee to their clients based on the clients™ total assets under their management. 15.Starting in 2014, Temenos and Taylor be gan actively recommending the privately offered securities of four private companies to Temenos™s clients and prospective clients.  Between 2014 and 2017, Defendants placed more than $19million in investments by their  clients and others inthese four private issuers™ securities. And they did so without ever sufficiently examining the marketing claims, financial statements, or the business activities of  those companies. 16.Critically, by steering their clients™ investments into those securities of the four private companies, Temenos and Taylor arranged to covertlycollect commissions (a percentage of the amount invested) on top of the asset manage ment fees their clients were already paying for unbiased advice.  Although their due diligence wa s inadequate, their fina ncial incentives to recommend these private securities offerings were not. 1.Temenos and Taylor Agreedto Commi ssion-Based Solicitation Agreements with Private Placement Companies 17.Defendants recommended their clients invest in the securities offerings of at least four private companies: Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 6 of 43 718.CompanyA marketedan emergency respons e communications product. Beginning on or about April 25, 2013, Company Aengaged in a private placement securities  offering. 19.Temenos and Taylorsolicite d investments in Company A.  Between February 2014 and February2017,Temenos solicited approxima tely $11.2million of investments in Company Afrom their advisory clients and othe rindividuals(certain of whom later became advisory clientsof Temenos).From Septembe r 2014 through February 2017, pursuant to a ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ agreement with Company A, Temenos solicited investments in  Company A as its ﬁfinder.ﬂ  From October 2014 through February 2017, Company A  compensated Temenos for Temenos™s role in the private placement.Temenos, at Taylor™s  direction and under his signature as CEO, ente redintoa ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ with Company A, effective September 1, 2014.  Under that ag reement, Temenos receive d money equal to 2.5% of each investment it brought to Company A.  On September 9, 2015, Temenos and Company A  extended that agreement and changed the comp ensation that Temenos received.  Under the extended agreement, Temenos received 5% of each investment it brought to Company A. 20.Company B purportedto be building a fiber opt ic connection between locations along the east coast of the UnitedStates.Beg inning on or about January 15, 2015, Company B engaged in a private placement securities offering. 21.Temenos and Taylor solic ited investments in Company B.  Between September 2014and March 2017, Temenos solic ited approximately $7 million of client investments in Company B. From January 2015 to August 2015, Temenos solicited investments in Company B through a solicitation arrangement with aninterm ediary.  Temenos, at Taylor™s direction and Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 7 of 43 8under his signature, entered into a ﬁNon-Ex clusive Placement Agency Agreementﬂ with Company B effective August 1, 2015.Under that agreement, Temenos received a fee equal to  5% in cash and 5% in equity(that is, an ownership stake in Company B)of each investment  brought to Company B.  From September 2015 through February 2017,Company B  compensated Temenos directly for Temenos™s role in the solicitations. 22.Company C marketed itselfduring the relevant time periodas a crowdfunding investment portal.Company C™s f ounder and president is a former registered representative of a broker-dealer.Prior to founding Company C, he owned a companythat had a solicitation agreement with CompanyB.Company Cemploys Taylor™s wife as Managing Director,  Customer Experience.  Prior to that, she served as Principal Director of Investor Strategies.  She  received stock options in Company C as part of her compensation.  For a short time, Defendant Taylor served on Company C™s investment co mmittee.  Beginning on or about March 18, 2016, Company Cengaged in a private placement securities offering. 23.Temenosand Taylor solicite d investments in Company C.  Between March 2016 and January 2017, Defendants solicited $805,000 of client investment in Company C. 24.In the meantime, shortly after Temenos and Taylor began soliciting investments in Company C from their clients, Temenos and Ta ylor began to receive undisclosed payments from Company C.  On July 6, 2016,Company C™s CEO confirmed that Temenos would receive a fee equal to 7% of each investment it br ought to Company C in cash, and 5% more in Company C equity.  On July 15, 2016, Company C offered Taylor an additional financial incentive to solicit investments, promising Ta ylor an additional 25,000 options on purchasing Company C stock once Defendants had suc cessfully solicited $500,000 of investments for Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 8 of 43 9Company C.  The email between the CEO and Ta ylor acknowledges that Temenos would have Temenos™s advisory clients invested in Compan y C,and that Taylor would also be marketing Company C to non-clients as well to people ﬁb eyond [Taylor™s] own contacts.ﬂFrom August 2016 through December 2016, Company C compensa ted Temenos for Temenos™s solicitations. In December 2016, Temenos, at Taylor™s direc tion and under his signature, entered into a ﬁFinders (sic) Agreementﬂ with Company C, re troactively effective as of February 10, 2016. Under that agreement, Temenos received money e qual to 7% of each investment itbrought to Company C. 25.Company D purported to have developed a ne w water purification technology. In or around early August 2015, approximately one month after two of the three Temenos advisory clients who invested in Company Dhad completed their investments,the owners of Company D™s parent companyfired Company D™s president, and withdrew all the money from  Company D™s checking account. 26.Temenos and Taylor solicited $225,000of c lient investments in Company D. From in or about December 2014 to in orabout July 2015, Temenos, through Taylor, solicited investments in Company D.  Taylor expected that Company D would pay Temenos a 5% finder™s fee for investments in Company D from Temenos clients. 2.Despite Their Representations, Defendants Failed to Conduct Even the Basic Due DiligenceNecessary to Determine Whether the Private Placement  Investments Were Suita ble for Its Clients 27.Throughout the relevant period, Taylor made statements to clients that misleadingly suggested that the private pla cement investments Temenos offered had been carefully vetted and selected from a large group of potential offerings based on their favorable Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 9 of 43 10risk/return potential, and were suitable for any we althy investor.  They weren™t.  Defendants did not perform adequate due diligence before recommending that advisory clients invest in the  private placement companies.  Instead, they r ecommended those investments without even the most basic information on the companies necessary to judge the risks and rewards of those  investmentsand with a reckless disregard for the truth of their st atements about those investments.28.Defendants repeatedly represented that they had performed due diligence on the private placement investments a nd that the investments were suitable for their clients.  For instance: a.In emails sent to clients and other prospective investors in December 2014, May 2015, and December 2015, Taylor wrote, ﬁWe are fortunate to see many  opportunities in the private equity space. We try to select those which are lower risk (all private equity is risky), thos e which exhibit exceptional return potential and those which are helping to ma ke our country a better place.ﬂ b.On May 7, 2015, Defendants emailed num erous advisory clients and others soliciting themfor an investment in Company B informing clients that Temenos  sees many opportunities to invest in priv ate companies and tries to select those which are lower risk, exhibit exceptiona l return potential, and help make the country a better place. c.In a December 2016 email to advisory client s and others, Taylor stressed that all of Temenos™s private issuer securities o fferings ﬁhave strong management teams and compelling business models.ﬂ Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 10 of 43 11d.In a February 2017 email to advisory c lients and others, Taylor stated, ﬁwe don™t recommend every investment that we have access too [sic]. . . we have a process of due diligence and vetting.ﬂ In making these claims about the selection of investment opportunities, Defendants failed to notify investors that, in fact, they had not indepe ndently assessed the risk or return potential of these companies.  Moreover, Defendants omitted to mention a key selection criterion for the  private companies in questionŠthe willingness of t hose companies to pay Taylor for every client dollar steered to those companies. 29.Defendants recommended advi sory clients and prospectiv e clients invest in these private companies without doing sufficient due diligence to determine the risk of those investments, the financial stability of those companies, the business prospects of the companies,  or the suitability of the investments for particular clients.  They forwarded emails from these  companies to their advisory clients and prospe ctive clients without performing even minimal due diligence, withoutadequate effort to determine th e accuracy of the representations they were sending to advisory clients, a nd with reckless disregard for the truth of those representations. For instance: a.Defendants did not review financial st atements for Company B prior to touting Company B to clients and prospective clie nts.  Defendants began placing client funds into Company B in January 2015, well before they ever saw Company B™s  financial information.Whe n, much later, in July 2015, Defendants saw full financial information about Company B, they discovered that Company B did not Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 11 of 43 12have enough money to build the fiber optic line itclaimed to be building, and was using most of its money for marketing instead. b.Defendants failed to discoverand/or disclosethat, between March 2015 and March 2016, several lawsuits were filed against Company B and that Company B lost control of a key land parcel, whic h significantly jeopardized Company B™s ability to build its fiber optic line; c.Defendants did not conduct due dilig ence on Company Cbefore recommending their clients invest.  Instead Defe ndants relied only on their uninformed, subjective opinion thatCompany C had good legal counsel and a good  compliance firm. d.Defendants™ due diligence on Company D was limited to reading the company™s business plan and sending that informati on to a couple of Defendants™ clients who were engineers.  One of those engineer clients bluntly notif ied Defendants that CompanyD™stechnology was ﬁa bunch of crap.ﬂ  Taylor also declined an  invitation from Company Dfor Taylor to visit the Company Dfacility and view  its technology. e.On June 28, 2015,Taylor emailed a prospective investor, unreservedly recommending an investment in Compan y D and asking for more investment money based onhis great results.  Without having conducted due diligence on the company, Taylor wrote that, ﬁ– by July they will be increasing the value of the  company from 10 million val[uation]to $100 mil l[ion]ﬂ and represented that the company would sell every unitthey make and become a dominant ﬁindustry Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 12 of 43 13disruptorﬂ that would be an ﬁ$8 billion business.ﬂTaylor also statedthatthe odds wereﬁ[o]ver 60% that technology will wo rk as claimedﬂ and ﬁ[i]t succeeds you will get at least 10 to 25 times your investment–.ﬂHe had no basis for either the  supposed calculation of the odds the technol ogy would work or for the expected return on investment if it did.30.Defendants also disregarded negative information contained in the financial statementsof some of the private companies, and failed to disclose this negative information to  advisory clientsor prospective clientswhen they solicited them to invest.  For instance, Defendants knew that Company Bhad been ra pidly using up its available cashand may be facing insolvency, but nevertheless recomme nded their clients invest in Company Band collected its resulting commissions. 31.Defendants failed to corroborate the claims they later made to advisory clients and others about the private placement companies. Defendantsdid notobtain sufficient information to determine the merits and suitability of the private companiesas investments they  recommended to their advisory clients and prospe ctive clients.  Nor did they corroborate the information they received from the private placement companiesin connection with their provision of investment advice.  Instead, in many cases, Defendants blindly forwarded and/or parroted informationreceivedfrom the privat eplacementcompanies.Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care, failed to conduct su fficient due diligence , failed to make an investigation that would provide them with a re asonable basis to believe their representations about the private placement companieswere tr ue and accurate, andfailed to obtain the Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 13 of 43 14information necessary to determine whether the investments were suitable for their current and prospective advisory clients. 3.Defendants Failed Adequately to Inform Clients thatThey Were Getting Paid by the RecommendedPrivate Placement Companies, On Topof the  Clients™ Advisory Fees 32.Though they were actively engaged in, and compensated for, soliciting investments in the private placement compan ies, prior to March 31, 2015, Temenos did not disclose to its advisory clients that it received compensation from the private placement  companies.Registered investment advisers are required to file with the Commission a document called the Form ADV, which is a uniform form used to register with the Commission or, in some instances, a statesecurities regula tor.  Form ADV contains a va riety of disclosures about the adviser and its advisory business that must be updated at least annually.  Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 26, 2014, ma kes no mention of private placement or private equity investments.   Beginning in March 2015, Teme nos includedagenericdisclosure in its Form ADVabout the possibility that it might receive ﬁfi nder™s feesﬂ for private equity investments. Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 31, 2015, states, ﬁ[w]e have and may receive  finder™s or consulting fees for recommending certain private placements or private equity deals.  Typically these are only done with accredited investors whom we decide these types of investments are suitable for.ﬂ  In its Form sADVPart II,datedJanuary 15, 2016and March 31, 2017,Temenos provided slightly more disclosure ,statingthat:ﬁWe may get paid a finder™s fee or consulting fee for offering these typeof [private] investments to our clients –.  Our  compensation will vary, but typically has ranged from zero to 10%.  This could include cash or  stock compensation.ﬂ Temenos™s Form ADV Part II general disclosure about the possibility of Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 14 of 43 15receiving compensation was, at be st, a half-truth, failingto alert c lients that Temenos and Taylor were pocketing commissions whenthey put clients in to particular private offerings, even while the clients were paying advisory fees.  Such general disclosures were insufficient to enable clients to make an informed decision on whether to invest in a particular security, or to retain Temenos as an adviser.  While after March 31, 2015, Temenos ha d generally disclosed that it ﬁmayﬂ receive a finder™s or consulting fee, it failed to tell clients and prospective clients that it, in fact, was routinely receiving feesfor investments in the private placement offeringsand that  the fees were many times larger than the advisory fees the clients were paying for advice.  Nor  did Temenos notify clientswhen Temenos and/or Taylor were being compensated by receiving ownership interests in the companies, and what ef fect that conflict of in terest had on Temenos™s investment advice.  33.In particular, Defendants repeatedly failed altogether to tell clients that Defendants were getting paid by the private companies at the times when Defendants were  soliciting and investing clients™ f unds in those companies™ offeri ngs.  For instance, on March 6 and 19, 2015;May 7and 23, 2015; June 23, 2016;August 2, 2016;November 25, 2016;and  December 27, 2016,Defendants sent emails to numer ous advisory clients and otherprospective investors soliciting investments in Company B.These emails did not disclose that Temenos  expected to receive as compensation from Compan y B a percentage of the amount invested, nor was this information disclosed to those w ho expressed interest in the investments. 34.The disclosures Defendants did make were incomplete and misleading.  For example, on December 10, 2014, Defendants disclosed to approximately 35 a dvisory clients that Temenos would receive as compensation 3% of the amount investedin Company B.Numerous Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 15 of 43 16additional prospective investors received only later emails, which did not contain any such disclosure. By August 1, 2015, Temenos™scomp ensation from Company Bhad increased to 5% of the amount invested, but Defenda nts did not disclose the increase, even to those who had been told about the 3% fee.Nor did Defendants later disclose this informa tion to clients who they recommended invest in Company B. 35.On August 15, 2015, Defendants emailednum erous advisory clients and others soliciting investments in Company A.This email did not disclose that Temenos expected to  receive a percentage of the amount i nvested in CompanyAfrom Company Aas compensation.On September 23, 2015;Novemb er 19, 2015; December 4, 2015; January 13, 2016; April 22, 2016; May 16, 2016;June 20, 2016; August 17, 25,and 31, 2016; September 30,  2016; October 17, 2016;November 25, 2016; December 27, 2016;and January 10, 2017, Defendants sent additional emails tonumerous Temenos advisory clients soliciting investments  in Company A.  None of these emails disclosed that Temenos expected to receive as  compensation a percentage of the amount invest ed.Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients whothey recommendedinvestin Company A. 36.On August 2, 2016;September 19, 2016;October 18, 2016;December 27, 2016; January 23, 2017;and January 26, 2017, Defendants emailed numerous advisory clients and others soliciting investments in Company C.Several of these emails attached Company C  marketing materials.  Defendants did not disclose that Temenos expected to receive as  compensation from Company C a percentage of th e amount invested in Company C.  Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients who were considering investing in Company Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 16 of 43 17C.  The January 23, 2017 email also disclosed th at the CEO of Company C was associated with Temenos, but inaccuratelyreferred to him as an ﬁSEC advisor.ﬂ 37.Defendants failed to disclose several other actual or pot ential conflicts of interest to clients and potential clients when recommending investments in the private offerings.  For instance: a.Defendants did not disclose to clients that both Temenos and Taylor, personally, were under financial stress and were st ruggling to meet operating expenses when they recommended that clients invest in securities for which they received, as  compensation, a commission based upon the amount invested. b.Defendants did not disclose their expect ed ownership interests in Company B or Taylor™s expected ownership interests (or, for certain clients solicited at the end of 2016,Taylor™s wife™s ownership interest sin the form of equity options)in Company Cwhenadvising their clients about Company B, Company C,or  Company C-related investments, when soliciting their clients for investment in  Company C, or when recommending their clients invest in securities offered  through Company C™s crowd-fundingplatform. c.Defendants did not disclose that Taylor had become actively involved in helping the management of Company Bas a member of Company B™s Finance  Committee,and, for a time,was part of an ﬁadvisory committeeﬂ for Company C. 38.By failing to disclose this information to advisory clients and prospective clients who were solicited to invest in these companies, while holding themselves out as investment Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 17 of 43 18advisers, Defendants intentionall y made fraudulent misrepresentati ons and material omissions to those clients and prospective clients. 4.Defendants Improperly Placed Client s in Unsuitable and Highly Risky Investments39.Defendants recommended the private placement companyinvestments to  of theirinvestor clientswho they believed to have sufficient income, regardless of whether those risky investments were right for a particular c lient.  They emailed numer ous advisory clients, recommending thatclients invest in the private companies™ securities, without concern for the clients™ personal circumstances or risk tolerance.  For example: a.In June 2016, Taylor told over 100client s by email that, ﬁ[m]utual funds and separate accounts are expensive and ineffi cient. . .ﬂ and ﬁ[w]ith our accredited investors, private equityis a key compone nt to increase potential return and to decrease overall risk.ﬂ b.On February 13, 2017, Defendants sent a ma ss email to Temenos clients stating, ﬁ[w]e believe that wealthy investor s should have some private equity investment–.ﬂ and, ﬁ[i]ncluding more a nd different types of private equity companies increases the odds that one will be successful in this asset class Œas in  all others.ﬂ  Defendants should not have been soliciting from thei r entire client base to invest in the private companies™ securitiesŠinvestments which were inherently high risk and illiquid with a long-  term and indefinite time horizon. 40.Defendants continually recommended these private placement investments to specific advisory clients and prospective clients regardless of the suitability of the investments Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 18 of 43 19for that client.  For several clients whom De fendantsconvinced to invest in those private placementofferings, those investmentswere wholly unsuitable when considering the clients™  inability to tolerate the risk of losing money on the private placement investments and when  considering the time by which the clients would need to liquidate their investments to use the  invested funds.  For instance, Defendants placed two-thirds of one partic ularclient™s retirement funds into private placement investments.  This client, a52-year-old womanwith arisk averse investment approach,had transferred to Teme nos all of her retiremen t funds(approximately $350,000), which had previously been invested in a diverse portfolio ofmutual funds and publicly traded common stock.  Defendants advised her to sell most of those investments in order to invest in three of the private placementinvestments.  Taylor told the client that the  investments would earn her a higher rate of return for the fiftee n years she plannedto continue working.  The client knew the companies she ha d invested in were not yet publiclytraded, but did not understandthe risks associated with inve sting in private placements.  Defendantsdid not explain to her thatthese private placements we","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut investment advisory firm and its chief executive officer with putting $19 million of investor money, including elderly investors' retirement savings and pension plans, in risky investments and secretly pocketing hefty commissions from those investments.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Temenos Advisory, Inc. and George L. Taylor steered advisory clients and other investors, including senior citizens and individuals approaching retirement, into four risky, illiquid private offerings. While Temenos and Taylor charged advisory fees for unbiased financial advice, they allegedly concealed from their clients the high commissions they were pocketing from these risky and unsuitable investment recommendations, including cash and ownership stakes in the private companies they recommended, and fraudulently misled clients about the risks and prospects of the investments. The SEC also alleges that Temenos and Taylor grossly overbilled some of their advisory clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Connecticut, charges Temenos and Taylor with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.  The case is being handled by Dawn Edick, Marc Jones, Rua Kelly, Patrick Noone, and Amy Gwiazda. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Maria Viana, Kenneth Leung, and Mayeti Gametchu of the Boston office."

Greenlaw ™s offers and sales of securities in NECS and the Cannabis -Related Entities were not covered by registration statements fi led or in effect with the Commission or an applicable exemption , as required by the applicable securities laws. 3. As a result of this conduct, Defendant s have directly and indirectly violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Sect ions 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§77e(a) and (c)]. 4.

The Commissio n seeks the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77t(d)]. 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]. 7.  Venue lies in this Court pu rsuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77v(a)]. NECS ™ principal place of business and Greenlaw ™s residence are in Kittery, Maine , which is within this district. Further, Greenlaw  transacted business involving NECS  each of the Cannabis -Related Entities by offering and selling securities to the public from the district. 8. In connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint, the Defendant s have directly and indirectly made use of the means and instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell or to offer to sell the securities of NECS and the Cannabis -Related Entities . III. DEFENDANT S  9. Richard J. Green  , is an individual residing in Kittery , Maine .  Greenlaw  been the founder and managing member of NECS since 2014 and is currently its only full -time Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 3 of 9    PageID #: 3 4  employee. The Commission filed a prior enforcement action against Greenlaw in 1983 alleging violati ons of Section 5(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for his role in an investment scheme involving certain risky stocks and options trading. In November 1983,  U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire entered an order against Greenlaw in that prior case, to which he consented.  Among other things, the 1983 order included a permanent injunction against violating the above securities law statutes. 10. NECS , is a Maine limited liability company with its principal place of business in Kittery, Maine.  Greenlaw owns or controls approximately 6 0% of the shares in NECS. 11. Cannabis -Related Entities. In addition to NECS, Greenlaw formed ninet een other limited liabi lity companies (ﬁ LLCs ﬂ) for eighteen different states (including, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin ), as well as New York City.  NECS retains a t least a 51% share ownership of each of the state Cannabis -Related Entities. The additional LLC defendants are as follows: NYCS LLC, MaineCS LLC, VTCS LLC, MassCS LLC, NHCS LLC, RICS LLC, CTCS LLC, FLCS LLC, ILCS LLC, IACS LLC, LOUCS LLC, MICS LLC, MNCS LLC, NDCS LLC, NJCS LLC, OHCS LLC, PennCS LLC, UPCS LLC, and WICS LLC .  IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 12. NECS  purportedly in the business of selling medical marijuana that does not contain Tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as ﬁTHCﬂ), the chemical compound responsible for most of marijuana™s psychological effects. Instead, NECS market s Cannabidiol (or ﬁCBDﬂ), a Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 4 of 9    PageID #: 4 5  second compound present in hemp , purportedly as a therapeutic aid for various medical conditions such as pain, nausea, and anxiety , among others . 13. In late 2014, shortly after forming NECS, Greenlaw began promoting investment opportunities in NECS to prospective investors through advertiseme nts on Craigslist , an online -classified advertising website. Greenlaw described the securities offering as an opportunity to be part of the new medical cannabis industry ﬁwithout getting into marijuana and all of its regulations.ﬂ During the period December 2014 through May 4, 2018, Greenlaw posted his advertise ments in various regional pages on the Craigslist website in order to reach prospective investors in various states throughout the country . 14. Originally, Greenlaw formed LLCs f  NECS and separate entities in each of  six New England states .  Greenlaw typically offer ed prospective investors a 5% share of each LLC for $5,000 .  Greenlaw offered prospective investors quarterly profits equal to the percentage of each investor™s ownership interest ( for example, 5% of quarterly profits for 5% ownership ).  Greenlaw™s valuations of the underlying companies fluctuated, so he offered some prospective investors a 5% interest for as much as $10,000. 15. Greenlaw later expanded to additional states, forming LLCs  Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin , and two  New York, one upstate and the other for New York City. 16. In response to inquiries from prospective investors who saw the Craigslist advertisement s, Greenlaw email ed prospective investors cannabis -related literature describing CBD in further detail , as well as securities offering documents, including  documents  subscription agreements (an investment document that contains a promise by a company to sell a Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 5 of 9    PageID #: 5 6  given number of shares to an investor at a certain price and an agreement by the investor to pay that price) .  In certain instances, Greenlaw mailed the information to prospective inves tors. 17. Between December 2014 and April 2018, approximately fifty -nine investors signed subscription agreements with Greenlaw  NECS or the Cannabis -Related Entities, investing a total amount of approximately $500,000 .  Greenlaw signed the subscription agreements on behalf of NECS and/or the Cannabis -Related Entities  typically transmitted signed copies of the completed executed subscription agreements to the investors either through email or by U.S. Mail. 18. The securities transactio ns that are the subject of this complaint were not registered with the Commission. 19. Certain of the Commission™s securities registration rules allow for the sale of unregistered securities if the investors in the securities offering meet the standards for be ing an ﬁaccredited investor .ﬂ  An investor may have this status if the investor has a certain level of income or net worth. 20. Each of t  signed NECS and Cannabis -Related Entities subscription agreements have a box checked reflecting that the investors are accredited investors because they are a director, executive officer, or general partner of the LLC.  Greenlaw either pre -checked this box or asked investors to check it. However, the investors were not directors, executive officers, or general partners of the relevant LLCs .  Greenlaw understood that many of the investors would  purely passive investors and that they would not be taking any active role in managing or running of the company as a director , executive officer or general partner of the LLC .  As a result, this section of the subscription agreements did not accurately reflect all investors™ qualifications as an ﬁaccredited investor.ﬂ Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 6 of 9    PageID #: 6 7  21. Further, i n soliciting investments or otherwise offering for sale unregistered securities, Greenlaw did not otherwise take steps to determine whether the investors were in fact accredited investors.  For example, Greenlaw did not ask prospective investors for financ  information. At least some investors were not accredited investors because they did not meet the income or net worth thresholds for accredited investors . 22. No registration statement is on file with the Commission or in effect with respect to, and no exe mption applies to, the transactions alleged in paragraphs 1 through 2 1. V. CLAIM FOR RELIEF Unregistered Offer and Sale of Securities (Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act) 23. The Commission restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 22 above. 24. Defendants , by engaging in the conduct described above, directly or indirectly made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commer ce, or of the mails, to offer to sell or to sell securities, or carried or caused to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by means or instruments of transportation, securities for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale, when no r egistration statement had been filed or was in effect as to such securities, and when no exemption from registration was applicable. 25. By engaging in the conduct described above, Defendants violated, and unless restrained and enjoined, is reasonably likely t o continue to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77e(a) and (c)]. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court: Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 7 of 9    PageID #: 7 8  A.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2014, Richard J. Greenlaw, of Kittery, Maine, raised approximately $500,000 from at least 59 investors by offering securities in 20 cannabis-related entities that he formed, which purportedly sold medical marijuana products that did not contain THC, the chemical compound responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects. According to the complaint, Greenlaw sold ownership interests in the companies by posting advertisements on Craigslist. When prospective investors responded to his online ads, Greenlaw followed up with securities offering documents and sales materials describing the purported marijuana products. No registration statement was on file or in effect with the SEC with respect to this offering of securities.  The SEC's complaint charges Greenlaw and the 20 cannabis-related entities, including: NECS LLC, MaineCS LLC, VTCS LLC, MassCS LLC, NHCS LLC, RICS LLC, CTCS LLC, FLCS LLC, ILCS LLC, IACS LLC, LOUCS LLC, MICS LLC, MNCS LLC, NDCS LLC, NJCS LLC, NYCS LLC, OHCS LLC, PennCS LLC, UPCS LLC, and WICS LLC, with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Greenlaw and the cannabis-related entities consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctions from further violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 6. This case involves unlawful insider trading by Slobodan Dragojlovic in the securities of Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manages a network of ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals. 7. In December 2016, Dragojlovic misappropriated from his brother, an executive at Surgical Care, material, nonpublic information that Surgical Care was in negotiations to be acquired by UnitedHealth Group, Inc., a managed healthcare company ba sed in Minnesota. 8. In breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his brother, Dragojlovic misused this information to purchase shares of Surg ical Care stock. On January 5, 2017, Dragojlovic purchased in his personal brokerage account 2,000 shares of Surgical Care stock at an average price of $46.64 per share. 9.

At all relevant times in this Complaint, Dragojlovic™s brother was a Senior Vice President for Strategic Services at Surgical Ca re. As part of his duties at Surgical Care, Dragojlovic™s brother participated in weekly executive team conference calls. 15. In late July 2016, UnitedHealth entered into negotiations to acquire Surgical Care. Dragojlovic™s brother first learned of the negotiations on July 29, 2016, on the executive team weekly conference call. 16. In September 2016, acquisition negotiations between UnitedHealth and Surgical Care were put on hold. Negotiations resumed in December 2016 and by the end of the month, UnitedHealth had taken substantial steps towards commencement of a tender offer for Surgical Care securities. These included a meeting on December 16 between the CEOs of UnitedHealth  and Surgical Care at which they reached agreement on major terms of the proposed acquisition (including the per share acquisition price), the execution of a confidentiality agreement on December 19, and due diligence work. 17. On December 17, 2016, the CEO of Surgical Care informed the company™s executive team, including Dragojlovic™s brother, that an agreement had been reached on the  material terms of the acquisition. The CEO requested that the executive travel to Minnesota for a due diligence meeting in conn ection with the acquisition. 18. Dragojlovic™s brother traveled extensively over the next week in connection with the pending acquisition. He travelled from his home in Rancho Santa Fe, California, to Minnesota on December 18, 2016, and returned home on Decem ber 20. On December 21, he travelled to Chicago, and returned home again on December 23. 19. On December 24, 2016, Dragojlovic™s brot her hosted a family holiday party, which was an annual family custom. Dragojlovi c and other family members attended. At the Case 2:18-cv-09456   Document 1   Filed 11/07/18   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:4  1 2       9 10                  28    - 5 - COMPLAINT family holiday party on December 24, Dragojlovic™ s brother told Dragojlovic that his company, Surgical Care, was in negotiations to be acquired by UnitedHealth. He told Dragojlovic this in confidence to explain why he had been traveling that week and why he had not been able to prepare a lavish meal for the family ho liday party as he had in past years. 20. Dragojlovic knew the information his brot her told him in confidence about the potential acquisition was both material and nonpub lic. On January 5, 2017, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his brother, Dragojlovic traded on this mate rial nonpublic information. He purchased in his personal brokerage account 2,000 shares of Surgical Care stock, at an average price of $46.64 per share.     21. On the morning of January 9, 2017, UnitedHealth and Surgical Care announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement for UnitedHealth to acquire Surgical Care, pursuant to a tender offer, at a price of $57 per share. The agreed purchase price represented a premium of more than 16% over the prior market closing price of Surgical Care stock at $48.75 per share. That day, after the pub lic announcement of the acquisition, the market price of Surgical Care stock increased more than 16% on heavy tr ading and closed at a price of $56.65 per share. Dragojlovic sold his Surgical Care stock two days later. His illicit trading profits from trading in Surgical Care stock totaled $20,101.

6,"1  UNITED STATES DIST RICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, Civil Action No. 18-6854 v.    Mark Suleymanov Defendant. Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) files this Complaint against Defendant Mark Suleymanov (ﬁSuleymanovﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ),  alleges as follows: SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS 1. Between at least early 2012 and early 2016, Suleymanov engaged in  fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of binary options securities over the internet. Suleymanov , who was doing business as SpotFN and a number of other brands , raised at least $4 million from retail investors, some of whom were senior citizens without in vestment experience. As a result of the  scheme, i nvestors suffered losses , including losses of retirement funds , which SpotFN encouraged investors to use. 2. Suleymanov operated a SpotFN website and other related websites, which misrepresented the profitability of investing in binary options using SpotFN™s platform, as well as investors™ ability to access their funds. In reality, Suleymanov used software to manipulate investors™ trading results to increase investor losses . In addition, Suleymanov caused man y investors to be unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds .    Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 1 of 12 PageID #: 1 2  3.  The SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor™s funds would be held in a segregated account and used only f or trading options, not for SpotFN™s b usiness expenses . In fact, investors™ funds were co mmingled in bank accounts controlled by Suleymanov, who misused certain investor funds for both business and personal expenses .  4. By engaging in the conduct describe d in this Complaint, Suleymanov violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17  of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] , Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b -5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b -5] thereunder , and the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c)] and unless re strained and enjoined will again engage in violations of these p rovisions. 5. The Commission seeks an order enjoining Suleymanov from further violations, requiring Suleymanov to disgorge his ill -gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing monetary penalties. JURSIDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)]  Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § § 78u and 78aa]. 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Sec urities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v]  Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa] . 8. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, used the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business  described in this Complaint. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 2 3  9. Venue is appropriate in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exc hange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the offers and sales of securities, and acts and transactions constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint , occurred in th e Eastern District of New York , and Suleymanov resides and transacts business in the District .  DEFENDANT 10. Mark Suleymanov , age 38, is a resident of Glen Cove, New York. Suleymanov  business as SpotFN , an unincorporated entity offering and selling binary options over the internet . Suleymanov established  SpotFN.com website , as well as related websites such as BinaryAcademics.com, AssetSignals.com, BinaryFN.com, and OptionsMogul.com, among others. He opened and controlled bank accounts to which investors sent their money.  Suleymanov also controlled the risk settings on software that cause d investors to lose money they had invested in SpotFN binary options .    FACTS Suleymanov Created a SpotFN Website , and Related Websites, to Sell Binary Options Securities 11. Between at least early 2012  early 2016, Suleymanov offered and sold binary options securities to customers throughout the United States through a number of different public websites, including SpotFN.com , BinaryFN.com, and OptionsMogul.com, among others (collectively, ﬁSpotFNﬂ). E ach of these web domains was registered to and controlled by Suleymanov. The SpotFN web domains included BinaryAcademics.com , which purported to sell educational materials that would supposedly improve an investor ™s performance, and AssetSignals.com, which purported to sell trading ﬁsignals,ﬂ or tips on market movements , that would also supposedly improve investors™ trading results. Via these ﬁeducationalﬂ sites, Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 3 4  Suleymanov encouraged investors to make more trades on the SpotFN platform, which resulted in investors incurring more losses. 12. The SpotFN binary options were options contracts o f short duration that  e based on the price of stocks and stock indexes, or other financial assets . A binary option™s payout depended on the outcome of a ﬁyes/noﬂ proposition. For example, SpotFN offered and sold  binary options in which a n investor would choose whether a given stock™ s price would be above or below a specified price at a specified time. When the option expired, the investor would either earn a pre -determined amount if he chose correctly, or he would earn nothing and forfeit  amount of his investment if he chose incorrectly . Binary options are securities within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act when they take the form of options based on the  value of a security or index of securities. 13. Investor funds were sent, either by wire or via credit card processors, into bank accounts that had been opened and were controlled by Suleymanov. Suleymanov received approximately $4 million in investor funds through these accounts .  14. Suleymanov caused SpotFN™s website to falsely represent that SpotFN was a legitimate incorporated entity with officers and directors, when in fact, for most of its existence, it was not.  Suleymanov also caused SpotFN™s website to misleadingly feature the NASDAQ logo, despite  the fa ct that SpotFN™s binary options were not traded on NASDAQ or any other regulated  exchange. Unregistered Offers and Sales of SpotFN Binary Options 15. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e], it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectl y, to offer or sell securities using the U.S. mails or interstate commerce, unless (1) the offer or sale is registered with the SEC pursuant to a valid registration statement Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4 5  that applies to that specific offering; or (2) the offer or sale is specifically exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5. 16. No registration statement was filed or in effect as to the offer and sale of binary options through the SpotFN websites. In addition, no exemption from the registration requirement applied. Suleymanov directly sold the securities via SpotFN, creating and maintaining the  websites through which the securities were offered and sold . Suleymanov Made Material Misrepresentations  Engaged in a Fraudulent Scheme A. Suleymanov Misrepresented that Binary Options Trading Would Be Profitable 17. On the SpotFN websites, Suleymanov made false statements about the significant and sustainable profits that investors could expect from trading binary options using SpotFN™s  platform , and about SpotFN™s motivation to have clients™ trading be successful . For example, the SpotFN.com website stated :   ﬁUp to 88% Return.ﬂ ﬁ[Clients] will be able to have their investment account become a self -sufficient, lifelong source of funds accessible when needed at any time.ﬂ ﬁThe final result is to have clients be able to withdraw on a consistent basis, without affecting their ever -growing account balance.ﬂ ﬁAt SpotFN, we want our clients to be able to attain a constant source of income.ﬂ ﬁWe are l ooking to create longstanding sustainability for our clients that will be shown by the growth of their portfolios.ﬂ ﬁWe are highly motivated to make our clients as successful as possible in tradin  for the very reason that your success is our success.ﬂ 18. These statements were materially false and misleading because Suleymanov in fact caused losses for investors. In contrast to the ﬁup to 88% returnﬂ that the site touted, many investors ultimately lost all, or nearly all, of their invested capital. One inve stor ™s account experienced an ultimate win rate of only 38%, resulting in the loss of his entire account balance. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 5 6  Other investors experienced similarly dismal results, with the same ultimate outcome: depleted accounts, no matter how much they invested. B. Suleymanov Engaged in Deceptive Conduct to Cause Losses for Investors 19. As part of a scheme, Suleymanov engaged in deceptive conduct to cause losses for investors. One way that he achieved this was through t  SpotFN trading model . The trading model worked in the following way: when investors placed a losing trade, they forfeited 100% of the amount of that trade. When they placed a winning trade, they typically received 70 -80% of the amount of the trade. Because the amount of a loss was larger than the amount of a gain, on average, assuming a 50% win rate, an account would cumulatively lose value the more it was  traded. 20. In addition, Suleymanov used a restrictive withdrawal policy to encourage SpotFN customers to place a large volume of trades which would lead to more losses. Although   website stated that the client™s success meant SpotFN™s success, the truth was just the opposite. The funds that the customers lost, SpotFN gained. 21. Suleymanov also acted behind the scenes and used software to manipulate t he rates at which customers won or lost trades. Suleymanov admitted in a February 2016 email to the  company that sold him the software that he used it to give new customers high rates of winning  trades initially to encourage them to invest more funds, then he adjusted the setting so the  investors would experience losses. Suleymanov stated: ﬁWe use that as a marketing tool to lure customers in for the first time, get them to deposit as much as possible, let them win– then once all their funds and wires come  we then turn that feature into a positive for the platform. –We are controlling the  situation with them. The wins are their way of bringing in the funds to the company. We discussed this– that clients will be given bonuses in the beginning to see how easy they can win. But again, once the funds are in, that setting gets adjusted to a loss for them.  This is not our first day at the park with this.ﬂ Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 6 7  C. Suleymanov Falsely Promised Inves tors Easy Access to Their Funds 22. Suleymanov caused the SpotFN website s to promise investors ﬁhassle free withdrawalsﬂ that were ﬁfast and secure.ﬂ One of SpotFN™s selling points was that investments would generate profits that would be ﬁaccessible when needed anytime.ﬂ In reality, however, Suleymanov  caused many investors to be unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds. 23. Suleymanov™s primary technique for retaining investors™ money was SpotFN™s so -called bonus policy. When investors opened accounts, SpotFN frequently credited them with ﬁaccount bonuses,ﬂ credits which increased an investor™s trading account balance beyond what he   personally funded. In some cases, investors recalled being offered these bonuses as an inducement to fund a certain amount in to their accounts, but in other cases, investors simply  discovered that the amounts had been added without their consent. Investors were not warned that the bonus money came with cons equences: that every bonus dollar in an account had to be traded thirty t imes before SpotFN would approve any withdrawal request from that account. When an investor placed a withdrawal request for funds from his account, SpotFN would often  cancel the request, citing this policy. 24. Some investors increase d the volume of trading in their accounts, in order to be eligible for cash withdrawals. However, increased trading volume meant that the investors™ account balances depleted quickly as a result of trading losses. 25. Some investors received other e xcuses as to why their requested wit hdrawals never arrived . These excuses ran the gamut from supposed bank errors, to computer failures, to frozen accounting software, to accidental misrouting to the wrong account. A few investors did receiv e some amount of withdrawal or refund , after the investor threatened to pursue a fraud claim or  charge -back against SpotFN with their bank or credit card company. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 7 8  26. The SpotFN websites are no longer operational. Once the websites were removed from the internet in early 2016, investors found that their telephone calls and emails to SpotFN were no longer answered. Since investors™ only access to their accounts had been through the SpotFN websites, all ability for investors to access or view their account balances, trade or transa ction  history, or any other data, vanished along with the site. There was no advance warning that  SpotFN would be going out of business , and no procedure for investors to get refunds of the balances in their accounts. D. Suleymanov Misrepresented That Invest ors™ Funds Were Held in Segregated Accounts and Used Only for Trading Binary Options 27. Suleymanov caused t he SpotFN website to state that: ﬁUpon receipt of your deposit(s), SpotFN will place your trading capital into one or more segregated client account(s).ﬂ The website stated that the funds could not be used in the course of SpotFN™s business, adding,  ﬁFunds are used only for trading options through our website upon client™s inst ructions and are never used for any other cause.ﬂ The website also stated, ﬁSpotFN™s Compliance Department ensures that your deposited funds and trading profits are secure,ﬂ adding that ﬁthe Compliance department specializes in combating fraud and money la undering, ensuring that your funds are always protected.ﬂ 28. Contrary to these representations, SpotFN did not have a Compliance Department, and investors™ funds were not placed into segregated accounts. When investors transferred money  SpotFN to fund their SpotF N trading accounts, their  ey was actually commingled in several bank accounts that were opened and controlled by Suleymanov. This was material because  investors™ funds were not used as represented ; the funds were not secure or protec ted as promised; and Suleymanov had access to investors™ fu nds to use for his own purposes, which  was not disclosed to the investors. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8 9  E. Suleymanov Misused Investor Funds 29. Suleymanov misused certain investor funds . Instead of ensuring that investors™ funds were used only for the trading of options as the SpotFN website had claimed , Suleymanov used some of these funds to pay business expenses, such as the payment of salary and other compensation to employees, as wel l as personal expenses, such as payments on his personal mortgage.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from at least 2012 to 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of binary options, which are securities that pay out depending on the outcome of a ""yes/no"" proposition, such as whether a specific equity security will close at or above a specified price on a given trading day. Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds. Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds. As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses. In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses.  The SEC's complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty. Suleymanov has agreed to a bifurcated settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from these provisions. The settlement, which is subject to Court approval, reserves the issues of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Shioji and supervised by Lisa Deitch, Cheryl Crumpton, and Antonia Chion. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office.

Case No. ______________  COMPLAINT   Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges: SUMMARY 1. This case involves insider trading in the securities of Qualys, Inc. (ﬁQualysﬂ) by Defendant Amer Deeba.  During the first week of April 2015, Deeba, then a senior executive officer at Qualys, learned that the company had missed its in ternal sales forecast for the first quarter of the fiscal year (ﬁQ1 2015ﬂ).  On April 8, Deeba shared this material nonpublic information with his two brothers, who were Qualys shareholders.  That same day, Deeba contacted his brothers™ broker and helped arrange for the broker to sell all of his brothers™ Qualys shares. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 1 of 7  COMPLAINT 2 CASE NO. ___________ 1 2 3      9 10                  28 2. After the market closed on May 4, 2015, Qualys announced disappointing Q1 2015 financial results.  Qualys revealed that it had missed its Q1 2015 revenue guidance, that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downwar d, and that the growth rate of its largest business segment had declined.  The next day Qualys ™s stock price fell 25%.  As a result of Deeba tipping his brothers with material nonpublic information, both brothers so ld all of their Qualys shares ahead of the announcement and avoided losses of $456,636 and $124,534, respectively.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 3. The Commission brings this action pursua nt to Sections 21(d) and 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u-1. 4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21A, and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u-1 and 78aa. 5. Defendant Deeba, directly or indirectly, ma de use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and of the mails, and of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions , acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein.   6. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, because a substantial part of the acts and transactions constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred within the Northern Dist rict of California, and because Defendant Deeba resides or transacts business in the district. INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT 7. Under Civil Local Rule 3-2(d), this civil action should be assigned to the San Francisco Division, because a substan tial part of the events which give rise to the claims alleged herein occurred in San Mateo County, and Defendant Deeba resides in San Francisco County. DEFENDANT 8. Amer Deeba is a 51-year-old U.S. citizen re siding in San Francisco, California.  He joined Qualys in 2001.  He was Qualys™s Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategic Alliances from 2014 until 2016, when he was promoted to Chief Commercial Officer.  He resigned from the company on August 2, 2018.  At all releva nt times, Deeba was a senior executive and a Section 16 officer at Qualys.

Qualys, Inc. is a provider of cloud security, compliance, and related services incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Redwood City, California.  At all relevant times, Qualys™s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁ Exchange Actﬂ) and was quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker QLYS. 10. Brother 1 is an engineer residing in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.  He is Deeba™s older brother and a citizen of Lebanon.   11. Brother 2 is a doctor residing in Beirut, Lebanon.  He is Deeba™s younger brother and a citizen of Lebanon. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Background 12. Deeba worked at Qualys from 2001 to 2018 and was an important member of the company™s leadership team.  Hi s responsibilities included running Qualys™s marketing division, overseeing Qualys™s alliances with its distributor s, vetting potential acquisitions, negotiating deals with prominent customers, and assisting with the preparation of the company™s quarterly earnings releases.  During the time period relevant to th is action, Deeba was the only senior executive at Qualys with a workstation near Qualys™s CE O, and the two executives spoke frequently. 13. Deeba is close with his two brothers, and he speaks with them often.  Brother 1 provided significant financial assistance to Deeba during college and gr aduate school.  Deeba in turn provided significant financial assistance to Brother 2 during and after medical school. 14. In 2005, Deeba gifted his brothers Qualys stock.  After Qualys went public in 2012, Deeba arranged for a brokerage firm (the ﬁBrokerage Firmﬂ) to open accounts for each of his brothers to hold their Qualys shares.  The only securities that the brothers™ accounts ever held were the Qualys shares that Deeba had gifted to them in 2005.   Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 3 of 7  COMPLAINT 4 CASE NO. ___________ 1 2 3      9 10                  28 B. Qualys™s Insider Trading Policy 15. In 2012, Deeba received a copy of Qualys™s insider trading policy.  Deeba was aware that he had a duty not to trade Qualys shares on material nonpublic in formation gained in the course of his employment or share such information with others outside the company who might trade. 16. Qualys™s insider trading policy specifically warned employees that ﬁdisclosing material nonpublic information dire ctly or indirectly to others who then trade based on that information or making recommendations or expressing opinions as to transactions in securities while aware of material nonpublic informati on (which is sometimes referred to as ‚tipping™) is . . . illegal.ﬂ C. Deeba Tips His Brothers, Who Sell All Their Qualys Stock 17. In early February 2015, Qualys forecasted internally that Q1 2015 sales would be $42.6 millionŠrepresenting 28% year-over-year growth. 18. On February 9, 2015, Qualys publicly announced that it expected Q1 2015 revenue to be between $37.6 million and $38.1 million and that it expected full-year 2015 revenue to be between $167.3 million and $169.3 million.  Qualys derived thes e public revenue guidance numbers, in substantial part, from the nonpublic sales forecast it had prepared.  At all relevant times, Qualys treated its sales figures as nonpublic, confidential information. 19. Qualys™s internal sales results were ma terial information.  Qualys employees considered the internal sales forecast and internal sales data to be an important metric for the company and often viewed it as a barometer of the business.  For example, Qualys™s former Chief Financial Officer described the company™s sales figur es as the company™s ﬁprincipal determinant of revenue.ﬂ  Qualys™s former Vice President of Fina nce described them as a ﬁleading indicatorﬂ of the health of Qualys™s business. 20. Qualys™s CEO had a practice of sharing quarter-end sales results with Deeba before Qualys announced its results to the market.  For ex ample, after three of th e four quarters in 2014, the CEO emailed the quarter-end sales results to Deeba within three days of th e end of the quarter.  21. Qualys™s Q1 2015 ended on March 31.  On April 2, Qualys™s Vice President of Finance sent an email to Qualys™s CEO showi ng that the company had achieved Q1 2015 sales Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 7  COMPLAINT 5 CASE NO. ___________ 1 2 3      9 10                  28 growth of 23.6%, representing about $41 million in sales. This was lower than the internal forecast of $42.6 million, which would have equated to 28% growth. 22. Late in the day on April 7, Deeba spoke with Qualys™s CEO by telephone for twenty minutes.  At the time, Deeba was in Lebanon visiting his family.  Deeba learned of Qualys™s Q1 2015 sales miss during this call. 23. The next day, on April 8, Deeba tipped his brothers about the sales miss.  That morning, he called Brother 1, and the two spoke by telephone for 11 minutes.  D eeba also sent a text message to Brother 2, asking him to give Deeba a call. 24. Later on April 8, just four minutes afte r the U.S. stock markets opened, Deeba contacted his financial advisor at the Brokerage Firm and told him that he wanted to coordinate trades for his brothers.  Deeba then called Brother 2. 25. A few minutes later, Deeba had a nine-and- a-half-minute telephone call with a broker in the Brokerage Firm™s international group, whic h was responsible for maintaining Brother 1 and Brother 2™s brokerage accounts.  Immediately after that call ended, the broker with whom Deeba had been speaking placed orders to sell all of Brothe r 1 and Brother 2™s Qualys stock.  Brother 1 sold 42,164 shares of Qualys stock, and Brother 2 sold 11,499 shares of Qualys stock.  According to the broker, Brother 1 and Brother 2 each instructed the broker to sell their respective shares. D. Qualys Reveals Its Q1 2015 Financial Results 26. On May 4, 2015, after the U.S. markets had cl osed, Qualys publicly announced its Q1 2015 financial results.  The company revealed th at it had missed the low end of its previously- announced Q1 2015 revenue guidance range by $100,000.  At the same time, the company announced that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward, from $167.3 million - $169.3 million to $165 million - $166.5 million.  Qualys al so disclosed that the growth rate for its largest business segment had declin ed.  That same day, after the earnings announcement, Deeba sent a text message to Brother 2, stating, ﬁWe announ ced the bad news today.ﬂ  The following day, Qualys™s stock price dropped 25%. 27. By selling their stock on April 8, Brother 1 and Brother 2 avoided losses of $456,636 and $124,534, respectively, totaling $581,170 in losses avoided.

Deeba, in breach of the duty he owed to Qualys and its shareholders, tipped material, nonpublic information concerning Qualys™s Q1 2015 sales to Brother 1 and Brother 2.  Deeba knew that Brother 1 and Brother 2 would sell Qualys stock on the basis of this information. 32. Deeba benefitted from the tip because the tw o persons he tipped were close relatives who traded on the tip. 33.

According to the SEC's complaint, Amer Deeba gifted his two brothers Qualys shares in 2005. The SEC alleges that on April 7, 2015, Deeba learned that Qualys had missed its internal Q1 2015 sales forecast, which served as a basis for the revenue guidance the company provided to the market. According to the SEC, the next day, Deeba informed his two brothers about the miss and contacted his brothers' brokerage firm to coordinate the sale of all of his brothers' Qualys stock. When Qualys publicly announced its financial results, it reported that it had missed its previously-announced first-quarter revenue guidance and that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward.  On the same day, Deeba sent a message to one of his brothers saying, ""We announced the bad news today."" The next day, Qualys's stock price dropped 25%. Although Deeba made no profits from his conduct, Deeba's brothers collectively avoided losses of $581,170 by selling their Qualys stock.  After seventeen years at Qualys, Deeba resigned his position as a senior leader and officer of Qualys on August 2, 2018. Under the terms of his settlement, which is subject to court approval, he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-reporting company for two years and he will pay a $581,170 penalty.  To settle the SEC's charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, Deeba has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

SUMMARY 1. This case involves insider trading  Carr , a New Hampshire resident,  Hanratty , a Connecticut resident, in the sha res of Heartland Payment Systems , Inc. (ﬁHeartlandﬂ) , a New Jersey -based compa ny, ahead of  December 15, 2016 announcement that it was to be acquired by Georgia -based Global Payments, Inc . (ﬁGlobalﬂ) .  Carr, then the Chief Executive Officer (ﬁCEOﬂ) of Heartland, tipped Hanratty, his romantic partner, to material, nonpublic inform ation that was expected to Œ and did Œ dramatically increase the value of Heartland™s stock.  Specifically, Carr tipped Hanratty concerning the acquisition of Heartland by Global, and Hanratty purchased Heartland stock while in possession of , and on the ba sis of , that material, nonpublic information provided by Carr. 2. Carr , as the CEO of Heartland, was intimately involved in the negotiations from October to December 2015 that led to his company™s acquisition by Global. Carr shared material, nonpublic inform ation about the potential acquisition of Heartland by Global with Hanratty at various times during this period .  For example, on or before November 9, 2015, Carr Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 1 of 13 2  revealed to Hanratty that he would be meeting with the CEO of Global on November 9, 2015 , to discuss the potential acquisition of Heartland by Global.  That same day, after Carr™s meeting with the Global CEO had concluded, Carr sent an email to Hanratty and told her on that Global had offered to acquire Heartland for a premium per share of Heartlan d™s stock, and told Hanratty that the acquisition of Heart land would be completed by mid -December 2015.  Thereafter, o n November 15, 2016, Carr provided Hanratty a check for $1 million and instructed her to use that money to open a brokerage account and pu rchase $900,000 worth of Heartland stock.  Hanratty acquired the Heartland securities as instructed by Carr , completing the purchases of Heartland stock weeks prior to the news of the acquisition of Heartland by Global became public in December 2015.  acquisition of Heartland by Global caused Heartland™s stock price to significantly increase, and Hanratty eventually sold the stock for a profit of over $250,000. 3.

Hanratty then emailed Carr that she would sell all of her Heartland stock that day. 39. The next day, Hanratty emailed Carr again , stating that she sold her stock according to Carr™s instructions.  Hanratty sold her 11,393 shares of Heartland at $101.066  share , for a profit of $250,628 when compared to the prices at which she bought the stock in November 2015 .   C.

According to the SEC's complaint, Robert O. Carr provided his longtime girlfriend, Katherine M. Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. by another payment processing company. In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock. The SEC alleges that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock. After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock. Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges Carr and Hanratty with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The SEC's complaint further seeks to bar Carr from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-reporting company.  The SEC's case is being handled by Xinyue Angela Lin, Deena Bernstein, and Paul G. Block of the Boston Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (ORSA), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."

Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon, with and through their company, SeeThruEquity,LLC (""STE""), defrauded investors and prospective investors by purporting to provide unbiasedresearch reports on certain publicly-traded small and microcap companies. Defendantsrepresented that STE's reports were ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for,"" that the price targets includedin them were objectively determined, that Defendants did not own the stocks being covered, andthat Defendants took precautions to maintain STE's objectivity. Contrary to those claims,Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 1 of 25 Defendants were compensated handsomely by the covered companies for the research reportsthey published. In addition, Defendants inflated price targets for the companies for which theypublished research reports and made other false statements and omissions, repeatedly violatingboth the anti-fraud and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.2. In addition, Ajay Tandon violated the anti-fraud provisions by investing in STE-covered companies and selling his holdings in the immediate aftermath of favorable STEresearch reports, reaping profits from that illegal pattern of trading.JURISDICTION AND VENUE3.

He is an attorney and a member of the New YorkBar.FACTSBackground of SeeThruEquity, LLC9. Unless another time is specified, each of the allegations in this Complaint refers tothe period November 9, 2013 to present.10. STE purports to be an equity research company focused on smaller emerginggrowth companies.11. Headquartered in New York City (Manhattan) at all times described herein, STEpublishes research reports on the companies that it covers.3Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 3 of 25 12. STE posts those research reports (including all reports referred to herein) on itswebsite (www.seethruequity.com), distributes them to an opt-in email distribution list estimatedto include 20,000 investors, transmits them for further distribution to aggregators of equityresearch reports such as Thomson First Call, makes them available via links to its website onother social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, and, often, announces and links tothem through press releases.13. Brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon co-founded STE in 2011.14. Amit Tandon filed the formation documents for STE, creating the company as aDelaware single member limited liability company.15. Ajay Tandon is the sole member of STE and its Chief Executive Officer.16. Amit Tandon is STE's Director of Research.17. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon had log-in credentials for STE's website andsocial media accounts.18. Ajay Tandon and, from approximately early 2016, Amit Tandon, had signatoryauthority over STE's primary bank account.19. Both Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon drew regular salaries from STE.Research Reports on Companies in STE's Coverage Universe20. Defendants refer to the collection of companies for which STE has issuedresearch reports as STE's ""coverage universe.""21. As of the date of this complaint, STE's coverage universe consists of at least 240companies.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 4 of 25 22. An STE ""initiation report"" is STE's first research report on a company. Suchreports typically are 15 to 20 pages long.23. An STE '`update report'"" is a research report on a company for which STE haspreviously published an initiation report. Such reports typically are three to five pages long.24. Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon divided roughly evenly the responsibilities ofSTE's research business, including responsibility for overseeing the completion of STE researchreports.25. In general, the Tandon brother responsible for any specific report is listed as a""contact person"" in the specific report.26. The report preparation process began with Ainit Tandon or Ajay Tandon giving toan analyst, retained as an STE contractor, an assignment to prepare a research report.27. STE compensated its contract analysts on a per report basis, typically at a rate of$1,000 per report.28. Having received an assignment, STE's contract analysts input relevant financialdata into a spreadsheet quantitative model (""the STE Model"" or ""Model"")) designed to perform aquantitative analysis and produce certain outputs, including a purportedly objective ""price target""for the company's stock.29. Each STE research report listed the price target next to a recent historical price ofthe stock.30. For example, the October 5, 2017 STE initiation report published on issuerCemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), includes the following:Price Target: $6.45Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 5 of 25 Recent Share Price: $2.8431. Investors and prospective investors who read that report therefore wouldreasonably conclude that STE's purportedly objective analysis revealed a potential for priceappreciation in CETX stock of more than double the current trading price.32. Every single purportedly objective price target that STE has ever published hasbeen higher than the stock in question's then-current trading price.33. STE's contract analysts used the product of the STE Model to prepare a draft ofthe research report, which they then forwarded either to Amit Tandon or Ajay Tandon,depending on which of the Tandons had given them the assignment.34. Working from the draft, Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon finalized, published, anddistributed the research reports.35. As more fully set forth below, in connection with the creation and publication ofSTE research reports and related communications, Defendants made misrepresentations andomissions relating to, among other things: (1) the supposed ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" natureof STE's research, (2) Ajay Tandon's ownership of stocks in the STE coverage universe, (3) theobjectivity of STE's published price targets, (4) the existence of ""customary internal tradingrestrictions,"" and (5) the scalping of STE covered-stocks.Misrepresentations and Omissions RegardingSupposedly ""Unbiased"" and ""Not Paid For"" Research36. All of the research reports issued by Defendants from November 9, 2013 throughat least March 30, 2018, made the representation, or some variation thereof, that ""SeeThruEquityCase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 6 of 25 has not been compensated for the preparation of this report by any third party or the companycovered in the report.""37. STE also represented on its website, on which it posted all STE research reports,and in press releases that often accompanied newly issued STE research reports, that its researchwas ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for.""38. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon knew when they finalized and issued thereports for which they were responsible that these representations in STE's reports and pressreleases and on STE's website were false and that STE had, in fact, been compensated for eachreport to the tune of several thousand dollars in each instance.39. In addition, Ajay Tandon, as STE's CEO and the person with ultimate authorityover the content of STE's research reports, provided substantial assistance to STE by approvingfor publication STE's reports, all of which omitted any disclosure regarding the compensationreceived for those reports.40. To obscure the compensation they received for preparing and disseminatingresearch reports, Defendants ostensibly invited companies to make a ""presentation"" at aninvestor conference in return for STE providing a ""free"" research report for that company.41. Defendants charged between $4,000 and $7,000 for the company to make apresentation at an STE conference. Defendants then claimed that the STE equity research reportthat STE published thereafter was provided at no charge.42. Defendants held out the research reports as ""not paid for,"" although they receivedthousands of dollars for issuing each research report.7Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 7 of 25 43. On at least one occasion, Ajay Tandon directed a STE research analyst to put aresearch report on hold because a company had ""not paid for the conference.""44. Approximately 233 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 97%, paid STE ostensible conference presentation fees, andfour other companies paid STE for supposed ""distribution"" or ""press release"" services relating toSTE's research. Put another way, 237 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 98%, paid STE.45. STE received at least $500,000 from companies in its coverage universe, fromJanuary 1, 2014 to the present.46. In at least one instance, Defendants did not even bother to hide behind theirconference model.47. Specifically, in September 2017, Cemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) explicitlyagreed to pay STE $14,500, in exchange for STE providing Cemtrex 18 months of researchcoverage, including one initiation report and five quarterly update reports, with press releases toaccompany each report.48. Defendant Ajay Tandon negotiated this arrangement with CETX49. Yet the press release announcing the publication of the CETX initiation reportincluded the following:SeeThruEquity has pioneered an innovative business model forequity research that is not paid for and is unbiased. (emphasisadded).50. None of the Defendants' research reports for CETX disclosed this compensation.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 8 of 25 51. Beginning in or about August 2016, STE began stating in its ""Disclosures"" that it""may"" receive compensation from the companies featured in its report for ""non-report-relatedservices,"" including presenting at STE conferences. At no time, however, did any of theDefendants tell investors and prospective investors that STE was in fact receiving compensationfrom the covered companies.Defendants' Research Reports for Quadrant 4 Systems Corp.Misrepresent Compensation and Ownership of a Covered Stock52. In connection with its coverage of Quadrant 4 Systems Corp. (OTCMKTS:QFOR), Defendants concocted an elaborate scheme to conceal STE's receipt of compensationfrom that issuer and ownership of the issuer's shares, structuring the payment of QFOR sharesthrough athird-party nominee.53. Ajay Tandon was primarily responsible for the QFOR initiation report (issued inDecember 2012), and update report (issued in December 2013).54. Approximately one month prior to the publication of the initiation report, QFORissued a QFOR stock certificate for 10,000 shares of restricted stock to a Rajinder Bither(""Bither"").55. Bither is Ajay and Amit Tandon's uncle.56. Bither has never lived in the United States. He lives in India.57. Rather than mail the stock certificate to Bither in India, however, Ajay Tandondirected the issuer (or its transfer agent) to mail the stock certificate to STE's Manhattan office.58. Bither has never done any work for QFOR or STE, but the 10,000 shares ofQFOR issued to Bither were allegedly compensation for consulting work he did for QFOR.ECase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 9 of 25 59. The only evidence of that consulting work is a ""consulting agreement"" purportingto be between Bither and QFOR.60. As originally drafted, the consulting agreement was between QFOR and STE, notBither.61. There are handwritten edits on the consulting agreement by which someonecrossed out STE's name and inserted Bither's.62. The consulting agreement was edited to hide the fact that Ajay Tandon owned10,000 shares of QFOR, received as payment for a favorable STE research report.63. In December 2012, STE published its initiation report on QFOR.64. STE's price target for QFOR in the initiation report was $.59, more than fourtimes the then-current trading price of $.14.65. The December 2012 QFOR initiation report falsely claimed that neither STE norits principals owned shares of QFOR.66. In December 2013, STE published its QFOR update report.67. That December 2013 report falsely claimed that neither STE nor its principalsowned shares of QFOR.68. Ajay Tandon and STE still had the 10,000 certificated shares (issued to Bither) intheir possession on the day the update report was published in December 2013.69. Ajay Tandon considered those shares his, and he knew that the insertion of Bitherinto the scenario was designed to hide his ownership of these shares.70. In fact, on December 4, 2013, five days prior to the publication of the updatereport, Ajay Tandon wrote a letter to the QFOR transfer agent requesting the removal of the10Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 10 of 25 restrictive legend from the 10,000 shares and further asking that the shares be reissued,unrestricted, in his (Ajay Tandon's) name.71. An unrestricted QFOR share certificate was in fact issued in Ajay Tandon's nameon December 9, 2013, the same day that STE published the QFOR update report.72. By using his uncle's name on the QFOR consulting agreement and as the initialpurported holder of QFOR stock, Ajay Tandon hid the fact that STE was not the ""unbiased""equity research company that the Tandons represented it to be.73. Moreover, QFOR is not the only stock about which Ajay Tandon hasmisrepresented share ownership.74. In 2014 and 2015, Ajay Tandon gave multiple interviews to an online publicationcalled the Life Sciences Report.75. In each of his interviews he affirmatively disclaimed both stock ownership andany financial interest in the issuers discussed.76. However, at the time he was interviewed, Ajay Tandon owned stock in at leasttwo of the issuers discussed during the interviews, and nearly all of the issuers discussed hadpaid to present at STE conferences.Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Objectivity of STE Price Targets77. As mentioned above (paragraphs 26 through 34), Defendants contracted withanalysts to perform purportedly objective quantitative modeling in order to project future pricesof equity securities of STE-covered issuers.78. The Defendants used the STE Model from the inception of STE in 2011 topresent.11Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 11 of 25 79. The STE Model required an STE analyst to input certain data about the issuer, atwhich point the Model would produce a figure called a ""price target,"" representing the Model'sprojection of what a share of the issuer's stock would be worth in the future.80. STE often issued press releases in conjunction with publication of its researchreports and often highlighted the ""price target"" in such releases.81. Although the STE Model through which STE performed analysis of issuersyielded a supposedly objective price target, 100% of STE's published price targets were inexcess of the then-current trading price.82. Moreover, STE often published a different, higher, price target, going well abovethe Model's initial results.83. Having paid STE thousands of dollars, issuers expected to, and often did, receiveinput into the substance of STE's supposedly unbiased research reports, including the pricetarget.84. Again, for all 233 companies in STE's coverage universe as of March 31, 2018 onwhich STE had issued a price target, every single price target was higher than the subject stock'scurrent trading price.85. Moreover, the average STE price target was more than 300% higher than thecurrent trading price.86. Both Ajay and Amit Tandon periodically instructed STE analysts to increase theprice targets generated by the STE Model.87. On the instruction of the Tandons, STE analysts increased the price targets abovethe targets generated by the STE Model.12Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 12 of 25 88. On occasion, the Tandons instructed their analysts to make the price target acertain specific figure, or within a specific range, even before the financial modeling had beencompleted.89. By way of specific example for a report created by Amit Tandon, in March 2017,in connection with the preparation of a research report on a company with the ticker symbolFTNW, Amit Tandon instructed the analyst preparing the draft (""Analyst 1 ""), ""Let's try and do$2.75 on the PT.""90. Analyst 1 complied, and Amit Tandon approved the report for release on March21, 2017, with a price target of $2.75.91. The FTNW report does not disclose that Amit Tandon dictated the price target forFTNW.92. On other occasions the Tandons directed STE analysts to increase the price targetsafter issuers Šwho were provided an initial draft of the report before publication Šcomplainedthat the price target should be higher.93. The Defendants failed to disclose in STE reports that price targets were increasedin order to better satisfy the issuers.94. Such information would have been important to a reasonable investor.95. The above-mentioned QFOR update report issued in December 2013 (seeparagraphs 52 through 73) provides another example of undisclosed influence (this time of AjayTandon) on STE's supposedly unbiased price targets.96. In December 2013, QFOR was trading at $1.14.13Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 13 of 25 97. In or about November 2013, an STE analyst (""Analyst 2"") was assigned toprepare a draft of the QFOR update report.98. Analyst 2 input the relevant data into the STE quantitative model, at which pointthe model produced a price target of $1.78, 56 percent above the then-current price ($1.14).99. On December 6, 2013, Analyst 2 sent Ajay Tandon the draft QFOR update reportshowing the price target of $1.78.100. On the morning of December 9, the date of publication, Ajay Tandon respondedto Analyst 2, stating, ""let's push it north of $2,"" referring to the price target.101. Analyst 2 responded, ""I can make it any #, but I had to stretch it very much just toget to these #s.""102. Ajay Tandon responded that he nevertheless wanted to push the price target""above $2, because it is a stock `hurdle' if you get my meaning.""103. Analyst 2 responded, ""[u]nderstood, just wanted to let you know this one is a realstretch,"" and Ajay Tandon stated, ""[fair enough."" Analyst 2 then adjusted the price target to$2.26 in a 10:47 AM draft of the report.104. Around noon on December 9, Ajay Tandon sent the draft update report, with the$2.26 price target, to QFOR's CEO.105. QFOR's CEO expressed displeasure with the price target.106. In reaction to that displeasure, Ajay Tandon instructed Analyst 2 to raise the pricetarget further.14Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 14 of 25 107. By 3:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised STE'sprice target to $3.16, at which point Ajay Tandon told Analyst 2 that he still wanted it raised""considerably.""108. By 4:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised theprice target to $5.25Šmore than double the ""real stretch"" price target of earlier in the day.109. Thereafter, also on December 9, 2013, Ajay Tandon finalized and publishedSTE's update report on QFOR by, among other things, posting it on the STE website,distributing it to the STE opt-in email distribution list, transmitting it to Thomson First Call, FactSet, and Capital IQ, and issuing a press release.110. That press release said, among other things:SeeThruEquity, LLC, a New York City based firm focused onproviding unbiased and institutional equity research ... issued acompany update report on ... QFOR.SeeThruEquity is an approved equity research contributor onThomson One Analytics (First Call).[STE] research is unbiased and not paid for research.111. In truth, the research report was both paid for and biased.112. No investor reading the report or the press release could know that the price targetreflected in the published QFOR report was nearly 300 percent higher than the price targetproduced by STE's supposedly objective quantitative analysis, nor that Ajay Tandon had orderedthe price target increased dramatically to better please the issuer.113. Both the facts misrepresented and the facts omitted would have been important toa reasonable investor.15Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 15 of 25 Misrepresentations Concerning Nonexistent ""Customary Trading Restrictions""114. In or about August 2016, STE began adding language to the ""Disclosures"" portionof each STE research report, including initiation and update reports, stating that STE ""followscustomary internal trading restrictions pending the release of its reports.""115. That representation was false each time the Defendants made it, and it furtheredthe false impression that STE reports were not colored by the Tandons' financial interests.116. At no time did STE have any formal or informal trading restrictions, and theTandons observed no such restrictions.117. In fact, on at least one occasion described in more detail below, Ajay Tandonengaged in scalping of an STE-covered stock despite STE representing that it ""follow[ed]customary internal trading restrictions pending release of its report.""118. Specifically, on October 24, 2016, Ajay Tandon scalped an STE-covered stock(MassRoots, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MSRT)) on the same day that STE published a research report onthe issuer that contained the misrepresentation about `'customary internal trading restrictions.''Ajay Tandon Scalped Covered Stocks119. Making a stock recommendation and then contemporaneously trading against thatrecommendation without adequate disclosure of that trading is a form of securities fraud knownas ""scalping.""120. Ajay Tandon engaged in multiple instances of scalping between 2014 and thepresent.121. A representative example of Ajay Tandon's scalping occurred in 2014. In mid-January 2014, the issuer Medient Studios, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MDNT) was introduced to STE.16Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 16 of 25 122. By January 27, 2014, MDNT had agreed to pay STE several thousand dollars forresearch.123. On March 17, 2014, Ajay Tandon purchased $12,700 of MDNT stock-850,000shares, at an average share price of approximately $.015.124. The next dayŠMarch 18, 2014STE published its initiation report on MDNT,with a price target of $.13, more than eight tunes the price Ajay Tandon paid for his shares theday prior.125. Also on March 18, MDNT's stock price nearly doubledŠfrom approximately$.O1 to $.02Šand Ajay 'I'andon sold all 850,000 shares, for cone-day profit of approximately$6,500.126. The MDNT report's ""Disclosures"" stated only that ""SeeThru and/or its affiliatesmay have a long or short position with respect to the publicly traded shares of the subjectcompany covered in this report.''127. The report did not disclose that Ajay Tandon in fact owned MDNT shares or thathe was planning to sell them on the date of publication.128. Ajay Tandon engaged in similar scalping activityŠselling STE-covered stocksfor prices less than STE's price targets, within one to two days of STE publishing research on theissuers, and without disclosure in at least ten other issuers (including MSRT, as mentionedabove).129. Ajay Tandon generated approximately $20,000 in profits from those trades.130. The chart below includes the specifics of Ajay Tandon's repeated scalps of STE-covered stocks.17Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 17 of 25 TickerSeeThruReportDateAiay SaleDateTimeBetweenReportand AiaySalePriceTarget (PT) atTime ofScalpAiavSalePriceDifferenceAiayProfitBetweenAjay SalePrice andPTMDNT3/18/20143/18/2014Same day$0.13$0.02-$0.11$6,530.00OHGI5/13/20155/13/2015Same day$4.05$2.00-$2.05$4,892.10MHTX6/26/20146/27/2014One day$025$0.18-$0.07$2,652.50IGC5/6/20145/6/2014Same day$3.05$0.80-$2.25$1,783.92IGC4/21/20144/22/2014One day$3.05$0.84-$2.21$1,247.70MSRT10/24/201610/24/2016Same day$2.40$0.82-$1.58$1,201.50TPIV7/1/20147/1/2014Same day$6.97$1.95-$5.02$1,063.37NETE9/22/20149/23/2014One day$5.17$2.80-$2.37$406.50NNVC3/27/20143/27/2014Same day$7.21$3.65-$3.56$94.95BVAP6/18/20156/19/2015One day$0.35$0.09-$0.26$0.00HOTR1/20/20151/20/2015Same day$5.00$1.78-$3.22$0.00OXYS5/11/20155/13/2015Two days$2.30$0.70-$1.60$0.00131.

By reason of the","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a stock research firm and its co-founders with defrauding investors by issuing reports purportedly based on ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" research when in reality they received thousands of dollars from issuers as a condition to providing each report.  According to the SEC's complaint, SeeThruEquity LLC and brothers Ajay and Amit Tandon camouflaged the payments by inviting companies to make a ""presentation"" at an investor conference in order to receive a research report for free.  SeeThru and the Tandons allegedly collected up to several thousand dollars in conference presentation fees per company, and the issuers regularly had input into the substance of the supposedly unbiased research reports, even including the price targets at times. The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru's reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock.  The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.  According to the SEC's complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure.  ""There is a clear line between paid advertising and unbiased research coverage, and we allege that SeeThru and its co-founders crossed it to deceive investors and make money,"" said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office.  ""According to our complaint, Ajay Tandon even scalped multiple issuers, further revealing the biased nature of SeeThru's research reports.""  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Ajay and SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Amit with aiding and abetting those violations. It also charges SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; charges Ajay with violating the antifraud and antitouting provisions of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act; charges Amit with violating the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; and charges Ajay with aiding and abetting certain of SeeThru's antifraud and antitouting violations. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction that would bar Ajay, Amit, and SeeThru from promoting the issuer of any security, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director and penny stock bars.

They tricked investors into believing that they were funding fast-growing startup companies. They werenot.Liberty and his accomplices lied to those investors about the financ ial prospects of the startups, the use of their investment dollars, Liberty™s invol vement with the startups, and the nature of the investments offered.  Through these lies, Liberty and his accomplices enriched themselvesat the expense of  boththeinvestors and the startup companies.Thr ough their scheme, Liberty and his accomplices raised more than $55 million from hundreds of in vestors, misappropriating most of it to fund Liberty™s lifestyle, including chartered flights, a dairy cow farm, and the funding of a movie production.2.Defendants™fraudulent scheme center ed onMDO, a financial technology company(then known as Mozido LLC), and later on Mozido, Inc., which bought all of MDO™s assets.Liberty claimed to be th e founder of MDO and served as a de facto officer of MDO and Mozido, Inc.  From 2010 to 2017, Liberty and his as sociates used shell companies (for example, acompany Liberty named ﬁMozido Invescoﬂ) to raise money from hundreds of investors, who purchased securities in the form of promissory notes issued by the shell companieswithout active business operations.  Liberty and his associ ates represented that thesenotes provided a vehicle for investment in MDO. 3.To facilitate his frauds, Liberty enlisted his attorney George Marcus and his then- girlfriend and bookkeeper Brittany Abbass.  He re cruited his cousin Rick Liberty and Rick™s friend Paul Hess to promote and sellthe secur ities Liberty fraudulently offered.  And he used four shell companies to issue securities and one shell company to purchase and distribute  securitiesas an underwriter. Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 2 of 66    PageID #: 2 34.To sell thepromissory notesissued by his shell companies, Liberty and his associates misled investors by falsely representing that:  (1) the investors™money was going to  MDOto develop its technology and expand its ma rkets; (2) Liberty™s shell companies owned interests in MDOor had the authority to sell them;(3) MDO™s value was high and its financial  situation was very strong; (4) Liberty had invested tens of millions of dollars of his own money  into MDO;and (5) Liberty was financially able to honor the personal guaranteeshe provided to investors along withthe promissory notes.  In fact, (1) Liberty took the investors™ money for himself; (2) some of his shell companies did not own ownership units in MDO, and others held ownership units that they were prohibited from se lling; (3) MDOstruggled financially, defaulted on its debt, and was at times valued at less than 10% of what Liberty and his associates  representedto investors; (4) Liberty, at the time he was touting his large investment in the  company, had really invested less than $5 milliono f his own money; and (5) Liberty was in debt and had previously defaulted on personal guarantees to multiple investors.  In order to facilitate  his fraud scheme, Liberty hid his fundraising fr om MDOand failed to register the securities issued by his shell companies asrequired by S ection 5 of the Securities Act.  In addition, Liberty™s shell companies filed Form Ds with th e SECthatcontained materi al misrepresentations and omissions which reinforced Defendants™ false statements and furthered their fraudulent scheme.5.Beginning in2015, Liberty and his a ssociates conducted an additional unregistered offeringof securitiesrelating toa healthcare information technology company  called DaVincian Healthcare.  Liberty and his associates raised $6 million in that unregistered  securities offering.

RELATED ENTITIES 25.MDO, LLC (f/k/aMozido, LLC)is a limited liability company, organized under the laws of Delaware with a principal place of business in Austin, Texas.  MDO was formed in Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 8 of 66    PageID #: 8 9April 2008 as ﬁMobileFinancial Services, LLC. ﬂ  MDO operated under the names ﬁAffinity Global Services, LLCﬂ from 2008 to 2009and ﬁMozido, LLCﬂ from 2009 to 2015.  In March 2015, it became ﬁMDO, LLC.ﬂ In November 2013, MDO sold its assets to Mozido, Inc. 26.Mozido, Inc. is a corporation, organized under th e laws of Delaware, with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas. Mozido, Inc. was formed in 2013.  It acquired substantially all of MDO™s assets in November 2013. STATEMENT OF FACTS I.The Mozido Scheme A.MDO 27.MDO was a financial technology company focused on offering retail and business customers a ﬁmobile walletﬂ (a way for customer s to use their mobile phone to pay for products and transfer money).  MDO was started in 2008 as a subsidiary of Affinity Holding,LLC. 28.Liberty served on MDO™s Board of Directors until February 2011.  Later, he served as the Chairman of Global Strategic In itiatives for MDO, and then for Mozido, Inc.At various times, Liberty also took other titles, in cluding Vice-Chairman.These were lucrative arrangements for Liberty; he billed MDO hundr eds of thousands of dollars for travel and entertainment expenses he purportedly had incurred for MDO™s business purposes. 29.By 2010, MDO needed cash:  it was not pr oducing revenue and ha d lost itslargest investor.  30.In August 2010, anew investor, Mobile TechInvestments, LLC (ﬁMobile Techﬂ), invested $2.5 million in MDO, in exchange for a 15.6% share of the company (based upon a total Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 9 of 66    PageID #: 9 10valuation of $13.5 million, as approved by MDO™s Board of Directors).A portion of MDO™s remaining equity was owned by Affinity Holding, which in turn was owned by various persons and entities including Mozido Investments (a Liberty-controlled shell entity) and BRTMDO.  Liberty controlled Mozido Investments through his entity BRTMDO. 31.At the time of the investment, MDO executed an ﬁAmended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreementﬂ (ﬁAmended Operating Agreementﬂ).Liberty agreed to MDO™s  Amended Operating Agreement and personally signed on behalf of Mozido Investments, BRTMDO, and himself.  Marcus was the lawyer who negotiated with MobileTech over the amendments to MDO™s Operating Agreement. 32.As conditions for itsinfusion of capita l into MDO, the Amended Operating Agreement granted Mobile Tech a variety of prot ections, including preemptive rights (the right to acquirenewly issued MDO equity), tag-along ri ghts (the right to require a purchaser of MDO equity to purchase from Mobile Tech at the pur chaser™s proposed terms) and the right of first refusal (the right to acquire MDO equity from a seller at the terms proposed by the purchaser). 33.In particular, the Amended Operating Agreement grantedMobile TechaﬁRight of First Offerﬂ in equity interests of Mozi do Investments and BRTMDO. Under this provision, Liberty was required to notifyMobile Techprior to an y issuance or transfer of equity interests in Mozido Investments or BRTMDO.Mobile Tech then had an option to purchase the equity  interests itself or to require the proposed purch aser to purchase interests in MDO equities from Mobile Tech.The Amended Operating Agreemen t expressly provided that any transfer or issuance that violated these pr ovisions would be ﬁwholly void.ﬂ Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 10 of 66    PageID #: 10 11B.Liberty Enlists Hess to Market and Sell Securities 34.Concurrent with the MobileTech negotia tions, Liberty recruited Hess to promote MDO and to identify investors.  Hess began workin g as a self-described ﬁconsultant,ﬂ ﬁstrategic advisor,ﬂ or ﬁpartnerﬂ of MDO, promotingMDO to potential investors,and maintainingregular contact with them.  Liberty directed Hess to tout MDO, but actually had him sell securities  issued by the shell companies that Liberty controlled.  In exchange, Liberty (through his entities)  paidHess a5% commission on the money he raised. 35.Prior to December 31, 2010,Hess was a repr esentative at an investment advisory firm.  But all of his selling described in this Complaint was done outside his engagement with that investment advisory firm, contrary to th e firm™s policies.After that date, Hess was not licensed orworking for a registered broker-dealer. 36.Hess received a 5% commission from his fundraising.  Hess sent Abbass spreadsheets detailing what he had raised and what he was owed.  He also emailed her (e.g., on  September 9, 2010) to confirm how much money hadbeen received from his solicitationsand to request payments of his commi ssion or ﬁreferral bonus.ﬂ 37.By law, Hess was not permitted to rais e funds outside the supervision of the brokerage with which he was af filiated (a prohibite d practice known as ﬁselling awayﬂ).  Nor was he permitted to receive commissi ons or otherwise act as an unr egistered broker-dealer.  Yet, throughout the relevant time period, Hess did all of these things:  selling away, receiving improper commissions, and acting as an unregisteredbroker-dealer. 38.To hide his misconduct and his unlawfu l receipt of 5% commissions for every sale, Hess repeatedly told inve stors he was not receiving commissions.  For example, on October Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 11 of 66    PageID #: 11 125, 2010, Hess wrote to potential invest ors and falsely stated that, ﬁ[t]his is not registered with an investment bank or broker-dealer, and there are no fees or commission paid.ﬂ  On November 26, 2010, Hess lied to another potential investor, stating, ﬁI receive no commission or comp on any money raised (no investment bank or broker involved)–ﬂ C.The Mozido Invesc oSecurities Offering :  August 2010-May 2012 39.The first securities offering in the De fendants™ fraudulent scheme was the Mozido Invescopromissory note offering(ﬁMozido InvescoOfferingﬂ).  The Mozido InvescoOffering  ran from August 2010 through May 2012, and raised appr oximately $18.2 million. 40.Mozido Invesco was formed on August 26, 2010.  Marcus provided legal assistance to form Mozido Invesco. Abbass arranged for the creation of a Mozido Invesco bank  account into which investors could wire in their investments, and told Hess to direct investormoney to that account. 41.On or about August 26, 2010, Liberty caused BRTMDO to transfer 120 Mozido Investment membership units to Mozido Invesco. Because Liberty failed to notify Mobile Tech in advance of the transfer, the transfer was void pursuant to MDO™s operating agreement. 42.The Mozido Invesco Offering consisted of securities that were styled as ﬁconvertible promissory notes.ﬂ  By their terms, the promissory notes promised 5% interest and matured in December 2015.  They included a right to convert the note into membership units of Mozido Investments at a price of $55,000 per un it.  These convertible promissory notes constitute securities under federa l securities law.To entice investors, Liberty personally guaranteed the convertible promissory notes offered by Mozido Invesco. Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 12 of 66    PageID #: 12 1343.Marcus drafted the original Mozido I nvesco promissory notes, note purchase agreements, and Liberty™s personal guarantee, wh ich he knew misrepresente d material facts and made material omissions.44.In a classic bait-and-switch, in seekin g investors for their fraudulent offering, Liberty and Hess touted the merits of investing in MDOto potential investors.But they actually sold investors promissory notes issued by Liberty™s shell company, Mozido Invesco,even though  Mozido Invesco was expressly barredfrom selling inte rests without prior notice to and a lack of objectionfrom Mobile Tech, under the terms of th e Amended Operating Agreement that Liberty had signed. 45.In touting the Mozido Invesco Offering, LibertyandHess (with Marcus™ assistance) repeatedly lied about and/orc oncealed critical facts about the investment: First, they misrepresented the financia l position and business prospects of MDO, representing to potential investors that the MDO was valued at many multiples of what they knew the company had valued itself. Second, they misrepresented what the inve stment proceeds would be used for, repeatedly touting the effect the inves tments would have on pr oduct development, product launches, and lu crative business deals.  In fact, Liberty divertedmost of the money for his personal use. Third, they misrepresented and/or conceal ed critical facts about the conversion feature of the promissory notes, including that anyattempted transfers of interest in Mozido Investments were void unde r the terms of an MDO Operating Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 13 of 66    PageID #: 13 14Agreement that Liberty had signed. Fourth, they misrepresented and concealed cr itical facts about Liberty™s role in the investments and relationship withMDO and the Mozido Invesco investors, including that: (a) Liberty™s personal financial guarantee was of limited value  given that Liberty was struggling financ ially,and (b) that Liberty™s financial interests were not aligned with those of the investors and that Liberty was actively working to dilute their investments. Defendants™ misrepresentations and material omissions are detailed further below. 46.Valuations of MDO: Hessand Liberty(with Marcus™ assistance)knowingly made repeated misrepresentationsand omitted material information to investors and potential  investors about the valuations of MDO durin g the Mozido Invesco Offering.  For instance: a.On September 14, 2010, Hess (with Libe rty™s and Marcus™ knowledge) told prospective investorsthat the ﬁsharesﬂ of Mozido Investments were valued at $55 million and that the ﬁprivate round of money ra ising (pretty much all by me)ﬂ put the value of MDO ﬁcloser to $85 million Œstill very much a bargain–.ﬂ  These  valuations were fictitious.Both Marcus and Liberty knew that MDO™s Board of  Directors hadvalued the company at no more than $16 millionat that time. b.In August 2010, after reviewing MDO™s fi nancial statements, Hess and Liberty agreed not to send them or the numbers to i nvestors.  They were too negative.  Hess told Liberty that he would work to ge nerate something that looked better and ﬁsomewhat ‚official.™ﬂ c.On November 26, 2010, Hess told investor s that MDO was ﬁarguably worth a solid Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 14 of 66    PageID #: 14 15$1bill[ion]+ﬂ and that the inve stment ﬁopportunity exists for my friends only!ﬂ  This statement was baseless; MDO valuations never approached $1 billionin this time  period.d.Also on November 26, Hess told an investor that MDO ﬁhas no commercial debt–and is allowing me to raise capital at a valuation that is substantially lower than  any measure of true market value would suggest–ﬂ Notso.  MDO, in fact, had  considerable debt, knew nothingof Hess™s solicitation efforts,a nd was not ﬁallowingﬂ him to do anything. 47.Use of Investment Proceeds: During the Mozido Invesco Offering, Liberty and Hess repeatedly misrepresented to investors that their money was going to go directly to MDO to be used for MDO™s development and deployment of new products and to maintain a cash-rich balance sheet.  They fraudulently represented th at these new products would quickly generate millions, if not billions, of dollars of revenue.For example: a.On October 6, 2010, Hess emailed a potentia l investor that ﬁMozido Invesco LLC was set up specifically – for this special final-yard opportunity to help [MDO] over the goal line and off the launching pad.ﬂ b.Later, Hess (with Liberty™s approval) told an investor that ﬁwe do have plenty of cash well into the first quarterﬂ and that more wa s coming.  He then stated that the money from the Mozido Invesco Offering ﬁwill enable us to power the Wal-Mart deal  immediately from day one–.ﬂ c.On November 26, 2010, Hess solic ited another potential inve stor by telling him that the cash was needed by MDO ﬁto kick off several upcoming deployments."" Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 15 of 66    PageID #: 15 16d.On February 14, 2011, Hess falsely told invest ors, ""[f]olks, we are about to become cash-flow positive–ﬂ and that his fundraisi ng was needed only ﬁso that we have plenty of working capital and a flush bala nce sheet while we are negotiating with customers/partners and putting money out for new deployments."" e.On July 22, 2011, Hess falsely stated that MDO was raising additional money from existing investors to ﬁkeep our coffers loaded with cash.ﬂ Each of these representations was false, misleading, and omitted necessary material facts.  MDO™s ﬁcoffersﬂ were not loaded with cash a nd the money from Mozido Invesco investors was not used to fill them.Nor did most of the inve stor money reach MDO to deploy new products or to further new deals with other companies. 48.In fact, Liberty, Abbass, and Hess pocke ted the bulk of the money raised from investors in the Mozido Invesco Offering, approximately 90% of the $18.2 million raised: a.Abbass and others transferred approx imately $16 million of the $18.2 raised in the Mozido Invesco Offering to the Xana duPartners bank account (which Liberty and Abbass used as theirpersonal bank account) to fund Liberty™s other businesses; purchaseMozido Invesco(w ith Liberty and Abbass becoming the new Mozido Invesco managers);pay creditors; pay disgorgement Liberty owed to  the SECfrom the prior Keystone case(described below); settle lawsuits and pay judgments against him; fund a movie Abba ss was producing; and, to pay for gas, groceries, a dairy cow farm, interior deco rating, chartered flights, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit card bills. (Liberty did not maintain a bank account in his own name.  Instead, heused the bank accounts of the companies he Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 16 of 66    PageID #: 16 17controlled and the client funds (IOLTA) account at Marcus™ law firm for his personal expenses); and, b.Liberty and Abbass paid Hess more than $890,000 in commissions, approximately 5% of the money Hess ra ised for the Mozido Invesco Offering. 49.Authorization to Sell Units: Liberty and Marcus intentionally concealed that both their transfer of 120 Mozido Investments units to Mozido Invesco and any subsequent transfer of those units to the Mozido Inve sco investors were voi d under MDO™s Amended Operating Agreement. In fact, the Mozido Inve sco Offering Documentsincluded an express false representationthat the transfer was not in vi olation of any other agreement.  In addition, in multiple periods, Mozido Invesco had oversold the number of units it actually held. 50.Liberty™s Alignment with Investors: Hess and Liberty falsely told potential investors that, because they were invested through Liberty™s entity, Mozido Investments, Liberty  shared their interest in protecting Mozido Investments from dilution(that is, a reduction in  ownership percentage of the company, a nd thus, reduction in value).  For example: a.On September 14, 2010, Hess falsely wrote to investors, ﬁMichael would not just dilute his own personal holdingsﬂ; ﬁrem ember MICHAEL LIBERTY, PAUL HESS, AND–ARE ALL ALIGNED WITH THE EXACT SAME interests as all of you!!ﬂ b.But on January 19, 2011, Liberty formed a new entity, Family Mobile, LLC, to loan money to MDO.  Liberty caused Xanadu to transfer a relatively small amount of money to MDO in the name of Family Mobile.  In exchange, Family Mobile participated in a promissory notewith a righ t to convert the note into preferred units of MDO (at a valuation of $13.5 million, far lo wer than what Liberty™s investors had Case 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 17 of 66    PageID #: 17 18been told). Later that year,Liberty caused Family Mobile to make additional loans to MDO (via Xanadu), becauseMDO still had not generated any meaningful revenue. Family Mobile™sloans to MDOsignificantly diluted the investments of the Mozido  Invesco investors.  Worse yet, some of the loan money had originally come from the  Mozido Invesco investors.  In other word s, Mozido Invesco investors were diluted with their own money. c.On June 16, 2011, Hess (with Liberty™s kno wledge) told potential investors that ﬁsince Michael Liberty is controlling owner and decides upon any new investments  into [MDO], we are totally protected since in the event of dilution,he is dilutedas  well -in the exact same percentage –.ﬂ d.On July 22,2011,during a conference call in which he solicited additional investment from investors, Liberty discussed the potential for dilutionfrom employee stock  options while omitting to mention how he had and intended to continue diluting those  investors.e.In December 2011, Hess asked Liberty if he could tell investors th at Liberty was able to invest in MDO at lower valuations(i.e ., at a lower price per membership unit). Liberty told Hess to hide the lower valuati ons from investors, saying he wanted to ﬁsurpriseﬂ investors later with news that he was going to reduce their effective  purchase price.  He instructed Hess to tell investors that Liberty ﬁcontinually sweetened the potﬂ and that he was a ﬁtremendou s partnerﬂ and ﬁso lo yal to his team.ﬂ But Liberty never did disclose MDO™s lower valuations to investors or ﬁsweeten the pot.ﬂCase 2:18-cv-00139-DBH   Document 1   Filed 03/30/18   Page 18 of 66    PageID #: 18 19f.On September 4, 2012, Marcus wrote to an inve stor™s representative, ﬁit is clearly in Mike™s and everyone™s interest to make sure that further equity raises –would not be dilutive on a value basis,ﬂ and that there was ﬁa commonality of interest with Mike  and every other investor.ﬂ Each of these statements was misleading, and omitted material information, as Liberty, and Marcusknew at the time.  In fact, Liberty had used the Mozido Invesco investors™ own money to  dilute their interests in MDO.  Liberty and Hess continued to promote Mozido Invesco, offer Mozido Invesco notes, raise money from existing and new investors, a nd update investors on their investment, without disclosing investors the dilution or that MDO™s actual valuation was 10% of what they were paying. 51.Personal Investment: When soliciting investors, Liberty claimed he had invested tens of millions of dollars of his own moneyin MDO.  As Liberty well knew, such information is  material toinvestors, particul arly investors in newly established companies.  Liberty intentionally misrepresented that he had investeda considerable amount of his own money.  For example: a.In May 2011, Li","The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Michael Liberty, the founder of the fintech startup now known as Mozido, Inc., with a fraudulent scheme to trick hundreds of investors into investing in his shell companies instead of Mozido. Michael Liberty and his accomplices then stole most of the more than $48 million raised to fund a lavish lifestyle that included private jet flights, multi-million dollar residences, expensive cars, and movie production ventures.  The SEC's complaint, filed March 30, 2018, alleges that Michael Liberty, his wife, Brittany Liberty, his cousin, Richard Liberty, Paul Hess, and attorney George Marcus induced investors to purchase unregistered interests in shell companies controlled by Michael Liberty that supposedly owned transferrable interests in Mozido. In reality, the shell companies either did not own, or were not permitted to transfer, interests in the company. The SEC also alleges that Michael Liberty and his accomplices lied to investors about Mozido's valuation and finances, the amount Michael Liberty had personally invested in Mozido, and the use of their funds. According to the complaint, Michael Liberty and his accomplices later orchestrated a series of transactions in which they used investors' own money to heavily dilute their interests and duped investors into trading securities for those worth more than 90% less.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Maine, charges Defendants with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Michael Liberty; Brittany Abbass Liberty (""Abbass""); Richard Liberty; Hess; Marcus; Brentwood Financial, LLC (""Brentwood Financial""); BRTMDO Investments, LLC (""BRTMDO""); Family Mobile, LLC (""Family Mobile""); and Mozido Invesco, LLC (""Mozido Invesco"") violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, Marcus, Brentwood Financial, BRTMDO, Family Mobile, and Mozido Invesco aided and abetted those violations. It also alleges that Liberty, Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, Marcus, Brentwood Financial, BRTMDO, Mozido Invesco, Family Mobile, and TL Holdings Group, LLC violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and, in the alternative, Liberty, Abbass, Richard Liberty, Hess, and Marcus aided and abetted those violations. Finally, the complaint alleges that Hess and Richard Liberty violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Xanadu Partners, LLC has been named as a relief defendant.  The litigation is being led by Marc Jones, Peter Bryan Moores, Trevor Donelan, and Kevin Currid of the SEC's the Boston Regional Office."

Lollar illegally used information learned in the course of his employment to enrich himself by trading ahead of the company™s September 7, 2016  announcement of the discovery of a significant new resource play referred to as the ﬁAlpine  Highﬂ (the ﬁAlpine High Announcementﬂ).  In th e days and weeks leading to the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar conducted trades in shares and call option contracts in Apache stock that resulted in total profits of $214,295.07. 2.From January 2014 through December 2016, Lollar worked as a petroleum engineer in Apache™s San Antonio office, where the geologic and geophysical work to explore and develop the Alpine High was performed.  In this capacity, he learned inside information Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 1 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 2 of 12 Complaint about the company™s intention to announce the Alpine High resource play.  After obtaining this material, nonpublic information, Lollar placed, and pr ofited from, illegal trades in shares and call option contracts in Apache stock. 3. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Lollar violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Sec tion 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder. 4. The Commission, in the interest of prot ecting the securities markets from any further unscrupulous and illegal activity, brings this action against Lollar, seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all illicit trading profits he received, plus accrued prejudgment interest, and civil m onetary penalties.

Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 2 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 3 of 12 Complaint DEFENDANT 9. Christopher J. Lollar, age 29, resides in Houston, Texas.  From January 2014 until June 2017, Lollar was a petroleum engineer for Apache Corporation.  From January 2014 through December 2016, he worked in Apache™s San Antonio, Texas office.  In January 2017, Lollar relocated to Apache™s Houston, Texas headquarters where he worked until the company terminated him in June 2017 for breaching its Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   RELATED ENTITY 10. Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.  At all relevant times, Apache™s co mmon stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ﬁAPA.ﬂ STATEMENT OF FACTS  Lollar Joins Apache as a Petroleum Engineer 11. After interning with Apache during the summers of 2012 and 2013, Lollar went to work for the company full-time in January 2014 as a petroleum engineer in the Petroleum Engineering Development Program.  At the time he made the illegal trades, Lollar worked in the Unconventional Resource Drilling Department (ﬁ URD Departmentﬂ) in Apache™s San Antonio office. 12. Upon accepting his internships and full- time position with the company, Lollar acknowledged in writing that he had read, and agreed to abide by, Apache™s corporate codes and policies, including its Code of Business Conduct and Insider Trading Policy.   Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 3 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 4 of 12 Complaint 13. Apache™s Code of Business Conduct prohibited Lollar from ﬁusing corporate property, information or position for personal gain.ﬂ It also prohibited Lollar from disclosing confidential information and from appropriati ng such information for his own use. 14. Apache™s Insider Trading Policy prohibit ed Lollar from trading on material, nonpublic information learned thr ough employment with the co mpany.  The policy included a non-exhaustive list of the type of information the company considers to be material, including ﬁsignificant expansion or curtailment of operationsﬂ and ﬁsignificant new services or discoveries.ﬂ  Apache™s Insider Trading Policy specifically warned Lollar about trading ahead of import newsŠlike the Alpine High Announcemen tŠcautioning that ﬁ[p]erhaps the most dangerous time to engage in a purchase or sale of Apache securities is sh ortly in advance of a public release of important material information–.ﬂ Background on Apache™s Decision to Announce the Alpine High 15. From approximately 2014 through mid-2016, Apache worked to develop the Alpine High resource play through extensive geologic and geophysical work, land accumulation, strategic testing and delineation drilling.  On July 14, 2016, Apache personnel gave a presentation on the Alpine High to Apache™s Board of Directors and certain senior executives (the ﬁBoard Presentationﬂ).  A group of seven San Antonio-based engineers and geologists who had worked on developing the Alpine High, and with whom Lollar worked, assisted in the preparation of the Board Presentation.  It was made clear to the employees working on the Board Presentation that the presentation was confidential.  Although Lollar worked with these employees, he did not work on the Board Presentation. 16. After the Board Presentation, Apache made the decision to publicly announce the Alpine High resource play.  Between August 25, 2016 and September 2, 2016, Apache drafted a press release which it planned to issue on September 7, 2016, before the company™s CEO Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 4 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 5 of 12 Complaint presented at the 2016 Barclays CEO Energy-Powe r Conference (the ﬁB arclays Conferenceﬂ).  Certain company executives, outside financial consultants, and employees specializing in public and investor relations were provided drafts of the press release and the Barclays Conference presentation for their review and comment be fore both were finalized on September 6, 2016. 17. At 6:40 a.m. (ET), before the markets opened on September 7, 2016, Apache made the Alpine High Announcement.  In response to the news, Apache™s stock traded as high as $58.99 per share on September 7, 2016 before clos ing at $55.13 per shareŠan approximately 6.7% increase from the prior day™s closing shar e price of $51.67.  Trading volume that day also increased dramatically to over 14.5 million shares compared with Apache™s historical average daily volume of approximately 2.7 million shar es for the month preceding the Alpine High Announcement. Lollar™s Illegal Trading in Apache Securities 18. In the days and weeks following Apache™s decision to announce the Alpine High, Lollar traded Apache securities in two brokerage accounts: (1) his Fidelity Roth IRA account ending 9413 (the ﬁFidelity accountﬂ); and (2 ) his OptionsHouse account ending 0573 (the ﬁOptionsHouse accountﬂ).   Trading in the Fidelity Account 19. Lollar opened the Fidelity account on February 24, 2016.  There is no evidence that Lollar traded in Apache securities in the Fidelity account prior to August 2016. 20. In August 2016, Lollar sold all of the securities he held in the Fidelity account.  He used the proceeds from that sale, and almost all the cash in the account, to purchase a total of 461 shares of Apache common stock on August 18 and 23, 2016, at a total cost of approximately  $24,580.60 (excluding commissions or ot her transaction fees).  He made these purchases after the Board Presentation and Apache™s decision to publicly announce the Alpine High.  Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 5 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 6 of 12 Complaint 21. On September 9, 2016, two days after the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar sold all 461 shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $26,954.67 and a net profit of $2,374.07.   Trading in the OptionsHouse Account 22. Lollar opened the OptionsHouse account on January 16, 2015.  Prior to September 6, 2016, no Apache securities were trad ed in the OptionsHouse account. 23. On September 1, 2016, in a recorded tele phone call to OptionsHouse™s customer service department, Lollar expressed concern about a notice he received that a $5,000 incoming electronic transfer or deposit request (the ﬁDeposit Requestﬂ) into the OptionsHouse account would not be available until September 8, 2016. Lollar asked that the Deposit Request be cancelled and that a wire transfer be initiated the next day (September 2, 2016) so that the funds would be available immediately for a trade he wanted to make ﬁon [the] open of next week which would be Tuesday, the 7th [of September].ﬂ 1  Lollar was told the Deposit Request was still in progress and that there might be a chance it could be cancelled. 24. OptionsHouse did in fact cancel the Deposit Request.  OptionsHouse account records reflect that $5,000 was deposited in Lollar™s account on September 2, 2016.  An additional $1,200 was wired into Lollar™s Op tionsHouse account on September 6, 2016.  That same day, Lollar used the wired funds and ex isting margin funds to purchase 490 Apache call option contracts in the OptionsHouse account at a cost of approximately $7,275.00. 25. The options had an expiration date of September 9, 2016, and strike prices that varied between $52.50 and $53.50.  Apache™s stock price on September 6, 2016 opened at 1  On this call, Lollar incorrectly stated that the following Tuesday was September 7th.  In fact, he needed the funds available to purchase the three-day options contracts on Tuesday, September 6, 2016, in advance of Apache™s Alpine High Announcement, which took place before the markets opened on Wednesday, September 7, 2016.  The markets were closed on Monday, September 5, 2016, for the Labor Day holiday. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 6 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 7 of 12 Complaint $51.38, had a high of $52.00 and closed at $51.67, thus the three-day options were out-of-the-money when Lollar bought them.  For Lollar™s ca ll options to be in-the-money on September 6, 2016, Apache™s closing stock price would have ha d to have been higher by between $.84 to $1.84, or 1.6% and 3.7%, respectively, as summarized below: Strike Price No. of Option Contracts Apache Closing Price on 9/6/2016 Min. Increase in 9/6/16 Close  to be in-the-money % Increase $52.50 35 $51.67 $.84 1.6% $53.00 105 $51.67 $1.34 2.6% $53.50 350 $51.67 $1.84 3.7% 26. As this chart shows, Lollar expected a market moving event to take place in connection with Apache™s stock before Septembe r 9, 2016.  Notably, Apache had no earnings or other announcements scheduled between September 6 and 9, 2016.  On September 6, 2016,  Apache announced on its Facebook page and LinkedIn account that Apache™s CEO would be  making a presentation at the Barclays Confer ence on September 7, 2016, but no specifics were provided about the content of the presentation.      27. On September 7, 2016, later the same da y of the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar sold all 490 Apache call option contracts, resulting in to tal proceeds of approximately $219,196.00, and profits of approximately $211,921.00.  Th ese profits far exceeded the profits of any of Lollar™s other options trading in the OptionsHouse account since its inception in January 2015. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 7 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 8 of 12 Complaint 28. Because of the high percentage change in the value of the OptionsHouse account, 2 OptionsHouse opened its own internal fraud investigation into Lollar™s trading in Apache securities on September 8, 2016.  OptionsHouse u ltimately closed Lollar™s account on September 12, 2016, and he was informed of its decision on September 20, 2016. Summary of Illegal Trading Activity and Profits 29. The following table summarizes Lollar™s trading profits in Apache stock and options (excluding commissions and other tran saction fees) during the relevant period: Stock Purchases and Sales (Fidelity Account) Trade Date Buy Quantity (Shares) Sell Quantity (Shares) Share Price Purchase Costs Sales Proceeds Profit 8/18/2016 250  $53.55 $13,380.15 $2,374.07 8/23/2016 211  $53.12 $11,200.45 9/9/2016  (461) $58.47  $26,954.67 TOTAL  (461) $24,580.60 $26,954.67 Call Option Purchases and Sales (OptionsHouse Account) Trade Date Strike Price Buy Quantity  No. of Contracts Sell Quantity No. of Contracts Unit Price Purchase Costs Sales Proceeds Profit 9/6/2016 $52.50 35  $.29 $1,015.00 $211,921.00 9/6/2016 $53.00 105  $.18-$.22 $2,110.00 9/6/2016 $53.50 150  $.11-$.13 $4,150.00 9/7/2016 $52.50  (35) $4.70  $16,450.00 9/7/2016 $53.00  (105) $4.15-$5.58  $51,415.00 9/7/2016 $53.50  (350) $3.27- $4.80  $151,331.00 TOTAL  (490) $7,275.00 $219,196.00 TOTAL COMBINED TRADING PROFITS $214,295.07 Lollar™s Inside Information 30. Lollar had ample opportunity to learn inside information about the impending Alpine High Announcement through his work as a pe troleum engineer for Apache.  At the time 2  The value of Lollar™s OptionsHouse account increased by approximately 2,700% between September 6, 2016 (account value of $7,478) and September 7, 2016 (account value of $212,639.41). Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 8 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 9 of 12 Complaint he made the illegal trades, Lollar was working in the URD Department in Apache™s San Antonio office where the geologic and geophysical work that went into developing the Alpine High occurred.  In this position, Lollar worked alongside the team of engineers and geologists that were actively working on the development of the Alpine Hig h.  During the course of his employment, Lollar had regular contact wit h, and access to, many of the engineers and geologists that assisted in preparing the Board Presentation.  He also would have been provided high level information about the development of the Alpine High through staff meetings and daily email reports. 31. In addition to Lollar™s suspiciously timed trades and his access to Apache™s San Antonio-based URD Department, it is clear that Lollar illegally traded based on material, non- public information because: a. Lollar liquidated all the securities in his Fidelity account and used the proceeds, along with almost all the availa ble cash in the account, to purchase Apache stock shortly before the Alpine High Announcement; b. Lollar used almost all of the availa ble funds in his OptionsHouse account to purchase Apache stock options.  No other securities were held, acquired, or sold in September 2016 in the OptionsHouse account; c. Lollar™s September 1, 2016 telephone call to OptionsHouse revealed that he was concerned about transferring funds into the OptionsHouse account prior to September 6th so he could purchase the cal l option contracts before the Alpine High Announcement; d. Lollar purchased out-of-the-money call option contracts with a three-day expiration period, evidencing a high degree of confidence in the likely outcome of the trade; Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 9 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 10 of 12 Complaint e. The accounts in which Lollar made th ese purchases never maintained a position in Apache securities prio r to the subject purchases; f. When questioned about the trades by Commission staff, Lollar made many statements that were contradicted by information found in the public domain and elsewhere; and  g. Apache terminated Lollar in June 2017 for breaching the company™s Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   32. In short, Lollar was willing to liquidate his Fidelity account to purchase Apache stockŠwhich he had never purchased in that account beforeŠand was willing to bet all of the funds in his OptionsHouse account on a rapid incr ease in the price of Apache stock in just a three-day time frame.  He was only willing to make this bet because of the inside information he had obtainedŠthat Apache was about to make a major public announcement about the Alpine High play.  He then used that inside informa tion to make illegal insider trades and realized substantial profits as a result.
