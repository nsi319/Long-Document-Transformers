Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut resident David S. Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors. Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC. Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012. He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds. According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad. Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors. The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of these laws. Haddad and Trafalgar also have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $619,382.43 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,131.83. Haddad and New England Re have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $269,080 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest $2,592.66. In addition, Haddad has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $181,071 and has consented to the imposition of a permanent bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company. Haddad further has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from providing information to, soliciting, or accepting investments or funds from any investor or potential investors regarding the offer or sale of any securities issued by any entity that he directly or indirectly owns, controls, consults for, or is employed by, unless he first provides such person with a written disclosure regarding his prior regulatory history and maintains written records of such disclosures.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ellen B. Moynihan, Deena R. Bernstein, Sofia T. Hussain, and Kevin B. Currid of the Boston Regional Office.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut-based insurance agent David S. Haddad and two companies he controlled, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC, with conducting a fraudulent scheme to raise at least $2.5 million from investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that from April 2012 through August 2016, the three companies engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which they solicited investors to invest in their companies and to fund the operations and growth of the companies. The complaint alleges, among other misstatements and omissions, that the defendants raised funds from retail investors, art and antiques, entertainment, and a dog rescue charity, while failing to disclose to investors that they were raising funds to build and grow the company's business. According to the complaint:  HADDad, through his companies, used investor funds for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes and art projects, entertaining at his properties, retail and veterinary services expenses, remodeling his home, dining and dining at several of his residences, purchasing a house for himself, renovating his apartment, buying a home and other personal items, making payments to earlier investors and making P&L payments in the name of a charity he co-owned with the entities. In addition to raising money from the investor's funds, defendants also allegedly diverted a significant portion of investor money for their own use.Â  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced parallel criminal charges against defendants, who were previously convicted of securities fraud and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 years to 30 years. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty and an officer-and-director bar. Defendants also agreed to pay a total of $1.6 million in disgorge and prejudicial interest.

Actual Summary:
On November 14, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission added Francisco Martin of Woodland Hills, California to a civil injunctive action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging him with defrauding investors in sham Native American tribal bonds.  The SEC's amended complaint alleges that Martin, along with seven other co-defendants, participated in a scheme to convince a Native American tribal corporation affiliated with the Wakpamni District of the Oglala Sioux Nation to issue limited recourse bonds that Jason Galanis and his father, John Galanis, had already structured.  As Jason Galanis allegedly told two of his associates, the &quot;primary objective&quot; of the scheme was to provide Jason Galanis and his associates &quot;a source of discretionary liquidity.&quot;  Jason Galanis then allegedly acquired two investment advisory firms and installed officers to arrange the purchase of $43 million in bonds using clients' funds.  The amended complaint further alleges that in exchange for $150,000 from Jason Galanis, Martin served as the &quot;Managing Director&quot; or &quot;Portfolio Manager&quot; of a fake entity that was held out to bond investors as an independent investment manager for the bond proceeds.  Through his role with the fake investment manager, Martin facilitated the transfer of proceeds from investors in the tribal bonds to Jason Galanis and his associates.  The SEC further alleges that instead of investing bond proceeds as promised in annuities to benefit the tribal corporation and generate sufficient income to repay bondholders, the money wound up in a bank account in Florida belonging to a company controlled by Jason Galanis and his associates.Â  Among their alleged misuses of the misappropriated funds were luxury purchases at such retailers as Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Barneys, Prada, and Gucci, and to support an IPO of a technology company in which Jason Galanis and several other defendants had interests. Â  Investor money also was diverted to pay attorneys representing Jason and John Galanis in a separate criminal case brought parallel to the SEC's stock fraud charges last year.  In addition to Martin, and Jason and John Galanis, the amended complaint also names as defendants Devon Archer of Brooklyn, N.Y., Bevan Cooney of Incline Village, Nev., Hugh Dunkerley of Irvine, Calif., Gary Hirst of Lake Mary, Fla.,Â  and Michelle Morton of Colonia, N.J., all of whom were charged in the original complaint in this matter.  The amended complaint charges Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst, Jason Galanis, John Galanis and Martin with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Morton with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and Section 209(f) of the Advisers Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  In addition, the Commission alleges, in the alternative, that Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst, John Galanis and Martin violated Section 15(b) of the Securities Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 20(3) of the Exchange Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC seeks disgorgement plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctions against all defendants, and officer-and-director bars against Jason Galanis, Archer, Dunkerley, and Morton.  Jason and John Galanis, Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst and Morton were also charged criminally by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The criminal action is still pending.  The SEC's litigation is being led by Nancy A. Brown, Tejal Shah, and H. Gregory Baker, and is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 23535 (May 11, 2016).
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a California man and six of his associates for orchestrating a fraudulent and unregistered securities scheme.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Devon D. Archer, Bevan T. Gooney, John P. Galanis, and Gary A. Hirst of Oceanside, California, aided and abetted Jason Galananis's scheme to obtainundisclosed control over two investment advisers so that over $43 million of their clients' funds could be invested in sham Native American tribal bonds. According to the complaint, the defendants used the funds to fund the Tribal Bonds' issuance and to pay personal expenses, including purchasing luxury goods, paying the criminal defense costs of John and Bevans' father and mother-in-law and other business expenses. The complaint further alleges Jason Galanis enlisted the assistance of another investment adviser, a fake entity created at the direction of a U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, to orchestrate payments to a Tribal Bond indenture trust that was not registered with the SEC. In a parallel action filed in federal district court in Manhattan on September 5, 2015, unsealed on consent and without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's action, all defendants consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in alternative, ordering Jason to disgorge $16.2 million in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $160,000, against John Galais and $20,500 in disgorgement, $1,065 in pre-announcement interest, with a $10,700 penalty, from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years and from participating in a public offering of "Technology Company" in which he, Archer and Cooney had interests.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.

Actual Summary:
On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy "Lee" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. According to the SEC's complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings. In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments.  Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450. The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval. Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan. According to the SEC's orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young's investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young's antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Emily Shea and supervised by Kevin Guerrero and Antonia Chion.

On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Leroy "Lee" Young and Young Capital Management, LLC, an investment advisory firm based in Carlsbad, California, for conducting a fraudulent and unregistered offering of securities.  According to the SEC's complaint, from January 2013 through September 2017, Young, a self-employed California resident, raised at least $362,000 from 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment and for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint alleges that Young falsely represented to investors that he would use their money for legal fees or other expenses, when in reality he simply spent the investors' money on personal expenses and on his own expenses. To date, he has not paid his investors the promised returns nor returned any of their investments.Â  The SEC further alleges Young violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the securities laws and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration requirements for securities offerings. Young has also been charged with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(e) in the Commission's Complaint and Rules 15e-1, 16a-2, 17a–3, 18a and 18b2-4, under the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC case, YCM has consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $5,500, as well as a $1.2 million civil monetary penalty.

Currid entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Young to disgorge $2.5 million in illusory profits, pay a penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that former financial adviser James C. Tao has agreed to settle charges that he defrauded investors in Presidio Venture Capital, a private equity fund he created and managed, by making material misstatements in offering documents and misappropriating investor funds.  Tao and his former partner, Donna Boyd (f/k/a Donna Chen), also settled charges for violating broker-dealer registration requirements by soliciting sales of interests in the funds, which were securities not offered by the brokerage firm with which they were associated at the time.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, while working as financial advisers associated with a registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, Tao and Boyd formed private equity fund PVC, LLC - which did business as Presidio Venture Capital - in 2013 primarily for the purpose of investing in technology start-ups in the Houston, Texas area.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Tao and Boyd raised approximately $860,000 for the fund between January 2013 and July 2016 by soliciting investments from their advisory clients, some of whom were also brokerage clients, and from other personal and business contacts.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Tao falsely claimed investor funds would be held in escrow and returned unless $2.5 million was raised.  The complaint further alleges that while some of the money PVC raised was invested in arms-length transactions that fit the fund's stated business model, Tao failed to timely or adequately disclose that the fund was also investing in companies he owned or in which he had a personal stake, which was a clear conflict of interest.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Tao used investor funds to apply for a loan to increase his interest in the fund, cover other expenses not in line with the use of funds disclosed in PVC's offering materials, and make a Ponzi-style payment by using new investor funds to buy out a disgruntled investor.  The complaint also alleges that Tao ignored fund redemption restrictions and bought out Boyd, who severed ties with the fund in 2013, and at least three other investors with cash from the sale of one of PVC's early investments.  The SEC's complaint charges Tao with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  It also charges Tao and Boyd with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Tao and Boyd have agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Tao has agreed to injunctions and to pay disgorgement of $155,970.67, interest of $7,965.65, and a penalty of $150,000.00.  Boyd has agreed to an injunction and to pay a $10,000.00 penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  Both defendants have also agreed to follow-on collateral administrative bars.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer R. Turner and Ty S. Martinez and supervised by Jessica B. Magee and Shamoil T. Shipchandler of the Fort Worth Regional Office with assistance from Deborah Shaw, Dale R. Perez, Carole A. Solloway, and Caneka F. Hardon of the Atlanta Regional Office exam staff.  The litigation is led by Keefe Bernstein.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Houston, Texas resident James C. Tao and Donna Boyd with defrauding investors in a Houston-area technology start-up fund.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2012 through 2016, Tao, who was associated with the registered firm, formed a private equity fund called PVC, LLC (PVC) to purportedly invest in the Houston area. The fund raised approximately $860,000 for the accounts of approximately 25 investors located in multiple states, and the majority of the investors were brokerage customers. As alleged, the funds were used to buy out investors, which was a clear conflict of interest for Tao. To conceal the nature of his fraud and his misappropriation of investor funds, he allegedly misrepresented to investors that investors would receive management fees from the fund and a 20% share of fund's profits as compensation. In reality, as alleged in SEC Complaint No. 17(a)(1) and (3) thereunder, all of these representations were false and misleading. For example, while Tao solicited investments in PVC on their own and without the Registered Firm's knowledge or approval, his and other associates made material misrepresentations about the use of investors' funds and failed to timely or adequately disclose that he was investing in companies that had not raised as much money as anticipated. Finally, after a personal falling-out with Tao in 2013, Boyd stopped her involvement and did not disclose the investment in her own companies or the companies she owned or in which she had a significant stake.Â  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty and an officer-and-director bar. On December 5, 2017, Judge Paul G. Gottschall entered a final judgment ordering him to disgorge $2.5 million, plus $1.2 million in prejudicial interest and to be enjoined from future securities law violations, including Sections 206(1), 206 (2), and 207(4)-8 of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206a-8 and 206b-9 thereina, for violations of Section 15(i) of Securities Exchange Act Section 10(b).  The court's order also prohibits Tao from acting as an investment adviser and broker-dealer representative and from participating in securities offerings that are not subject to SEC registration or a court-ordered exemption from certain federal securities laws.

The SEC's complaint, filed on September 29, 2016, alleges that Accelera Innovations Inc.'s public filings included the revenues of a separate company that it did not own or control and, as a result, Accelera improperly inflated its annual revenue by up to 90 percent.

Geoffrey Thompson, Accelera's founder, allegedly signed Accelera's annual reports.

The SEC separately charged John Wallin, Accelera's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with signing certifications as to the accuracy of Accelera's Forms 10-K and 10-Q that falsely attested that he had reviewed Accelera's financial statements when he had not.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Wallin with aiding and abetting Accelera's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder and with violating Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act.

The judgment also provides that the amount of any civil penalty will be determined by the court at a future date.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC also separately charged Daniel Caravette, of St. Charles, Ill., with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  Caravette's alleged violations involved sales of stock in Accelera and a Canadian company founded by Thompson which claimed to be involved in medical marijuana production, distribution, infusion, research, and testing.  The SEC found that Caravette's transactions violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

Actual Summary:
On October 8, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Houston-based seismic data company, SAExploration Holdings Inc. (SAE), and four former executives for a multi-year accounting fraud that falsely inflated the company's revenue by approximately $100 million and concealed the theft of millions of dollars by the executives.  SAE issued restated financial statements in February and declared bankruptcy in August.  According to the SEC's complaint, starting in 2015, SAE, at the direction of the four executives - former CEO and Chairman Jeffrey Hastings, former CFO and General Counsel Brent Whiteley, former CEO and COO Brian Beatty, and former VP of Operations Michael Scott -entered into a series of seismic data acquisition contracts totaling approximately $140 million with a purportedly unrelated Alaska-based company that was in fact controlled by Hastings and Whiteley.  The complaint alleges that, of the amount SAE recorded in revenue, approximately $100 million was improperly recorded in light of the Alaskan company's inability to pay and the SAE executives' control of the company.  As alleged in the complaint, to create the false impression that the Alaskan company was actually paying SAE for seismic data, Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott misappropriated nearly $6 million from SAE and used the funds for a series of round trip transactions that caused the money to be sent back to SAE.  The complaint alleges that, in addition, the executives also stole a total of approximately $6 million for themselves.  The complaint further alleges that Whiteley separately misappropriated an additional $4 million through a fictitious invoice scheme.  The SEC's complaint charges SAE, Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  It further charges SAE with violating Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 thereunder, and that Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott aided and abetted those violations.  Additionally, the complaint charges Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott with violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Hastings, Whiteley, and Beatty with also violating Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-14, and 13b2-2.  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against SAE and permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bars against the four executives.  Additionally, the SEC seeks to have Hastings, Whiteley, and Beatty reimburse SAE for incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The complaint also charges Hastings's and Whiteley's spouses, Lori Hastings and Thomas O'Neill, as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Hastings.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Yael Berger, Peter Fielding, and Andrea Fox, and supervised by Stacy Bogert, Peter Rosario, and Jennifer Leete.  The litigation will be led by Nick Margida and supervised by Stephan Schlegelmilch.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Texas-based seismic data acquisition company SAExploration Holdings, Inc. ("SAE") and four former executives with fraudulently misappropriating approximately $100 million of revenue from transactions with a legitimate and unrelating customer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, SAE and its executives, Jeffrey H. Hastings, Brent N. Whiteley, and Brian A. Beatty, used fake invoices to conceal the fraud from SAE's board of directors and the investing public. The complaint further alleges that the defendants concealed the theft of the money from the customers and used it to pay for personal expenses and to fund a series of shell companies they controlled, including a shell company that purported to be owned by a third party, Alaskan Seismic Ventures, LLC ("ASV").  The SEC charges the four with violating the antifraud, record keeping, internal controls and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the anti-fraud and accounting provisions Section 13(d)(2)(A)(1)(B)(3)(C), and Rules 13a-14, 13d-1, 12d2-3, 14d1-4, 16d3-11, 15d13, 17d20, 18d21, 24d23, et al. (pp. 17) et seq., and SEC Rule 13b2(e) under the books and records and registration provision of Section 15(f)(5).  In addition, the complaint charges all four defendants with aiding and abetting each other's violations of these provisions and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar against each of them and, in a parallel action, enjoins them from future liability under Section 17(i) for their roles as officers and directors of public companies and from participating in any offering of oil or gas exploration tax credits offered by the company or a company affiliated with that company. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them of violating these charged provisions, ordering them to disgorge

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a former stockbroker accused of stealing investor money to remodel his house and pay other bills.   The SEC alleges that Bernard M. Parker raised more than $1.2 million from his longstanding brokerage customers and others who were told they were purchasing legitimate real estate tax lien certificates and would earn returns of six to nine percent annually. However, Parker only used a small amount of investor funds to purchase tax liens and instead used their money to remodel his home in Indiana, Pa., make car payments, and pay bills for his father-in-law.   In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Parker.   According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in Pittsburgh:    Parker conducted the unregistered and fraudulent offering from 2008 to 2014 through his company Parker Financial Services.  Parker was a registered representative associated with a dually-registered broker-dealer and investment advisory firm to which he did not disclose this side business.  Parker induced investors to purchase the securities by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions about his actual use of investor funds.  Parker told prospective investors that Parker Financial Services would use their funds to purchase tax liens placed by municipalities on properties primarily in Florida, Arizona, and Colorado. Parker pooled the money he raised from investors into several bank accounts, and when he cashed investors&rsquo; checks he routinely deposited a portion of the money into a bank account and took the remainder in cash.  Parker withdrew more than $650,000 in investor funds in cash from teller transactions, ATM withdrawals, and checks cashed at local supermarkets. He additionally spent approximately $197,000 of investor money in point-of-sale transactions, $150,000 through personal checks, and $169,000 for online bill payments.  Parker also made approximately $188,000 in purported interest payments to earlier investors in an effort to keep his scheme from being discovered.   The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Parker with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The SEC seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and penalties as well as a permanent injunction.   The SEC&rsquo;s continuing investigation is being conducted by Brian P. Thomas and Kelly L. Gibson in the Philadelphia office, and the litigation will be led by David L. Axelrod and Nuriye C. Uygur. The case is being supervised by G. Jeffrey Boujoukos. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
Generated Summary:
On November 23, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Pennsylvania man with conducting an unregistered offering of securities that raised more than $1.2 million from at least 22 investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from 2008 through 2014, Bernard M. Parker, a registered reprogator associated with a broker-dealer and investment adviser, induced investors to purchase investments in real estate tax liens, primarily those offered by municipalities in Florida, Arizona and Colorado. According to the complaint:  Parker told prospective investors that their funds would be used to buy tax lien certificates for municipal properties located in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and that Parker Financial Services would use the majority of the funds to make tax payments on the properties. In reality, Parker only used a small portion of investor funds for personal expenses, including a remodeling of his home, pay his father-in-law's medical bills, make interest payments to earlier investors and make a "tax-free" loan to an earlier investor. The complaint further alleges Parker used the vast majority to pay personal debts and, depending on municipality, penalties assessed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which is investigating Parker's alleged role in the scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint or in any other criminal proceeding the SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties and penny stock bars against Parker and his companies.Â The SEC also seeks a court-ordered injunction prohibiting Parker from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) thereunder, as well as an officer-and-director bar and a civil penalty. Investors can also apply for a temporary restraining order, an accounting of any assets that may have been obtained from the alleged fraud, or a preliminary injunction against future violations of these provisions.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers - including many elderly retirees and unsophisticated investors - out of more than $2.7 million in a multi-year investment scam.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2014 through 2016, Ernest J. Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC.  Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments.  Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked.  Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false.  As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit.  He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Romer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Wilburn Saylor of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Steven Klawans.  The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Ms. Key-Patterson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Macomb County, Michigan Prosecutor's Office.
Generated Summary:
On September 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Shelby Township, Michigan resident with defrauding his retail brokerage customers out of approximately $2.7 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that, from approximately 2014 to 2016, Ernest J. Romer, III, a registered representative associated with CoreCap Investments, LLC, persuaded at least 30 of his customers to sell securities in their accounts and transfer their proceeds to either P&R Capital, LP or Core Cap Solutions, for a total of $4.4 million, including $714,000 to cover his personal expenses, and $41,500 to family members. According to the SEC, in exchange for his assistance in this fraud, he would invest their money in a stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments. The complaint further alleges, however, that he did not invest the customers' funds for their benefit. Instead, Romers commingled the customer funds and used the money to repay other customers at his brokerage firms, who had suffered losses from a private offering in 2010 and 2011. As alleged, most of the victims were retirees and unsophisticated investors who were not invested in corecap investments and were more likely to lose money due to their retirement savings. In addition, some customers received Ponzi-like payments, using money he received from his victims. Some customers transferred funds to others for personal purposes, such as credit card bills and shopping, college costs, or college tuition. Finally, one customer allegedly sent a check to his family for her son.Â  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Birkenheier and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. This case has been approved by the Commission. For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) (Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against recidivist James K. McKillop for acting as an unregistered broker and for failing to timely file required beneficial ownership forms in connection with his position at Tiber Creek Corp.  The SEC also separately filed related settled administrative charges against Tiber Creek and Tiber Creek's president, James M. Cassidy.  According to the SEC's complaint and the SEC's order, Tiber Creek maintained an inventory of SEC-registered public shell companies, for which McKillop and Cassidy served as the officers, directors, and fifty percent shareholders.  The SEC alleges that since July 2012, McKillop and Cassidy effected securities transactions through Tiber Creek for more than 100 public shell companies without being registered as brokers.  The complaint also alleges that on more than 110 occasions, McKillop and Cassidy failed to timely file required beneficial ownership reports, including Schedules 13G and Forms 4, in connection with the public shell companies.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, McKillop has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the reporting, registration, and beneficial ownership disclosure provisions of Sections 13(d), 15(a), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $117,000, plus interest of $17,697, and a civil penalty of $75,000, and imposing a penny stock bar.  Based on the allegations in the complaint, the SEC also filed an application seeking to enforce an administrative cease-and-desist order instituted against McKillop in 2000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the application, McKillop has also consented to a district court order requiring him to comply with the cease-and-desist order.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Tiber Creek and Cassidy consented to the entry of the SEC's order, which finds that Tiber Creek and Cassidy violated the registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and that Cassidy violated the reporting and beneficial ownership disclosure provisions of Section 13(d) and Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16a-3 thereunder. The SEC's order requires Tiber Creek and Cassidy to pay, jointly and severally, $117,000 in disgorgement, $17,697 in prejudgment interest, and $75,000 in civil penalties, and imposes cease and desist orders, and associational and permanent penny stock bars.  Cassidy also agreed to be permanently suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order prohibits Cassidy from representing clients in SEC matters, including investigations, litigation, or examinations, and from advising clients about SEC filing obligations or content.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Matt Reilly and supervised by Kevin Guerrero and Antonia Chion.

Generated Summary:
On March 26, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Beverly Hills, California-based registered broker with failing to timely file required beneficial ownership disclosure forms for more than one hundred public shell companies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, charges James K. McKillop, of Los Angeles, with violating the registration provisions of Sections 13(a), 15(c), and 21(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13d-1, 16a-2, and 16e-3 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, since at least July 2012, McKilling and his business associate James M. Cassidy assisted private operating companies in going public with the company, Tiber Creek, solicited private companies and charged them a fee for providing services that resulted in a private company gaining control of one of those public shells. As alleged, however, as a result of these transactions, some of McKilk's shares became worthless and he failed to file timely reports on Schedule 13G as required to disclose his ownership of a public company. In addition, on more occasions, McKilling did not file his required reports. Finally, in September 2015, when he became aware of an SEC investigation that was ongoing, he filed a Form 10-Q filed under seal for his participation in an unregistered broker-dealer, which was subject to the Commission's order to cease and desist from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal, or municipal securities dealer in violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, Killing has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000, plus a $1 million officer-and-director bar and an $8,500 officer and director bar.Â The settlement is pending final approval by the court.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged two California men and their investment firm with operating a Ponzi scheme as they purported to specialize in serving middle-class investors and securing exorbitant returns by investing in hot pre-IPO stocks. The agency also obtained a court-ordered asset freeze against them.  The SEC alleges that instead of using the firm's purported proprietary trading models and investing in pre-IPO shares of well-known tech companies like Uber, Alibaba, and Airbnb as promised to investors, Jaswant "Jason" Gill and Javier Rios personally pocketed at least $2.8 million in investor funds, using some of that money to pay for excursions to high-end restaurants and luxury retail stores as well as jaunts to Las Vegas casinos, gentlemen's clubs, and professional sporting events. They never actually invested in any pre-IPO shares, and have been using money from new investors to pay supposed returns to earlier investors. They have raised approximately $10 million through their firm, JSG Capital Investments, and related entities, by catering to average retail investors and promising them exclusive investment opportunities "previously only available to the one-percenters," with guaranteed annual returns of up to 60 percent.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Gill in particular has brandished phony credentials, telling investors he founded his firm after serving as a managing director at Morgan Stanley. He also boasted partnerships with several Silicon Valley venture capital firms. Gill, Rios, and JSG Capital Investments are not registered with the SEC or any state regulator. Rios's background is in food service.  Investors can quickly and easily check the credentials of people selling investments and determine whether they are registered by using the SEC's investor.gov website.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Gill and Rios.  The SEC's complaint charges Gill, Rios, JSG Capital Investments, LLC, JSG Capital LLC, JSG Capital, LLC and JSG Enterprises LLC with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Gill and JSG Capital Investments, LLC with violations of Section 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint also names JSG Management Group, LLC as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten gains from the scheme.  The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions plus disgorgement and monetary penalties from Gill, Rios, JSG Capital Investments and related entities. The SEC has obtained a court order to freeze the assets of Gill, Rios, and the JSG entities and preliminarily enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and raising money from investors.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ruth Hawley and John Roscigno and supervised by Jeremy Pendrey of the San Francisco office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Jason Habermeyer, Andrew Hefty, and Ms. Hawley.

Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a San Francisco-based investment firm and its founder with conducting a Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 200 retail investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jaswant Gill and Javier Rios raised approximately $10 million from nearly 200 investors between September 2013 and September 2014, promising guaranteed, fixed returns of up to 60 percent annually through purported investments in highly coveted, pre-IPO shares of companies such as Airbnb, Alibaba, and Uber. The complaint alleges that the defendants used investor money to pay for vacations to high-end restaurants and clubs, jaunts to Las Vegas casinos, gentlemen's clubs and luxury retail stores, as well as to make payments to earlier investors in the scheme. In reality, the Defendants falsely portrayed themselves as a "man-and-an-a-woman" investing in these investments, claiming that investor funds were secured by assets held at established brokerage firms and that investors were additionally secured against losses by an insurance policy. As alleged, these claims were false and misleading. For example, Gill has received at least $1.7 million in cash withdrawals, transfers to his personal bank account and the monthly rent at his own residence, while using over $500,000 in interest payments from a JSG Capital Investments, LLC investment advisory firm. Gill used additional funds for personal expenses and purchases at retailers for furniture and clothing. Finally, he allegedly used an expense account he created to repay earlier victims of the fraud to cover his lifestyle and pay earlier investor payments. Without admitting or denying the allegations, J.Rios and Gill have agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1)(A), 206 (2)(B), and 214(3)(C) in connection with the same securities offering and investment adviser previously charged by the Commission in a parallel action, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, on May 25, 2016.Â  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, a penny stock bar, an officer and director bar against Gill, joint and severally liable for any civil monetary relief.

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action on August 12, 2019 in federal court in Springfield, Massachusetts, charging investment adviser Richard G. Duncan, a resident of East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, with defrauding two advisory clients who were retail investors by persuading them to invest over $300,000 in an apparent scam originating in Turkey.  According to the Commission's complaint, Duncan violated his fiduciary duty as an investment adviser by ignoring, and failing to disclose, warnings from two banks that the Turkish investment opportunity was probably a scam.  Duncan also made materially false and misleading statements to at least one client, promising as much as a 100% return on the Turkish investment.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Duncan violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Duncan.  The Commission's case is being handled by Susan Cooke Anderson, Frank Huntington, John McCann, and Michele T. Perillo of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Kamran Beikmohamadi, John Kachmor, Josh Grinspoon, and Melissa Clough of the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations in the Boston office, who conducted a related examination.
Generated Summary:
On August 12, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Longmeadow, Massachusetts-based investment adviser with defrauding his advisory clients in a purported Turkish investment opportunity that was actually a scam.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that from late 2016 until the fall of 2018, Richard C. Duncan solicited investments in an opportunity in Turkey that he described as a "tragedy."  Duncan allegedly told his clients that a woman who had defected to Turkey would be able to manage the $6 million estate of her father, and that she would receive a 100% return on her investment if she helped secure the release of the money. The complaint alleges, however, that Duncan failed to obtain any documentation establishing the woman's identity, confirming the existence of legal proceedings involving the estate, or confirming any financial interest that Client #1 would receive in her estate. In addition, as alleged, Duncan did not disclose to clients he had been warned by two banks that the investment was probably a fraudulent scam, despite repeated warnings from one of his long-time advisers that it was likely a fraud. Finally, according to the SEC, when Duncan returned to his home in Massachusetts to settle a pending divorce case, he told several people who were supposedly helping him with the issue of a fake estate and told them he would wire $10,000 to help them with their settlement. He also failed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to provide documentation that corroborated the financial information he received from the two bank personnel who warned him about the potential fraud, including warning that two people had warned Duncan about a potential investment scam and warning him of potential financial losses if he sent more than $1 million in investor funds into a bank account that belonged to a foreign attorney or to another investor. According to court records, in addition to failing to disclose his conflict of interest to client #2 when he provided the advice, at the expense of clients, of whom he owed over $2.5 million, a total of $28,100 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest of about $3,500, from Duncan's brokerage account in Texas. To settle his father's estate without disclosing the alleged fraud in his name and without providing any evidence of any potential loss of investor money, both Duncan and his law firm agreed to permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 206(1) and (2) of

Actual Summary: 
Two former executives of Indiana-based plastics manufacturer Lucent Polymers, Inc., who are defendants in ongoing SEC litigation, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana.  On June 18, 2020, Jason Jimerson, Lucent's former COO, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud, one count of money laundering, and one count of making false statements to federal agents.  On July 28, 2020, Kevin R. Kuhnash, Lucent's former CEO, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud and one count of money laundering.  The SEC previously charged Kuhnash and Jimerson on February 12, 2019 for their roles in a scheme to conceal that Lucent's core business model was a sham in connection with the company's acquisition in 2013.  According to the SEC's complaint, Lucent routinely lied to its customers and falsified its certifications of test data to show that its products complied with customer specifications, including on important aspects such as fire-retardant measures.  Kuhnash and Jimerson allegedly hid Lucent's fraudulent practices, made misrepresentations to the company that acquired Lucent, and continued the fraud even after the sale of the business to secure future payments.  The SEC's litigation, which was stayed pending resolution of the criminal action, continues.  The SEC's complaint charges Kuhnash and Jimerson with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, and officer-and-director bars.
Generated Summary:
On February 12, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against two former executives of an Indiana-based plastics manufacturing company.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Kevin R. Kuhnash and Jason J. Jimerson, respectively the former CEO and former COO of Lucent Polymers Inc., misled customers about the company's purported ability to turn "garbage to gold" into high-quality plastics that met customer specifications. The complaint further alleges, as alleged, that the defendants lied to investors about their own equity stakes and misrepresented to customers that their investments would be rewarded with returns of up to 20% per year. In reality, Kuhnaash, Jimanderson's companies were not profitable because they did not disclose their fraud to potential buyers. Instead, they sold their equity in a stock that was not registered with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the alleged fraud. According to the complaint filed in federal court in Evansville, Indiana, between 2007 and 2013, LuCent, a privately-held plastics manufacturer based in Ohio, and its former Chief Operating Officer, Jason P. Jeffries, were fraudulently falsifying test results to fool potential customers into believing that it was a successful business. As a result of this conduct, Lehmann's stock price increased and he sold his remaining equity stake in his company to Citadel Plastics Holdings, LLC, for a profit of more than $1.3 million. After the SEC investigation was conducted, however, it became increasingly apparent that Lehman's fraud was real and that he was hiding it from investors by making material misrepresentations to conceal his fraud and by scheming to hide the fraud from the public. For example, in one instance, when a customer ordered a plastic to replace an old product with a newer one, he allegedly sent the customer a fake test result that showed that his product had "failed" to meet certain specifications, even though the test had been performed. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, Hendelman agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 17(a) and (b)(5)(B)(2)(A).

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against an Australia-based investment adviser Goldsky Asset Management, LLC and its owner, Kenneth Grace, for making false and misleading statements about its business in filings with the Commission and on its website.  According to the SEC's complaint, Goldsky's Forms ADV filed with the Commission in 2016 and 2017, which Grace signed, stated that its hedge fund, Goldsky Global Alpha Fund, LP, had an auditor, a prime broker and custodian, and an administrator.  In addition, in its Forms ADV and Forms ADV Part 2A, Goldsky stated that it managed over $100 million in discretionary assets under management.  Goldsky's website also claimed that Goldsky Fund earned: 19.45% compounded annual returns since inception, 70.33% compounded monthly returns since inception, and 25.30% returns for the year ended September 30, 2017.  The SEC alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Goldsky, Grace and Goldsky Fund had no agreements with service providers, Goldsky and Grace did not manage $100 million of assets, and Goldsky Fund did not have any investment returns as it never had any assets.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Goldsky and Grace with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, or in the alternative, that Grace aided and abetted Goldsky's violations.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering permanent injunctive relief and civil monetary penalties against Goldsky and Grace.  The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Gerald Gross, James Hanson, and Jorge G. Tenreiro of the New York Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Tenreiro, and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.Â  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in this matter.

On September 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging a former investment adviser with acting as an unregistered broker.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2014 to 2016, Robert C. Hannan, Jr., a co-founder and owner of a now-defunct investment advisory firm, made false and misleading statements to investors in connection with the use of the firm's funds.Â  According to the complaint:  Hannanan was a self-described "banker" and "trader" who used his clients' money to fund personal expenses, such as travel expenses and credit card bills, to support his lavish lifestyle and to pay for his personal travel and living expenses. The complaint also alleged that Hanan was the sole owner and control person behind the scheme, and that he was not a registered broker-dealer or a member of any registered investment advisor. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this matter, Hannahan consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provision of Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4), of which the judgment further enjoins Hannigan from participating in any future offering of securities, including offering to purchase, selling, or trading in a public company for a profit in excess of $100,000, a year after the date of his initial public offering, on which he agreed to settle the charges and pay a $1.2 million civil penalty, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by a federal district court. In a parallel criminal case, Judge Donnelly entered a final judgment on September 26, 2020, ordering Hannagan to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, impose civil penalties of up to $150,500 and impose an officer-and-director bar, with disgorgement amounting to approximately $2.5 million. On October 2, 2019, he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He has also been barred from associating with any broker, dealer dealer, municipal securities dealer or nationally recognized statistical rating

The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid falsely claimed that certain individuals accompanied him to dinners to make it appear various personal expenses had a business purpose, and he doctored a receipt in an effort to justify his purchase of a $3,500 suit for his father as a business expense.  According to the SEC's complaint, despite being caught by the firm and told to stop on two occasions in 2010 and 2012, Rashid continued to expense personal items to clients into 2013.Â  After he was confronted about his expenses for a third time, Rashid admitted that he charged approximately $220,000 in personal expenses.Â  A forensic accountant then uncovered additional personal expenses that Rashid improperly charged to clients.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid violated, and in the alternative aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks penalties and injunctive relief.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday announced charges against a Louisiana man for orchestrating a foreign currency trading scheme that defrauded at least 28 investors, most of whom are from the Baton Rouge area.  The SEC alleges that Todd W. Mixon, a Baton Rouge resident with no known financial industry experience, raised at least $576,000 by misrepresenting to investors that he had learned how to successfully trade foreign currencies and by promising investors that he would use their funds to trade foreign currencies. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Mixon provided investors with forged brokerage statements to create the illusion that Mixon's trading was extraordinarily profitable, achieving consistent monthly profits as high as 160%. In reality, as alleged, Mixon did not use investor funds to trade foreign currencies as he had promised to do, but rather spent those funds on personal travel and other expenses and to make Ponzi-like payments to investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisiana, charges Mixon with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Alexander Charap and Kathleen Strandell in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Jessica M. Weissman and Glenn S. Gordon. The SEC's litigation is being led by Andrew Schiff.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sacramento, California-based investment adviser firm Springer Investment Management, Inc. dba Springer Financial Advisors (SFA) and owner Keith Springer with defrauding hundreds of retail clients, most of them in or close to retirement.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Springer and SFA received millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation and other benefits for recommending certain investment products while claiming that they did not have any conflicts of interest. According to the complaint, many clients learned of Springer through his radio show, "Smart Money with Keith Springer," and Springer misled prospective clients into believing he was selected to host the show because of his industry expertise. In reality, SFA paid to broadcast the show. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Springer went to great lengths to hide prior charges by the SEC and his disciplinary history with the New York Stock Exchange, hiring internet search suppression consultants and instructing employees not to provide the information to prospective clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, charges Keith Springer with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act").

Generated Summary:
On December 19, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Sacramento-based investment adviser firm and its principal, Keith Springer, with defrauding retirees and near-retirees by making false and misleading representations to clients and prospective clients about Springer's compensation, conflicts of interest, and credentials.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, alleges that Springer and his firm, Springer Investment Management, Inc. ("Springs"), solicited retirees to recommend or direct their clients into investments in fixed indexed annuities, including recommending that clients buy securities in existing retirement accounts to fund an annuity and pay the associated surrender fee to a third party. The complaint further alleges Springer directed SFA employees to create versions of the articles that made it appear as if they were published work, rather than advertisements. In reality, they received no compensation for their services and were not compensated for any of their investment advice. Springer also allegedly received payments from insurance companies for selling a certain target number of clients' individual client assets. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint:   In a series of advertisements that were distributed on the internet and social media platforms, defendants allegedly told clients that they would receive a fee of 0.35% of a client's assets under management, which resulted in higher fees for Springer.Â  The advertisements also falsely claimed that the clients would "never receive any incentives to use an investment in our client portfolios" when in fact they did receive an incentive to buy investments based on their stated goals and risk tolerance.&nbsp;  As alleged, however, none of these claims were true and defendants received more than $6 million in compensation from the sale of securities than the recommended investment recommendations they recommended to their client, a total of over $7.5 million, of which $2.2 million was used to pay for a private hedge fund they managed and a $1.3 million investment advisory fee for its advisory clients. Investors were also told that their funds would be used only after they became new clients, not after the client had retained them as investment advisers. Some investors were even encouraged to send money to Springer as a thank-you to those who had recommended or recommended them to invest in their particular investments.

Generated Summary:
On August 18, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Cecilia Millan and Margarita Cabrera, two promoters of AirBit Club, a multi-level marketing scheme that targeted Latinx and Spanish-speaking communities with promises of high returns from algorithmic digital asset trading and from "automated robots" connected to "international exchanges."  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from at least August 2016 through November 2017, Mill and Cabrera raised approximately $1.4 million from investors who were lured to the scheme by the promise of returns of up to 60% from the initial investment of an investment.  In reality, as alleged, these investors were not registered as brokers and received substantial compensation from Airbit for selling the investment in its products and services, and the promoters received no compensation for their promotion and sales of the investments in connection with their marketing efforts. The complaint further alleges, in a promotional video posted to social media, that the defendants each solicited new investors through a network of online recruitment efforts, including YouTube videos and investment presentations.Â  The defendants' promotional efforts were in both Spanish and English and targeted the Latino and Latino communities for investment and retail investors, who often relied on the recruitment of others to fund their investment plans and to reap significant profits from selling their investments. In a parallel action the U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern California today announced criminal charges against the two defendants, charging them with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 15(b)(2).  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $10,000 and a civil penalty of over $600,00, which is equal to disgorge the amount of allegedly ill-gotten gains received in their respective criminal cases. On the same day the SEC issued an enforcement order, it issued a cease-and-desist order and issued the asset freeze order. This order also imposed a temporary restraining order prohibiting the three defendants from participating in any marketing or sales activity, imposes an officer and director bar on each defendant and imposes a penny stock bar against each of them and prohibits the entry of any new investor or investment adviser.
