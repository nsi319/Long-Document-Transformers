The resolution follows several days of a vigorously contested hearing regarding the control and management of Woodbridge while it is in bankruptcy. During the hearing, the SEC presented substantial evidence of fraud committed by Woodbridge prior to filing for bankruptcy.  In a hearing yesterday, the Honorable Judge Kevin J. Carey of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved a settlement Term Sheet presented by the SEC, the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, and Ad Hoc Committees of Unitholders and Noteholders. Among other things, the settlement provides for the appointment of a New Board of Managers consisting of representatives recommended by the parties which will take necessary actions for managing Woodbridge. The settlement also provides for the SEC's consent, not unreasonably withheld, to the retention of a CEO or Chief Restructuring Officer, and the selection of Debtors' professionals.  Judge Carey's Order approving the Term Sheet stated that the resolution is in the best interest of the Creditors, the Committee, the Debtors, their estates, and other parties in interest, and provided the appointment of a New Board of Managers, which will select a CEO or Chief Restructuring Officer for the Debtors. In furtherance of the settlement, the SEC has agreed to dismiss its request in the District Court action for the appointment of a receiver over the Debtors and related entities.  According to the Term Sheet attached to the Order, all parties will also cooperate in facilitating non-debtor entities, subject to the asset freeze by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, to come under control of the New Board and under jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court administering the Woodbridge Chapter 11 cases.

1,"On August 12, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Longmeadow, Massachusetts-based investment adviser with defrauding his advisory clients in a purported Turkish investment opportunity that was actually a scam.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that from late 2016 until the fall of 2018, Richard C. Duncan solicited investments in an opportunity in Turkey that he described as a ""tragedy.""  Duncan allegedly told his clients that a woman who had defected to Turkey would be able to manage the $6 million estate of her father, and that she would receive a 100% return on her investment if she helped secure the release of the money. The complaint alleges, however, that Duncan failed to obtain any documentation establishing the woman's identity, confirming the existence of legal proceedings involving the estate, or confirming any financial interest that Client #1 would receive in her estate. In addition, as alleged, Duncan did not disclose to clients he had been warned by two banks that the investment was probably a fraudulent scam, despite repeated warnings from one of his long-time advisers that it was likely a fraud. Finally, according to the SEC, when Duncan returned to his home in Massachusetts to settle a pending divorce case, he told several people who were supposedly helping him with the issue of a fake estate and told them he would wire $10,000 to help them with their settlement. He also failed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to provide documentation that corroborated the financial information he received from the two bank personnel who warned him about the potential fraud, including warning that two people had warned Duncan about a potential investment scam and warning him of potential financial losses if he sent more than $1 million in investor funds into a bank account that belonged to a foreign attorney or to another investor. According to court records, in addition to failing to disclose his conflict of interest to client #2 when he provided the advice, at the expense of clients, of whom he owed over $2.5 million, a total of $28,100 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest of about $3,500, from Duncan's brokerage account in Texas. To settle his father's estate without disclosing the alleged fraud in his name and without providing any evidence of any potential loss of investor money, both Duncan and his law firm agreed to permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 206(1) and (2) of","The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an enforcement action on August 12, 2019 in federal court in Springfield, Massachusetts, charging investment adviser Richard G. Duncan, a resident of East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, with defrauding two advisory clients who were retail investors by persuading them to invest over $300,000 in an apparent scam originating in Turkey.  According to the Commission's complaint, Duncan violated his fiduciary duty as an investment adviser by ignoring, and failing to disclose, warnings from two banks that the Turkish investment opportunity was probably a scam.  Duncan also made materially false and misleading statements to at least one client, promising as much as a 100% return on the Turkish investment.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Duncan violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Duncan.

2,"On September 30, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dennis F. Wright, a stockbroker and investment advisor entrusted with handling his customers' retirement funds, with stealing over $1.5 million from at least 28 retail investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, from February 1998 until June 2012, Wright engaged in a fraudulent scheme to lure customers to withdraw funds from their existing AXA variable annuities accounts with the false promise that they would invest those funds in an ""AXA managed account"" that purportedly invested in mutual funds and yielded higher returns than their variable mutual fund investments. The complaint alleges that Wright never invested the funds as promised and instead deposited the stolen funds into a bank account that he controlled, under the name Wright Associates, and used the money to pay personal expenses as well as pay other customers who demanded withdrawals. In addition, as alleged in the complaint Wright concealed his fraud by creating and providing false and misleading account statements and other deceptive practices, such as providing falsified account information and fabricated account values. For instance, for example, in August 2007, when Wright recommended that one customer invest $270,000 through a variable investment account with an appreciating account value of $11,875, he allegedly forged a fake account statement and falsely claimed that the account held shares of a mutual mutual investment with a higher rate of return. As alleged, however, this account was a fiction created by Wright to induce customers into transferring funds using non-existent accounts that were not registered with him. Rather than invest the allegedly ill-gotten gains with Wright's customers, they transferred the invested principal into the fictitious account and stole the remaining balance. Finally, on or about June 2013, after Wright resigned from his position as an investment adviser at a Pennsylvania-based broker-dealer, W.C. Financial Services, Inc. (""WCFSA""), he created and provided fabricated accounts for the purported managed accounts, which he used to make unauthorized withdrawals from the brokerage account. He also allegedly provided customers with false account balances that falsely represented that their funds were invested as expected. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission's complaints, Mr. Kase has consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 17(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to disgorge $92,734.62 plus prejudgment","On September 30, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dennis F. Wright, a former registered representative based in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, with defrauding his customers by stealing their funds for his personal use and falsifying their account statements to cover up his fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Wright misappropriated more than $1.5 million from at least 28 customers.  Wright fraudulently induced his customers to redeem securities held in their securities accounts, including variable annuities and mutual funds, by falsely representing that he would invest the proceeds from the redemptions in a managed account that held other securities that yielded higher returns than their existing securities accounts.  Instead, Wright deposited his customers' funds in a bank account he controlled and from which he misappropriated the funds in order to pay his personal expenses as well as to fund customer withdrawals.  Wright concealed his fraud by providing his customers with falsified account statements purportedly showing that they had purchased and owned interests in the non-existent managed accounts with appreciating balances.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against Wright.  Wright has agreed to settle the SEC's charges and disgorge his ill-gotten gains, which will be deemed satisfied by the entry of an order of restitution in the criminal case.  He also consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  As part of the settlement, and following the entry of the proposed final judgment, Wright has consented to the entry of a Commission order, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6) and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, permanently barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization; and barring him from participating in any offering of a penny stock.

3,"On June 10, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged four shell companies for conducting unregistered sales of penny stock in the United States without registering the securities with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Caledonian Bank Ltd. (""Caledonia""), Clear Water Securities, Inc., and Verdmont Capital, S.A. (collectively, ""Verdmont""), sold the stock for the account of one or more of three customers in Belize, Mexico, Norway, and Jamaica when no bona fide sales took place. The complaint further alleges the defendants engaged in fraudulent registration statements on Form S-1 that purported to register penny stocks to public shareholders when, in reality, they were selling stock that was virtually worthless and whose prices fell to their former token levels within months of the issuers' sales. According to the complaint, these sales generated more than $75 million in proceeds on the accounts of customers who were not affiliated with those companies and received commissions of $239,965 in commissions for those sales, which were distributed to retail investors. In addition, as alleged, all the sales proceeds were allegedly used to pay for personal expenses, including a mortgage and a car dealership, for a total of about $1.3 million. As set forth in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York on June 11, 2016, Calreedonian and Clearwater were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5(a) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the broker-dealer registration requirements. Calredonian was charged as an additional defendant in this action and was ordered to disgorge its profits with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of over $100,000. Both defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in their respective SEC filings, with each of them paying disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties and permanent injunctive relief. Among other things:  Calcedonian, ClearWater, Nautilus Growth Fund Inc. and Bartlett Trading Inc.'s stock certificates were issued to foreign shareholders without being registered as a public company, without the companies having registered to sell their securities, or without a valid exemption from registration for their offers and sales and without having any basis for selling their shares in public markets. On September 15, 2014, a federal district court in Miami, Florida entered a","On July 31, 2017, the Honorable Judge Willian H. Pauley III of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments by default against Belize-based, Clear Water Securities, Inc. (""Clear Water"") and Legacy Global Markets S.A. (""Legacy Global"") and, on April 7, 2017, entered final judgment by default against Panama-based, Verdmont Capital S.A. (""Verdmont"").  Earlier, on November 9, 2016, as part of a settlement, Judge Pauley entered a final judgement against Cayman Islands-based, Caledonian Bank Ltd. and Caledonian Securities Ltd. (""Caledonian Entities"").  The SEC charged these defendants with conducting unregistered sales of penny stock securities, reaping over $75 million in illegal sales proceeds.   Simultaneously with filing its complaint, the SEC obtained an emergency court order freezing assets of the Defendants located in the United States.  The defendants, as alleged, sold penny stocks in unregistered distributions from their U.S. brokerage accounts of four shell company issuers, namely, Swingplane Ventures, Inc., Goff Corp., Norstra Energy Inc. and Xumanii, Inc.  Each of the unregistered distributions took place through virtually the same scheme.  The issuers first filed with the Commission bogus Form S-1 registration statements that purported to register public offerings of securities when, in fact, no bona fide offerings or sales occurred because the securities purportedly sold remained in the control of the issuers and their affiliates.  In the sham offerings, the issuers pretended to sell securities to investors residing in such places as Serbia, Mexico, Ireland, Norway, Panama, and Jamaica, while the issuers or their affiliates maintained control and possession of the stock certificates in a scheme where:  (1) restricted stock was passed off as ""free trading"" unrestricted stock; (2) the share certificates issued were subsequently transferred, without restrictive legends, to the defendants; and (3) the defendants deposited the shares into their U.S. brokerage accounts and sold the shares to the public.  The defendants then offered and sold into the public markets hundreds of millions of shares of the four issuers in unregistered distributions simultaneously with aggressive and extensive promotion campaigns.  Each of the four stocks lost virtually all of its market value within months of the unregistered sales.  The court entered a final judgment against the Caledonian Entities imposing permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and a penny stock bar permanently barring them from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  The judgment further found the Caledonian Entities liable on a joint and several basis in the amount of $25 million, but payment for this amount was waived based on liquidation proceedings filed in the U.S. and the Cayman Islands.  With regard to Verdmont, the court entered a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act and a permanent penny stock bar.  The final judgment also ordered Verdmont to pay $19.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $19.2 million.  In a separate order, the court directed certain funds that were the subject of the SEC's prior asset freeze to be turned over to the SEC.  The court also entered final judgments against Clear Water and Legacy Global imposing permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act and permanent penny stock bars and ordering monetary relief in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties of over $17.3 million and $14.9 million, respectively.

According to the SEC's complaint, in April 2016, before a scheduled earnings announcement and earnings conference call, Matthew and Susan Brunstromum learned material non-public information about the company's poor first quarter financial results, which were announced on April 28, 2016. The SEC alleges that, based on this information and his subsequent trading in advance of the earnings release and subsequent blackout periods, they traded on the information, realizing profits of $159,904. On the morning of April 29, 2017, after the announcement was made public, and shortly before the blackout period began, Matt BrunStrum allegedly used this material information to encourage his mother to trade on his behalf. As a result of his trading, he avoided a loss of over $170,000. In a parallel action, on July 21, 2019, U.S. District Judge Amy C. Donnelly in the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, as well as a civil penalty for a further five years, for further determination by the court upon which the matter is being handled. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this matter, Mr. Brunstum agreed to settle the charges by consenting to entry of a judgment that imposes permanent injunctions, imposes civil penalties and orders him be enjoined from future securities law violations and ordered to disgorge $157,252 in illusory monetary gains, pay a $1,038 penalty and pay an officer and director bar of approximately $165,794. Finally, by agreeing not to participate in any future offering or sale of any securities, both he and the defendant have consented to a permanent injunction and to an order prohibiting them from participating in future offerings or sales of securities. Both defendants have also agreed, subject to court approval, to be barred from serving as broker-dealers or penny stock traders, from purchasing or selling any security and from acting as independent brokers or broker dealers.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that in April 2016, Matthew Brunstrum learned through his job that Stericycle's first quarter 2016 financial results would be much worse than had been expected and used this material non-public information to trade in Stericycle securities in advance of the company's upcoming April 28, 2016 earnings announcement.  The complaint also alleges that Matthew Brunstrum disclosed Stericycle's earnings information to his mother who traded on that information.  Stericycle's stock fell by $26.18 the day after Stericycle announced its first quarter financial results, losing almost 22 percent of its value.  The SEC's complaint alleges that as a result of their illegal trading, Matthew Brunstrum avoided losses and earned profits in the amount of $159,904, and Susan Brunstrum avoided losses and earned profits in the amount of $170,252.

According to the complaint:Gilman allegedly spent substantially all of the money he raised on personal expenses, such as luxury Las Vegas hotel stays, designer clothing and home furnishings, and a Ponzi payment to an earlier investor.

In reality, according to his internet biography and other materials filed with the SEC in federal district court in Dallas, none of these items were true. GilMan allegedly used a portion of investor funds to fund his personal expenditures, including designer clothes, travel and dining, rent, entertainment, casino ATMs and cash withdrawals at casino resorts, as well as to pay for personal travel, luxury entertainment and entertainment expenses and to support his business ventures.

Threshie, Jr., of Wilton, Connecticut, raised almost $582,000 from at least 94 investors by offering and selling securities in Tirex, a company that markets a purported tire recycling system.  According to the complaint, Threshie regularly emailed existing investors describing Tirex's marketing activity and, in some instances, encouraging the investors to invest more money and asking them to share his invitation to purchase stock with anyone who might be interested in investing.  No registration statement was on file or in effect with the SEC with respect to this offering of securities, as required by the applicable securities laws.  The SEC suspended trading in Tirex securities on November 12, 2015.  Prior to the trading suspension, Tirex securities were quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.  The SEC's complaint charges Threshie with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Threshie consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctions and a penny stock bar and requiring him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $722,281.60 and a civil penalty of $50,000.

According to the SEC's complaint, between February and August 2016, the company bought at least 559,662 downloads from outside marketing firms to boost the profile of the company's mobile app, SELFEO.Â These firms provided Giga with a shortcut to propel its app to the top of the Apple Store download rankings. But instead of disclosing the real cause of the app's artificial meteoric rise, the company misled its shareholders into believing that this success was due to traditional marketing tactics like billboards and radio advertisements.Â The complaint alleges that when the company stopped paying for downloads in August 2016, the app's rankings on the Apple Store plummeted.Â Rather than come clean about the fact that the spike in downloads was a result of paid download campaigns, the company, Nerlinger, Streiner, and Colucci lied and told shareholders that the number of downloads continued to grow at the same high rate. Further, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, and Noska lied and falsified documents to conceal Nerlinger's role as Giga'sÂ de factoÂ CEO to prevent the investors from discovering his prior criminal conviction for mail fraud.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, charges: (i)Â Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Noska with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Streiner with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and aiding and abetting Giga's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; and (iv) Giga with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, Noska, and Streiner consented to the entry of an SEC order finding that they violated the antifraud provisions, and a finding that Giga violated registration provisions of the federal securities laws.Â Colucci and Noska each agreed to a $25,000 penalty, and Streiner agreed to a $15,000 penalty. In addition, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci each agreed to a permanent officer and director bar, and Streiner agreed to a five-year bar. The settlements are subject to court approval.

The complaint alleges, however, that this scheme was a fraudulent one, as the money was used to repay a debt owed to the real GroupM and to pay himself and his wife over $350,000 to settle a legal dispute and spend about $107,500 on home furnishings and remodeling.

11,"On February 20, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Michael Scott Williams and two entities he controls, Kinetic Investment Group, LLC and KIH, Inc. (collectively, ""Kinetic Funds"").  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2013 to 2019, Williams, a San Juan, Puerto Rico resident, and his entities, KIC Investments Group LLC d/b/a Lendacy Financial Services LLC (KIC), raised approximately $39 million from more than 30 investors in an unregistered securities offering.  The complaint alleges that Williams solicited investors to invest in a purported hedge fund with a sub-fund structure that he managed, which he touted as a ""loan"" that would be hedged by listed financial products, but was not listed on a U.S. exchange nor was it a publicly traded company. The SEC alleges, among other things, that the defendants misappropriated investor funds to fund other business ventures and to pay for Williams' personal expenses, including a mortgage on his relative's home and a multi-day event at a luxury hotel in the resort resort town of San Diego, Florida. In addition, as alleged, in one of the complaints filed in federal court in Florida, defendants misrepresented to investors that their funds were being secured by ""kints"" and ""joint ventures,"" and that they had access to information about KFY's liquidity and the use of collateral. As a result of these misrepresentations, investors were left with little or no information on how their money would ultimately be invested, how long it would take to repay the principal owed to them, or how much money they would need to make a loan to a specific company or individual, when in fact the funds would have been invested in other, unrelated, publicly-traded companies or by unrelated entities. Instead, they allegedly diverted investor money to support themselves and their businesses, used the money for other purposes and used it for the personal benefit of Williams's businesses and friends and associates, paid for his entertainment and entertainment expenses and, most recently, to purchase a historic Puerto Rican bank building. On the other hand, some investors received a portion of their principal from Williams without any legitimate entitlement to their investments, despite having been promised a 1% management fee by the time they were due to issue their final judgment on the same day.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Kinetic Group and Williams fraudulently raised millions of dollars by making material misrepresentations to investors who they solicited to invest in Kinetic Funds I, LLC, a purported hedge fund that they managed.  The defendants allegedly represented, among other things, that Kinetic Funds' largest sub-fund invested solely in U.S.-listed financial products and that at least 90% of its portfolio was hedged using listed options.  The SEC alleges, however, that Williams actually invested a significant part of the sub-fund's assets in a private start-up company owned by Williams.  The complaint further alleges Williams misappropriated at least $6.3 million through undisclosed loans to himself and his entities.  On March 6, 2020, U.S. District Court Judge William F. Jung granted the SEC's request for emergency relief, including an asset freeze and an order for records preservation, against Kinetic Group, Williams, and a number of companies charged by the SEC as relief defendants.  The court also granted the SEC's request to appoint Mark Kornfeld as receiver over Kinetic Group and the relief defendants.

The complaint alleges that the defendants used several marketing techniques to convince investors that their funds would be used to fund a Ponzi scheme, raising more over $1.2 billion from investors who had invested their retirement savings, and by convincing investors to roll over their investments into ""safe"" loans to third-party investors, 1 Global Capital, LLC (""1 Global"").  Investors were promised high rates of return on their principal and the difference representing their investment was represented to investors as a percentage of their total principal. In reality, most of the investors were Shapiro owned and controlled entities, which had no source of income, no bank accounts, or any other revenue to support the investment. As a result, investors stopped receiving their monthly interest payments and to date have received only a small amount of money back through the bankruptcy process.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that from approximately November 2015 until September 2016, Steven Joseph Mutehler, who lives in Marina Del Rey, Calif., operated an unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser, Alta Vista Capital Markets, LLC, that offered to sell bonds issued by so-called ""Fixed Income Investment Funds"" that were associated with the companies. According to the SEC, while working as an underwriter for these companies, Mueshler made numerous false and misleading statements and omissions, including that he and his companies had $50 million on hand to invest in their customers' securities, and that some of those investments were not registered with SEC-registered securities. In addition, he allegedly lied to small business owners to induce them to pay him for their services. The complaint further alleges, without admitting or denying the allegations in either the Complaint or the Commission's findings, defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties and penny stock bars.Â  The settlements are subject to court approval. On February 21, 2020, Judge Amy Jane Longo entered a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provision of Sections 5(c), 15(A), and 16(B)(5) under the Investment Advisers and Futures Trading Commission (""Advisers"") orders, imposing a $400,000 civil penalty and imposing an officer-and-director bar on the other defendants. Separately, a federal court in Minnesota entered an order temporarily restraining defendants and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership and registration of securities offerings of certain microcap issuers, which are required by the court to be registered as a broker or dealer.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three-time recidivist Steven J. Muehler with operating an unregistered broker-dealer, facilitating an unregistered securities offering, and defrauding small businesses, while promising to help them raise money from investors.  Three companies under Muehler's control, Muehler's wife, Claudia M. Muehler, and his associate, Koorosh ""Danny"" Rahimi, were also charged.  Because the scheme is ongoing, the SEC is also seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Muehler's ongoing violations of the securities laws, pending trial of the action.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, also charges Muehler with violating a cease-and-desist order issued by the Commission in 2016 barring Muehler from associating with any broker-dealer.  The SEC has filed a parallel action in the same court to enforce that Commission order.  According to the complaint, Muehler's companies are not registered as broker-dealers.  But since at least November 2015, Muehler and his companies have nonetheless agreed to provide broker-dealer services to more than 20 small businesses, including identifying and soliciting investors and utilizing a purportedly proprietary online securities exchange to help raise funds from investors.  In return, Muehler and his companies received fees, the right to a percentage of any funds raised from investors, and the right to an equity stake in each small business customer.  The SEC also alleges that in offering broker-dealer services, Muehler and his companies made numerous fraudulent claims to potential customers, including that Muehler and his companies had $50 million on-hand to invest in their customers' securities, that they had previously helped customers raise millions of dollars, and that their proprietary online exchange was registered with the SEC.  They also concealed that Muehler is subject to a Commission cease-and-desist order and has been sanctioned by California and Minnesota securities regulators.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Claudia Muehler and Danny Rahimi helped Muehler carry out this scheme.  The SEC's complaint charges Muehler and the three companies he controls (AltaVista Capital Markets, LLC, AltaVista Private Client, LLC, and AltaVista Securities, LLC) with violating Section 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a), Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and also charges Muehler with violating Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  It charges Claudia Muehler with aiding and abetting Muehler's and the AltaVista Companies' violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and charges Rahimi with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint also seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, has been conducted by M. Lance Jasper and Benjamin Faulkner, and supervised by Spencer E. Bendell.  The litigation will be led by Donald W. Searles and supervised by Amy J. Longo.",0.5897,0.497
16,"On September 29, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Accelera Innovations, Inc. (""Accelera""), a privately-held Illinois company, and its founder, Geoffrey J. Thompson, with defrauding the investing public.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that from at least 2013 through its 2015 Form 10-K and in its public filings, Acceleration portrayed itself as a provider of software when, in reality, it was not providing software to anyone. The complaint also alleges, among other things, that Accelerated falsely reported the revenues of a separate company that it did not own or control and that the acquisition of Behavioral Health Care Associates (BHCA) never took place. Accelerate also misled investors about its true financial condition, by failing to disclose that its purchase agreement with another company never existed and by signing the books and records of the other company. According to the complaint:  Accelerating its false financial results, including the number of shares it sold, inflated the company's revenues by more than $1.7 million, when in fact it never owned or controlled BHca.&nbsp;  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Accelerator's SEC filings and filings with the SEC, Defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC's complaint, filed on September 29, 2016, alleges that Accelera Innovations Inc.'s public filings included the revenues of a separate company that it did not own or control and, as a result, Accelera improperly inflated its annual revenue by up to 90 percent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Accelera portrayed itself as a provider of software when, in reality, it was not providing software to anyone.  Geoffrey Thompson, Accelera's founder, allegedly signed Accelera's annual reports.  The complaint also alleges that Thompson, acting through Accelera and Synergistic Holdings LLC, sold approximately $1.7 million worth of Accelera stock to investors, and that the sale was not registered or subject to any exemption from registration.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charge:  Accelera, Thompson, and Synergistic with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933;&nbsp;  Accelera and Thompson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder;&nbsp;  Accelera with violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and&nbsp;  Thompson with aiding and abetting Accelera's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.   The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, an officer-and-director bar against Thompson, and penny stock bars against Thompson and Synergistic.  The SEC separately charged John Wallin, Accelera's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with signing certifications as to the accuracy of Accelera's Forms 10-K and 10-Q that falsely attested that he had reviewed Accelera's financial statements when he had not.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Wallin with aiding and abetting Accelera's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder and with violating Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wallin agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director.  The judgment also provides that the amount of any civil penalty will be determined by the court at a future date.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC also separately charged Daniel Caravette, of St. Charles, Ill., with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  Caravette's alleged violations involved sales of stock in Accelera and a Canadian company founded by Thompson which claimed to be involved in medical marijuana production, distribution, infusion, research, and testing.  The SEC found that Caravette's transactions violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Caravette agreed to the entry of an order requiring him to cease-and-desist from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, to pay a total of $307,724.78, consisting of $243,332.13 in disgorgement, $24,392.65 in interest, and a $40,000 civil penalty, and to be barred from the industry, with a right to apply for reentry after three years.

17,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Brendan Matthew Ross, the former chief executive officer and 100% owner of Direct Lending Investments, LLC (DLI), for fraudulently overstating the value and returns of the funds.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Ross led a multi-year effort to overstate the fund's value by overstated the number of investors in DLI's investment funds by more than $53 million. The complaint alleges that, in a series of emails and in presentations to prospective and current investors, he allegedly misrepresented the Fund's historical returns, including the percentage of nonperforming loans that it took on, and the ""rebate"" amount of funds' assets under management. In addition, as alleged in his SEC filings, from at least 2014 through 2018, when he was the sole owner and managing member of DLi's Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (""Adviser Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (""Securities Act""), Ross lied to investors about his knowledge of, his role in and his involvement with the Funds' misstatements and misappropriation of money. He also allegedly provided investors with monthly account statements that contained information about the performance of certain funds, which he falsely claimed were performing well and were not subject to any accounting or rule of law violations. As a result of his misconduct with respect to QuarterSpot, investors were materially overbilled in their returns and had to pay additional management and performance fees to fund their investments. Investors were also disproportionately left with less than 10% of net asset value, a significant portion of which was paid to Ross' personal credit card company, for purposes of recovering their ill-gotten gains from defaulted loans or other financial losses incurred in connection with those loans.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from early 2014 through late 2017, Ross manipulated payment data for the funds' investment in loans made by QuarterSpot, Inc., an online small business lender.  Ross allegedly directed QuarterSpot to make payments to the funds, which gave the false impression that underlying borrowers were making principal payments on what were actually delinquent loans.  As alleged, under DLI's valuation policy, many of these non-performing loans should have been fully marked down but were not because of the payments Ross engineered.  According to the complaint, as a result of the scheme, DLI's monthly returns reported to investors were materially inflated.  DLI allegedly collected at least $5-6 million in extra management and performance fees from the funds, and Ross personally received millions of dollars from DLI.  The SEC previously charged DLI in 2019, which resulted in DLI and its affiliates being placed in receivership.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Central District of California, charges Ross with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from 2008 through 2014, Bernard M. Parker, a registered reprogator associated with a broker-dealer and investment adviser, induced investors to purchase investments in real estate tax liens, primarily those offered by municipalities in Florida, Arizona and Colorado. According to the complaint:  Parker told prospective investors that their funds would be used to buy tax lien certificates for municipal properties located in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and that Parker Financial Services would use the majority of the funds to make tax payments on the properties. In reality, Parker only used a small portion of investor funds for personal expenses, including a remodeling of his home, pay his father-in-law's medical bills, make interest payments to earlier investors and make a ""tax-free"" loan to an earlier investor. The complaint further alleges Parker used the vast majority to pay personal debts and, depending on municipality, penalties assessed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which is investigating Parker's alleged role in the scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint or in any other criminal proceeding the SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties and penny stock bars against Parker and his companies.Â The SEC also seeks a court-ordered injunction prohibiting Parker from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) thereunder, as well as an officer-and-director bar and a civil penalty.

The complaint further alleges, that in October 2016, Mekowy lied to a FINOP about an $1 million loan that was due to be repaid in due diligence, when he knew the loan had not been repaid and the funds were being withdrawn from the account. In addition, on a separate occasion, after learning that it had sufficient net assets, he submitted and submitted a forged account statement showing that he had more funds on deposit with its clearing firm than it actually did.

As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint:   In an effort to conceal the confidential nature of the announcement, Feafferman and Wigand allegedly tipped each other, and obtained illegal trading profits of approximately $530,000, including $19,132 in illicit profits, of more than $1,500.&nbsp;  Wieand also allegedly purchased and sold Arada stock for himself and his close friend and business associate, Akis C. Eracles Panayioutou, who also purchased the Aradaxi shares.Â  The traders allegedly profited from the illegal trades, as well as the unregistered traders' gains, by purchasing and selling the securities in advance of an announcement that Arodea would soon announce a global agreement with a pharmaceutical company to license a 9 cancer drug, which would result in a significant premium over the prior day's closing stock price. In a parallel action filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, on June 10, 2016, a federal district court entered a final judgment against the defendants, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $5,184.

Wiegand in advance of major public announcements related to two pharmaceutical trials, a licensing agreement for a cancer drug, and eventually the acquisition of the company by AstraZeneca PLC.  Wiegand, a stockbroker, purchased Ardea stock in various customer accounts based on the confidential information he received from Fefferman, and he tipped his friend and fellow stockbroker Akis C. Eracleous so he could similarly buy stock on behalf of his customers.  The alleged insider trading resulted in illegal profits of approximately $530,000.  One of Eracleous's customers, his cousin, has been named as a relief defendant in the SEC's complaint for the purpose of recovering insider trading profits in his brokerage account.  The cousin agreed to pay back the entire amount of illicit profits in his account totaling $219,175 in disgorgement and interest.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Slowinski, a Texas resident, was a principal and owner of Rebuilding America, LLC, which purportedly offered real estate investments. Slowinski and Rebuilding America allegedly told investors that Rebuilding America would pool investor proceeds to acquire, refurbish, and sell for profit residential real estate primarily located in the South Side of Chicago. Slowinski and Rebuilding America allegedly lured investors by touting Rebuilding America as a successful real estate program, and falsely promising to pay investors 38% returns in only two years.  They allegedly raised more than $20 million from over 600 investors with assistance from London-based Project Kudos Group Limited and Singapore-based Infinity Treasures Private Limited.

Slowinski allegedly quickly realized that Rebuilding America's business model was untenable, and would not be able to repay investors as promised.  Yet, Slowinski allegedly continued to solicit investors and accept the hidden fees.

In 2009 and 2010, Houlihan falsely told investors that for a limited time he was able to offer them Sanomedics shares at a steep discount to the stock's market price.  The complaint alleges further that Houlihan used investor monies to pay undisclosed sales commissions to boiler room sales agents and more than $110,000 to himself for personal expenses.  In 2013 and 2014, Houlihan signed Sanomedics' annual and quarterly filings with the SEC that contained false statements about Sanomedics' financing and did not disclose the illegal boiler room activity.  In December 2017, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida criminally charged Houlihan.  He was subsequently sentenced to 111 months imprisonment and ordered to pay approximately $21 million in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida on May 4, 2018, charges Houlihan with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and with aiding and abetting the boiler room's violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Sanomedics' violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  In addition to the lifetime bars, Houlihan agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC charged the boiler room operator, Miguel ""Michael"" Mesa, and Sanomedics' former CEO, Craig V. Sizer, with fraud in 2016.  A federal court subsequently entered consented-to final judgments against Mesa and Sizer that imposed lifetime penny stock bars on each of them and a lifetime officer-and-director bar on Sizer.  The SEC subsequently barred Mesa and Sizer from the securities industry.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gary M.

The complaint further alleges Miller consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206(1) and (2), and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000, which is deemed satisfied by the court's order. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Miller agreed to a permanent injunction and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-registered broker-dealer. In a parallel administrative proceeding, he also agreed not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of securities in any future public offering that is not subject to court approval.Â  The settlement is pending final approval by both the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, with respect to Miller's future criminal history.

The SEC also charged their lawyer, Ralph Craig Greaves, with aiding and abetting their scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, Sims, of Costa Mesa, California, and Procopio, of Newport Beach, California, operated a fraudulent scheme that raised over $1.4 million from investors.  To entice potential investors, Sims and Procopio allegedly falsely claimed investors' money would be invested in ""prime bank"" financial instruments that would generate astronomical returns of 1,200% to 40,000%.  The SEC further alleges that Sims and Procopio also falsely told investors they had special access to trade platforms used by governments, corporations, and wealthy investors to buy vast sums of currency, usually $500 million or more, at a discounted price.  Sims and Procopio allegedly told investors they could ""piggyback"" their money on these large trading platforms and reap huge returns with ""absolutely no risk.""  However, neither the financial instruments nor the trading platforms existed.  In actuality, Sims and Procopio allegedly used nearly all of the investor funds for their own personal expenses, including cars, jewelry, travel, and golf outings.  The SEC's complaint further alleges that Greaves, their San Diego based lawyer, aided and abetted their scheme by, among other things, allowing investors to deposit money into his attorney trust account, which gave the scheme a cloak of legitimacy.  Greaves then allegedly transferred most of these funds to Sims and Procopio despite knowing that they were misleading investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Sims, Procopio and the entities they controlled, ALC Holdings, LLC, El Cether-Elyown, and SIMS Equities, Inc., with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint further alleges, as a result of this conduct, Humphreys was prohibited from buying or holding the securities of any company directly regulated by the Commission. He was also not required to obtain pre-clearance for any of these trades and, on a number of occasions, did not obtain any prior approval for his trades.

Bressman, a resident of Montville, N.J., engaged in a pattern of cherry picking securities for himself and his family members in his role as a registered broker-dealer. The complaint further alleges, however, that he misused his access to customers' brokerage accounts to enrich himself, his sister-in-law and her husband, and the customers he entrusted with their retirement accounts. In addition to cherrypicking profitable trades, the complaint alleges he also cherry-picked unprofitable trades and delayed making any allocation of the stock to his own account or a group of customers. As alleged, in one instance, when the price of a particular stock rose during the day, he allegedly allocated the entire trade to one or more of these accounts and then delayed allocating it to the customer accounts until he saw the market price go up. Finally, as the alleged above graphic shows, if a stock went down during a trade, then the broker transferred the trades to other, disfavored accounts, giving these customers the resulting one-day loss of approximately $4,280. According to these complaints, from approximately January 2012 through February 2018, Bressedman violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (2)(A)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this case or in any other SEC complaint filed by the Commission, defendants have consented to permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, civil penalties and other relief. Defendants have also agreed to pay civil monetary penalties in amounts to be determined at a later time.","The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New Jersey-based broker with misusing his access to customers' brokerage accounts to enrich himself and family members at the expense of his customers, many of whom entrusted him with their retirement accounts. The SEC uncovered the alleged fraud with data analysis used to detect suspicious trading patterns.  The SEC filed fraud charges in federal district court against Michael A. Bressman of Montville, New Jersey, alleging that he misused his access to an omnibus or ""allocation"" account to obtain at least $700,000 in illicit trading profits over a six-year period ending in February. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bressman placed trades using the allocation account and cherry-picked profitable trades, which he then transferred to his own account and the account of two family members, while placing unprofitable trades in other customers' accounts. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Bressman.

55,"On September 30, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Connecticut-based investment adviser with defrauding retail investors out of nearly $4 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that James T. Booth, a resident of Norwalk, Conn., made false or misleading statements to investors, telling them their assets would be used to purchase securities, and then pocketing the investors' money to pay personal and business expenses, including meals, entertainment and trips to casinos. In addition, according to the SEC, Booth allegedly used fabricated account statements he received from investors to create the false appearance that their money was being used for investment purposes. As alleged, many of Booth's clients and customers were unsophisticated investors who utilized Booth Financial services for their retirement savings. The complaint alleges, however, that Booth routinely used assets fraudulently acquired from others to cover those withdrawals. For example, in one instance, when one investor requested to withdraw money from a client's investment account, he allegedly instructed the client to write checks to Insurance Trends, which he claimed to buy securities for himself. When the investor demanded to see a defined benefit plan for his daughter and son-in-law who had recently been widowed and had been unable to save enough to send money into the account. Instead, instead of using the money for personal expenses and to make payments to other investors in order to keep the Ponzi scheme going, his scheme collapsed, leaving the victims with approximately $3.9 million in ill-gotten gains. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC&rs.gov Complaint, Defendants have agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, as well as civil penalties of up to $100,000. Investors can also apply for a penny stock bar against Booth and pay a civil penalty against each of them.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut man with operating a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme that bilked over three dozen retail investors, including senior citizens saving for retirement, of $4 million in assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, from at least August 2014 to June 2019, James T. Booth, while operating an investment advisory and brokerage business, made false promises of safer investments and higher returns to convince investors to move assets out of their ordinary accounts.  Instead of purchasing securities, Booth allegedly deposited investors' funds into a bank account of an entity he controlled, and then moved the funds into his personal accounts and used them to pay for business and personal expenses, including meals, entertainment and numerous trips to casinos.  According to the complaint, Booth supplied his clients with detailed false account statements showing securities that he purportedly purchased on their behalf, many of which showed gains over time from the fictitious investments.  The complaint alleges that when investors asked to redeem some or all of their investments, Booth provided investors with Ponzi-like payments, using assets from new investors to pay back old investors.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Booth.  The SEC's complaint charges Booth with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks a permanent injunction from future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.

Smith, for defrauding at least four known investors out of $775,000 using a variation of a prime bank scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, between 2012 and 2013, Smith and his business partner, Joseph J. ""Joe"" Carswell, used two fictitious companies, Atlantis Capital LLC and Capital Funding, LLC, to fraudulently raise money from investors by promising returns of as much as 35% per week from non-recourse loans in the form of ""monetized"" loans. The complaint alleges that, after investors were told that the monetized proceeds would be loaned to them, they were disbursed to Smith in a manner that would produce returns in excess of 35%. In some cases, those returns were used to pay off the principal of the loan. In other instances, some investors have been successful in recovering more than a small portion of their investment proceeds from Smith or his companies. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint and in other SEC filings, Defendants Smith has consented to a final judgment that enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties and pay disgorgement with interest at a later date.

Investors were then allegedly told the proceeds from these purported financial instruments would be ""monetized"" and traded in a manner that would produce returns as high as 35% per week.  Smith and Carswell allegedly told investors these transactions were ""risk free"" and guaranteed.  Michael W. Fullard, of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is alleged to have acted as a ""finder,"" referring a victim investor to Smith and Carswell in exchange for a fee.  The Commission's complaint further alleges that rather than use investor funds to obtain the promised financial instruments, Smith, Carswell and Fullard almost immediately disbursed the investors' funds to themselves, in some cases just hours after they were received.  The Commission's complaint charges Smith and Carswell with violations of the antifraud  provisions of the federal securities laws under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Dominic Lacroix and Sabrina Paradis-Royer, of Quebec City, fraudulently raised more than $15 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2017.  According to the complaint:   the PlexCoin ICO was a general solicitation made on the Internet and distributed throughout the world, including in the U.S. and elsewhere, and the investors were promised ""tokenized currency"" that would ""Take control of [THEIR] money!""  But as alleged, as a result of the fraud, investors' funds were used to pay for personal expenses and to make payments to a purported PlexCorps team of supposed experts.Â  The complaint further alleges, that the defendants misrepresented to investors that their tokens would be used in a ""market maintenance"" team that included a member of a PlexCorp team who claimed to be an ""executive director"" at a private company that owned and operated the company, when the actual executive was actually an employee of one of those companies, who was not named in court orders or otherwise enjoined from violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b)(5)(A) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(c) thereunder and Sections 5, 5(d), and 5 (e) the Investment Advisers and Futures Trading Commission's (FAFC) Rules of Practice (""Advisers"") and Rules 5b2-1 and (2) as well as Rules 13a-11 and 13b3-3, which prohibits certain securities laws violators from participating in securities offerings or offering them an investment in any securities, without admitting or denying the allegations of, or having any reasonable basis to project returns on investments in, securities offered or sold in connection with the offering of these securities.","On December 1, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his company, PlexCorps, in an emergency action to halt an alleged Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud that raised up to $15 million from thousands of investors.

The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants made material false and misleading statements to market makers to obtain clearance for the companies to be sold on the open market, and that they used cash supplied by the puppet CEOs to ""buy"" the stock. According to the complaint:   As alleged, in the course of the alleged scheme, from at least 2006 to 2010 and 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014 and 2015 and 2016 to 2017 and 2018 to 2016 and 2020.Â  The defendants also allegedly used a computer consultant to destroy emails and documents from the puppeteers, to hide the identity of one of those puppets and to conceal the other puppet CEO's identity and role as the control person behind the scheme.&nbsp;  In a parallel action, on November 21, 2015, a U.S. District Judge granted a request for a temporary restraining order and entered a final judgment permanently enjoining the Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 15(d)(3)(A), and the registration provision of Section 20(e)(a).

The 8-count indictment, returned May 18, 2017, also charges Jaclin with obstruction of justice of two SEC investigations.  Jaclin was charged in 2016 in a parallel SEC matter.  According to the indictment, Jaclin was an attorney specializing in penny stock companies.  He worked with another individual-an undisclosed control person-to incorporate ten new companies, take them public, help get regulatory clearance to enable public trading of their stock, and sell them.  Eight companies were sold for a total of approximately $2.25 million.  Two companies were the subject of SEC enforcement actions before they could be sold.  (see Stop Orders 33-9444 (Aug. 22, 2013) and 33-9577 (April 23, 2014)).  According to the indictment, for each company and with Jaclin's knowledge or at his suggestion or direction, the control person hired a CEO and created a business plan to give the impression of a real company poised for growth.  In fact, each CEO took all direction from the control person, and the true plan was to sell the company.  Jaclin and those working at his direction, however, prepared numerous false and misleading documents that hid the control person and the actual business plan:  registration statements to take the companies public; quarterly and annual reports; and attorney opinion letters.  Jaclin also facilitated the sale of the shell companies by locating some of the purchasers and documenting all of the transactions.  The criminal case against Jaclin is based on much of the same conduct alleged in an amended SEC complaint, which was filed on November 22, 2016.  The SEC's complaint alleged that Jaclin and his co-defendant, undisclosed control person Imran Husain, engaged in a ""shell factory"" scheme to create and sell public companies at a profit.  The SEC's amended complaint charged:  (i) Husain with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, as a control person, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Jaclin with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Husain and Jaclin, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting violations of Section 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (iv) Husain and Jaclin with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, and 15d-13 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that between November 2014 and May 2016, Viking and its former CFO, Guangfang ""Cecile"" Yang, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive investors by falsely reporting that Yang was Viking's CEO, and falsely representing that the CEO had performed an evaluation of the financial reporting and that he had provided material assistance to Yang. The complaint further alleges, that in reality, Yang did not perform any functions as the Company's COO, nor did she participate in audits of specific initial public offerings or prepare financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. In addition, according to SEC filings, from at least 2014 through 2017, as part of a series of misstatements and omissions that were included in the periodic reports Viking filed with the Commission, a number of these misrepresentations were false, misleading, or omitted to state material facts.

The SEC alleges that Tom Simeo, a resident of New York City, New York, created the false impression to the public that Viking had an experienced financial professional involved in its operations and financial reporting as its CFO, when in reality, the Company had no CFO.  According to the complaint, between November 2014 and May 2016, Viking's public filings falsely disclosed that Guangfang ""Cecile"" Yang was Viking's CFO.  In addition, as alleged, certain SOX certifications accompanying these filings falsely represented that Yang, as Viking's CFO, had performed an evaluation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and reviewed Viking's annual and quarterly reports.  The SEC alleges that Simeo created the false appearance that Yang served as CFO by repeatedly affixing Yang's signature to Viking's periodic reports and SOX certifications.  The SEC alleges that, aside from Yang's purported signatures on Viking's filings, there is no evidence that Yang functioned as the Company's CFO from at least November 2014 through Yang's purported resignation in July 2016.

Paulsen, a former investment adviser at a registered broker-dealer, with aiding and abetting a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund.  According to the SEC's complaint, from early 2014 until February 2016, Navnoor S. Kang was the Fund's Director of Fixed Income and Head Portfolio Strategist. The complaint alleges that Kang solicited and received improper entertainment from Kang during the course of his employment, including $8,000 for a private jet ski trip, and $1,200 for four VIP tickets to a Paul Mc Cartney concert. In exchange, Kang directed public pension trades to Kang at the brokerage, earning sizable commissions on the trades. Later, when the Broker-Dealer discovered inconsistencies in the expense reports and began an internal investigation, Kelley and Kang conspired to lie and/or conceal their receipt of the improper gifts and entertainment, while failing to disclose that they were receiving them as part of a quid pro quo scheme with Kang. Finally, after Kang left the firm in February 2015, he and Kelley secretly sought reimbursement of those expenses from the broker dealer, despite the fact that one of their colleagues had warned them not to do so. As a result of this conduct, they incurred more than $11,500 in expenses entertaining Kang and his girlfriend, in exchange for access to NYSCRF business. To hide their conduct from their customers and colleagues, their commissions were significantly higher than they would have been had they not been for the benefit of Kang's girlfriend and the brokers had been tipped off about the scheme by the fund's internal investigators. After the investigation was conducted by staff members at an asset management firm, it was determined that the funds were not being managed in accordance with the federal securities laws and that it would be best to keep the matter a secret from investors and to avoid any conflicts of interest. Additionally, as the complaint further alleges, that when Kang returned to his firm after a year and a half of work, his wife, Deborah D. Kelley, was hired as a portfolio manager and directed to provide material assistance to Paulson. She also provided the entertainment and other benefits that were promised to her husband and another asset manager in return for their assistance in this matter.

In reality, Holdings never raised over $5 million, despite repeated requests from investors, many of whom did not invest, for their own personal use and to repay older investors.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that from at least October 2006 through February 2014, Place and Kirk operated and controlled a ""transition management"" firm that was purportedly supposed to handle large orders to buy and sell equity and fixed-income securities for public pension funds, including many retirement retirement funds held for the benefit of municipal employees and fire departments.Â  The complaint further alleges, however, that the defendants did not tell their customers that GTS shared in undisclosed mark-ups on customer orders, nor did they ever specifically disclose the existence or the costs associated with executing such trades.&nbsp;  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint:  From 2006 until February 2015, defendants engaged in a long-standing scheme to deceive their retail customers about the nature of the markups they received from customers and to conceal their receipt of commissions and other compensation from the customers. The defendants also allegedly prepared bogus scripts for execution research ostensibly used by the routing brokers, called ""Trade Cost Awareness"" or ""TCA,"" that falsely claimed that they would not receive any commissions from those transactions, but instead paid commissions based on the customer's sophistication and price sensitivity when, in fact, they were simply ""markups"" that were buried in pre-trade reports they prepared for customers in order to hide their losses.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that from approximately July 2013 to July 2015, Guerrio and his co-conspirators operated a classic boiler room scheme in which they defrauded investors by making false and fraudulent statements to investors, including, among other things, telling them that the ""voice verification system"" was a legally binding contract that goes through three levels of compliance. The complaint further alleged that, as part of their fraudulent practices, they used high-pressure, strong-armed tactics to intimidate and coerce individuals to invest. In addition, defendants allegedly told investors that they could ""lock-in"" an investor's purchase price by simply pressing a button on a telephone keypad. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint:&nbsp; The defendants also allegedly promised investors the chance to purchase Oxford city stock directly from the company, without disclosing the true nature of the security being offered, or the material facts about the stock.&nsqua; the defendants made no such promises, and the investors were left with only a few hundred dollars to spend on their own expenses and to pay their bills at home and at the expense of other investors and their family members. Investors were told that their money would be used to fund their personal expenses, such as rent, car payments, vacations, meals, travel, entertainment, school tuition, medical school fees, retirement savings, mortgage loans, automobile financing, credit card debt, student loans and student loan debt.Â  In reality, it was just a ""boiler room.""  In a parallel criminal case, a federal court in Miami, Florida entered a final judgment on June 21, 2016, permanently enjoining Guerriero from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, from approximately July 2013 to July 2015, Diana P. Lovera and others at Oxford City used pressure tactics and a boiler room of salespeople to raise approximately $6.6 million from more than 150 investors, many of whom were unaccredited, through the sale of millions of unregistered shares of Oxford City stock. The complaint alleges that, in connection with these unregistered stock offerings, Lovera made numerous misstatements to investors about Oxford City's assets, its business plan, its future profitability, and the composition of its management. The complaint further alleges that Lovera and others falsely told prospective investors they could ""lock in"" a discounted price on Oxford City stock using the company's ""voice verification system,"" which they claimed linked the investor's personal information to a filing with the SEC. In reality, the complaint alleges, there was no such voice verification system; Lovera and others merely pressed buttons on a telephone key pad to mimic a recording device.  Lovera was charged criminally in a parallel case. She pled guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and was sentenced to 20-month prison term, which she is now serving, and ordered to pay, jointly and severally with other defendants, approximately $6.31 million in restitution.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Lovera with violating Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. To settle the charges, Lovera agreed to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws; imposes a conduct-based injunction, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar; and orders her to pay disgorgement of $81,374 plus prejudgment interest of $3,343, which will be deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered against her in the criminal case. Lovera also consented to an SEC order imposing a permanent associational bar.  The SEC previously charged Oxford City and its former CEO, Thomas Anthony Guerriero, and a relief defendant owned by Guerriero. Earlier this year, the SEC obtained final judgments against Oxford City, Guerriero, and the relief defendant. Guerriero also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and was sentenced to a 12 1/2 year prison term.

Haddad and two companies he controlled, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC, with conducting a fraudulent scheme to raise at least $2.5 million from investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that from April 2012 through August 2016, the three companies engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which they solicited investors to invest in their companies and to fund the operations and growth of the companies. The complaint alleges, among other misstatements and omissions, that the defendants raised funds from retail investors, art and antiques, entertainment, and a dog rescue charity, while failing to disclose to investors that they were raising funds to build and grow the company's business. According to the complaint:  HADDad, through his companies, used investor funds for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes and art projects, entertaining at his properties, retail and veterinary services expenses, remodeling his home, dining and dining at several of his residences, purchasing a house for himself, renovating his apartment, buying a home and other personal items, making payments to earlier investors and making P&L payments in the name of a charity he co-owned with the entities.

Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors. Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC. Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012. He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds. According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad. Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors. The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

71,"On September 9, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Charles Augustus Banks, IV, an Atlanta, Georgia-based investment adviser, with defrauding a former professional basketball player out of $7.5 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that between May 2012 and October 2012, Banks made material misrepresentations to the investor regarding Gameday Entertainment, LLC's plans to offer two investors the opportunity to invest in a $15 million mezzanine debtand equity offering of the company, for which each investor would receive 12% interest and a security interest, and then receive a return of at least $180,000 from the investment as consideration for providing the other investor's money. Banks also allegedly instructed the Investor to divert $6 million of his funds to another line of credit that he controlled, to pay a 3% ""guarantee fee,"" or $14 million, that was due to a second investor. As alleged, none of these representations were true and Banks knew that no other individual had invested the money, nor did he know that it would not be retired so that the investing investor could obtain a first lien position on the investments. In addition, he allegedly told the individual that only the signature page of a guarantee document be sent to him, which substantially increased the risk in his investment. Finally, after Banks failed to disclose the additional risk to his investor, his conduct increased his risk of being harmed by the alleged fraud. The complaint charges Banks with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a) and (b) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)(5) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, Bowers consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, a penny stock bar and an officer and director bar, as well as a civil monetary penalty. He also agreed to be enjoined from future securities laws violations, from participating in securities offerings or in association with any broker-dealer that does not comply with the registration requirements of Section 20(e). The settlement is subject to court approval.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has charged Atlanta-based investment adviser Charles Augustus Banks, IV with defrauding a former professional basketball player by inducing him to invest in a sports team apparel and merchandise company based on a series of misrepresentations about the investment.  The SEC alleges that Banks persuaded his client to invest $7.5 million in Gameday Entertainment LLC and falsely told him that another investor was investing the same amount.  The SEC further alleges that Banks told the client that $5 million of the purported $15 million offering would be used for Gameday's ongoing operations, the remaining balance would pay off existing bank debt, and the client would then have a first lien position on Gameday's assets.  But Banks allegedly knew there was no other investor, the full $15 million would not be raised, and the bank debt would not be paid off, leaving the client without the first lien position he was promised.  Meanwhile, Banks allegedly misappropriated approximately $543,000 from his client, taking an undisclosed fee of $225,000 out of the client's investment and secretly siphoning $15,000 from each $75,000 monthly interest payment from Gameday to his client for approximately two years.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal district court in Atlanta, Banks further deceived the client into signing a personal guarantee on a bank line of credit for Gameday and subordinating his existing Gameday investment to the new line of credit.  Banks deceptively had only the signature pages of the personal guarantee and subordination agreement sent to his client and falsely represented the terms of the agreement contained in the other pages.  Banks allegedly pocketed the &quot;guarantee fee&quot; that should have been paid to the client in exchange for providing the guarantee.  The SEC's complaint charges Banks with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The complaint further alleges Harbour used the investor money to support his personal lifestyle, which included spending over $100,00 to make purchases at Neiman Marcus, Target, and a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, as well as to repay a previous debt owed to Harbour by another investor. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona today announced criminal charges against Harbour arising from a related action by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in which Harbour pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years.

The SEC alleges that Harbour told the investors he would use their money exclusively for revenue-generating businesses, and promised them high annual returns, ranging from 12% to 20%. Instead, the SEC alleges, Harbour diverted substantial portions of the invested funds for personal purposes that included paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal credit card expenses, such as expenses for private jets, cruises, stays at resorts, and a payment to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Harbour also allegedly used the investor money to make payments on personal loans and debts he owed to investors in prior business ventures.

(ARSP), were engaged in a scheme to artificially inflate the value of ARSP's stock by disseminating false and misleading press releases touting the company's plans to acquire the Mona Lisa Hotel and Casino located in San Jose, Costa Rica. The defendants allegedly used a strawman to deceive investors, who were misled to believe that the transaction was a sham, that it was actually a long-term investment and had no significant financial history. In reality, the SEC alleges, as a result of the alleged scheme, all of these lies were true and the defendants concealed their true roles in the scheme from the public.Â The SEC further alleges Madssen recruited Fried to serve as an attorney and to act as CEO in connection with the allegedly fraudulent scheme.

The SEC alleges that Madsen concealed a past guilty plea to mail fraud by recruiting Fried to serve as a strawman executive of Andalusian while Madsen called the shots from behind the scenes.  According to the SEC's complaint, Fried drafted press releases at Madsen's direction announcing the company's intent to acquire a Costa Rican hotel and touting anticipated revenue from the hotel acquisition. Andalusian's press releases were allegedly misleading as the company had no assets, operations, or ability to finance the purchase of the hotel or otherwise satisfy the requirements of the potential transaction.  The SEC alleges that the party with whom Andalusian had entered into a letter of intent to purchase did not even have legal title to the hotel, which was in bankruptcy.  According to the SEC's complaint, Andalusian's misrepresentations were intended to fraudulently generate public demand for the company's stock to enable Madsen or his associates to profit from selling their shares into the artificially-inflated market.  However, the SEC effectively halted the pump-and-dump scheme before it had the intended effect by suspending trading in Andalusian's securities soon after dissemination of the press releases.

As alleged, however, as soon as he told his clients that their funds would be invested in a variable annuity, they did not invest the money for their own use. Instead, Romers commingled approximately two million of the customer funds for a total of $4.4 million, which he used for his own personal use and to pay personal expenses, including mortgage payments, credit card bills, shopping, college costs, and a mortgage payment.

According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in 2014, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson, while employed as investment advisers at a large financial institution, engaged in various schemes to defraud their clients, including stealing nearly $450,000 from one elderly client.

Then, from March through May of 2017, Polese made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the same client's account totaling approximately $93,000 to pay Polese's credit card and college tuition expenses for Polese's children.  In addition to stealing client funds, the complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson breached their fiduciary duty to their clients when they (1) secretly put client funds at risk by using a client's assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a private entity in which Polese and Peterson were investors, and (2) invested client funds into an investment in which defendants held a financial interest, without informing the client or disclosing their conflict of interest.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2012 to 2013, Robert E. Basinger, Jr., of Glen Cove, New Jersey, made false and misleading statements to investors in connection with the sale of his company's shares in an unprofitable manner. The complaint further alleges, that in 2013 and 2014, Beringer and his firm raised more than $1.5 million from investors by selling his stock in advance of an announcement that the company was going to merge with a publicly-traded company, and that he would pay a substantial premium to acquire the stock at a later date.Â  According to the Complaint, after the merger was announced in late 2014 and the two companies agreed to a cease-and-desist agreement that would prohibit them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, including Section 10(b) the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5(c) and Section 15(e) thereon, as well as Rule 15e-1, under which the defendants will be liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, for a total of $2.2 million, which is equal to those amount paid to them by the SEC in a separate administrative proceeding.

According to the SEC's complaint, Stephen J. Leonard, a resident of Palm Harbor, Florida, made $107,000 in illicit profits by trading in the stock of Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a California-based biotechnology company where his sibling worked in a senior position, before Puma announced positive clinical trial results for its cancer drug.  As alleged in the complaint, from May 11 through July 18, 2014, Leonard and his sibling had four telephone conversations.  During those conversations, the sibling allegedly shared material, nonpublic information about Puma's drug trial with Leonard, trusting and expecting that he would keep the information confidential.  But, after each conversation, Leonard bought Puma stock based on material, non-public information, breaching a duty of trust and confidence to his sibling.  Leonard's final purchases of Puma stock were made on July 22, 2014, just hours before Puma publicly announced the positive results from its drug trial.  After the announcement, Puma's stock price nearly quadrupled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges Leonard with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The defendants also allegedly failed to inform prospective investors that these transactions were subject to SEC approval, which is required by law to be approved by the court.

The SEC alleges that Nevada-based microcap issuer Intertech Solutions, Inc., which purports to be a project finance and management company for mining operations, William Scott Marshall, and David Naylor raised over $7 million from hundreds of investors throughout the United States and Canada. According to the SEC, Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor misled investors about the value of Intertech’s gold mine interest, Intertech’s timeframe for generating revenue, and commission payments Intertech made to securities solicitors. The complaint also alleges that, at Marshall’s direction, Intertech hired numerous individuals to engage in cold-call solicitations of investors. Finally, Marshall and Naylor allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds, which they used to pay for personal expenses such as such as gym memberships, resort stays, personal medical expenses, and a car Marshall exclusively used.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Kevin R. Kuhnash and Jason J. Jimerson, respectively the former CEO and former COO of Lucent Polymers Inc., misled customers about the company's purported ability to turn ""garbage to gold"" into high-quality plastics that met customer specifications. The complaint further alleges, as alleged, that the defendants lied to investors about their own equity stakes and misrepresented to customers that their investments would be rewarded with returns of up to 20% per year. In reality, Kuhnaash, Jimanderson's companies were not profitable because they did not disclose their fraud to potential buyers. Instead, they sold their equity in a stock that was not registered with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the alleged fraud. According to the complaint filed in federal court in Evansville, Indiana, between 2007 and 2013, LuCent, a privately-held plastics manufacturer based in Ohio, and its former Chief Operating Officer, Jason P. Jeffries, were fraudulently falsifying test results to fool potential customers into believing that it was a successful business. As a result of this conduct, Lehmann's stock price increased and he sold his remaining equity stake in his company to Citadel Plastics Holdings, LLC, for a profit of more than $1.3 million. After the SEC investigation was conducted, however, it became increasingly apparent that Lehman's fraud was real and that he was hiding it from investors by making material misrepresentations to conceal his fraud and by scheming to hide the fraud from the public. For example, in one instance, when a customer ordered a plastic to replace an old product with a newer one, he allegedly sent the customer a fake test result that showed that his product had ""failed"" to meet certain specifications, even though the test had been performed. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, Hendelman agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 17(a) and (b)(5)(B)(2)(A).

89,"On September 27, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged 1pool Ltd. a.k.a. 1Broker and Patrick Brunner with illegally selling security-based swaps to U.S. investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, alleges that, since at least 2012, 1broker, which is registered as a registered broker in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, has offered and sold securities based on the securities of three companies that are not registered with the SEC as broker-dealers. The complaint further alleges, from 2012 until September 2018 the defendants marketed security based swaps as ""CFDs"" that track the price of securities and other assets without actually owning the underlying assets. In failing to register the CFDs, they sold millions of dollars of bitcoin across their brokerage accounts, generating more than $1.5 million of illicit profits for investors, who were allegedly duped out of their money by the dealers. According to the complaints, none of this information was ever disclosed to investors and the investors were never compensated for their purchases. As a result, investors are left with a false impression of how much money has been invested in a specific security and how little is actually being traded in that particular security. For example, one investor who purchased a long or short position in one CFD paid a ""one-time fee"" of $25,000, and another investor bought a short-term investment using the same cryptocurrency. Investors can also buy and sell security -based swap with or for a person that is not an eligible contract participant, without being registered under the federal securities laws.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least September 2015 through March 2016, the defendants inflated the values of the funds' securities by more than 100%.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to what the Defendants told investors, these inflated valuations enabled premium Point to receive excess fees from investors and enabled the fund to overpay for its advisory services and to raise additional investor funds for itself.Â  The SEC further alleges, as alleged, that the scheme collapsed as the Fund's performance deteriorated and some of its major investors were requesting large redemptions from its funds, prompting the firm to sell securities at inflated prices to attract investors to invest in a new fund.&nbsp;  In a parallel action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Defendants agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty and an officer-and-director bar.

According to the SEC's complaint, the scheme ran from at least September 2015 through March 2016 and relied on a secret deal where in exchange for sending trades to a broker-dealer, Premium Point received inflated broker quotes for mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  In addition, the defendants allegedly used ""imputed"" mid-point valuations, which were applied in a manner that further inflated the value of securities. This practice allegedly boosted the value of many of Premium Point's MBS holdings and further exaggerated returns.

According to the complaint, on July 21, 2016, after a supervisor asked him to conduct a due diligence related site visit to Sequenaom's SanDiego facilities to perform a confidential check on the pending acquisition, he bought a total of 9,300 shares of stock, which at the time of his purchase were trading between $0.84 and $1.88 per share. On the first trading day after the announcement, Madans sold all of those shares, reaping ill-gotten gains of $14,023. After the merger announcement on August 2, 2019, his stock price increased 176%, and he sold his entire position in Sequeni stock.

The complaint alleges that Young falsely represented to investors that he would use their money for legal fees or other expenses, when in reality he simply spent the investors' money on personal expenses and on his own expenses. To date, he has not paid his investors the promised returns nor returned any of their investments.Â  The SEC further alleges Young violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the securities laws and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration requirements for securities offerings.

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Philadelphia and unsealed yesterday, alleges that from July 2016 through at least February 2020 Rowlands engaged in a fraudulent scheme to trick investors into investing in stocks, initial public offerings (IPOs), foreign currency exchange, or purported ""cryptocurrency"" trading with his company, Roaring Investments, Inc. Instead of using investors' funds for his personal benefit, RowLAND allegedly used the majority of investor funds to repay existing investors, and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors in the scheme. The complaint further alleges, however, that, despite promising investors that he would invest their money in all of these things, instead of investing the funds as promised, he spent the vast majority on personal expenses, including the purchase of several luxury vehicles, jewelry, personal residences, travel and home equity loans. In addition, according to the SEC, rather than using the investor proceeds for investment purposes, such as making returns on existing investments or acquiring new investments,Rowland allegedly provided investors with fake account statements that made it appear as though investors had invested their funds in any stocks or IPOs. As alleged, as part of this scheme, investors were inexperienced and financially unsophisticated and did not want to invest the money they invested in their personal accounts. To keep the fraud going and prevent investors from finding out that they were being duped into buying the investments from the company they promised to fund, Roweland created fictitious account balances, manipulated an on-line trading system, made false statements about the nature of investments and failed to disclose his fraud to investors. Finally, when investors demanded a distribution of their investment in purported cryptocurrencies or ""Forex"" traded securities, ROWLAND lied to them about his qualifications and experience trading securities and used false account information to convince investors not to trade in those securities.

The complaint alleges that Rowland induced investors to purchase securities by falsely claiming that he was an experienced and licensed trader, and that he would use their funds to invest in a variety of securities and currency products.  Rowland also allegedly guaranteed potential investors returns ranging from 20% within weeks to 140% within one year.  As alleged, a number of investors liquidated retirement accounts or obtained home equity loans to invest with Rowland based on his false claims.  The complaint further alleges that Rowland provided existing investors phony account updates to convince them to reinvest rather than cash out their investments.  Rowland allegedly invested only a fraction of investor proceeds as promised, and used the majority of investors' funds for personal expenses and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.

The complaint further alleged that, in late April and early May, after Function (""x"") raised $4.8 million from at least 50 investors in a public securities offering (the ""May Offering"") that raised only $10 million of investments, he transferred $500,000 of that money to his personal bank account, which was then used to repay loans he owed to Function (x).

The SEC further alleges that Sillerman created phony subscription documents, with forged signatures, purportedly from the two celebrities.

108,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against three oil-and-gas operators, Paul R. Montgomery, Jr. and Michael D. Fisher, for their roles in a fraudulent oil and gas investment scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, from approximately June 2016 through early 2017, defendants raised at least $2.7 million from 15 investors by offering and selling securities, in the form of joint venture interests in two oil projects. The complaint alleges that defendants spent a significant portion of investor funds on commissions to salesmen and marketing materials to solicit investors. In the end, the investors suffered a complete loss of their funds. Investors were left with a total of approximately $3.4 million in ill-gotten gains and losses of nearly $20,000. Most of the money was used to drill new wells and rework existing wells in South Texas, and the rest was spent on marketing, sales commissions and other personal expenses. Some investors were not even told about the lease injunctions or title issues until April 2017 when Energon3, a Texas-based company that Montgomery and Fisher controlled, agreed to a court-ordered injunction prohibiting them from drilling or reworking any wells. As a result of these actions, investors lost their money and had to resort to other means to make up for the lost gains, including paying commissions on sales of oil leases and paying for a sales agent and a truckload of other expenses for Montgomery's personal use. Finally, Willingham and Montgomery aided and abetted each other's violations of antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Rules of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants have consented to be restrained and enjoined from violating the charged provisions, as well as to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,078, which will be determined by the court at a later date. Additionally, Fisher has agreed not to participate in any offering of unregistered securities until he is satisfied that he has satisfied his obligations under the securities laws and that the amount of his compensation is sufficient to offset any losses incurred in his or her other securities offerings. This settlement is subject to court approval.","On May 18, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued three Texas residents who used deceptive offering materials and promotional videos to sell $2.7 million in fraudulent oil & gas investments.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Antonio, Texas, alleges that defendants Paul Russell Montgomery, Jr., Michael David Fisher, and James Hurst Willingham, Jr. promised investors that they would drill and recomplete oil and gas wells in South Texas to generate returns of 32% or more. To bolster these promises, the defendants allegedly disseminated promotional videos that purported to show the wells defendants had drilled and included interviews with purported investors who were invested or interested in the projects.  As alleged, the defendants also distributed written offering materials in which they promised to use investor funds only for specified purposes, with the vast majority going to actual drilling and recompletion activities.  In addition, the defendants allegedly touted Montgomery's credentials and prior success as an oil and gas operator.  According to the complaint, however, the defendants never drilled or recompleted any wells, and instead misappropriated investor funds, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for a number of uses not permitted in the offering documents, such as undisclosed commissions, and payments to Montgomery and Willingham.  The complaint further alleges that some of the purported ""investors"" identified in the defendants' promotional videos never invested, and that Montgomery's purported credentials and prior successes were fabrications.  The SEC's complaint charges Willingham, Montgomery, and Fisher with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Montgomery and Fisher with aiding and abetting Willingham's violations of the charged antifraud provisions.  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.

110,"On May 11, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Clinton Maurice Tucker II, a California resident, alleging that he acted as an unregistered broker in a matched-trading scheme involving microcap companies Intertch Solutions, Inc. (ITS).  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least December 2014 through May 2019, Tucker and his companies engaged in matched trading schemes in which they solicited investors to purchase shares of companies that were seeking to dump their shares.  The complaint alleges that Tucker, through various entities he controlled, obtained large blocks of ostensibly unrestricted stock of ITEC through private transactions and sought to sell those shares into the market without causing the shares to crash. The SEC alleges, however, that the selling shareholders were not registered as a broker or dealer with the Commission, and instead paid a portion of the proceeds to a third investor, who was also a registered broker. As alleged, in some instances, defendants used a variety of fictitious names, including David Heinz, Clifton Jone, Steve Smith and CJ Wilson, to conceal his true identity from investors and to mislead investors. In one instance, he allegedly told a prospective investor that she would receive a warrant as compensation if the stock increased in value, but the investor never received the promised payments. Finally, one investor received a check from a different solicitor for $33,000, which was bounced back and used to pay for his own personal expenses, such as gasoline, restaurant bills and credit card payments, while another investor was being charged with a similar fraud for making a Ponzi-like scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties and penny stock bars against each defendant, as well as officer-and-director and officer bar against the other defendants.

Currid entered a final judgment enjoining Tucker from future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to disgorge $1,038,768 plus interest of $32,500 and a $6,100 civil penalty of 10 years, for a total of over $2.5 million.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Clinton Maurice Tucker II with engaging in fraud and acting as an unregistered broker in connection with the sale of numerous microcap securities.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least May 2015 until May 2019, Tucker worked in several boiler-room-like operations to enable shareholders who owned large blocks of illiquid microcap securities to dump their shares without causing the price of the shares to crash.  As alleged, Tucker cold-called prospective investors and convinced them to purchase shares of the microcap companies that his selling clients wanted to liquidate.  The complaint alleges that Tucker would determine the amount of shares that the prospective investors wanted to purchase and the prices at which they would buy.  Tucker allegedly then relayed that information to the selling shareholders, who entered sell orders at the coordinated prices and volumes, making it highly likely that their sell orders and the solicited investors' buy orders would match.  Through this alleged matched trading, the selling shareholders were able to offload their shares into a market that Tucker had helped create.  In addition to working as a sales agent in the matched-trading scheme, Tucker allegedly pitched fictitious investment opportunities to particularly vulnerable investors whom he identified while working in the boiler rooms.  Instead of investing the funds he obtained from these investors as he had represented he would, Tucker allegedly spent the funds on personal expenses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Tucker with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.Â The SEC seeks injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against Tucker.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Micheal A. Skerry, of New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, illegally profited by manipulating the price and demand of Success Holding Group International, Inc., a penny stock whose securities were quoted on OTC Link, through a practice known as ""scalping."" The SEC alleges that he entered into agreements with Success Holdings to provide investor relations services and to purchase shares of Success Holdings stock at a discount.  Skerry allegedly paid $36,000 to Success Holding in exchange for 360,000 shares of Success Holding stock and immediately began taking steps to generate interest in the company through a fraudulent campaign to drive up public demand for Success Holding stock.  Among other things, the SEC's complaint alleges that Skerry posted misleading messages on public websites and sent blast emails to potential investors urging them to buy Success Holding stock without telling them that he owned the stock and intended to sell it at the earliest opportunity.  The SEC alleges that Skerry sold all his shares of Success Holding stock to the public for a profit of over $950,000.  Skerry's sales allegedly made up more than 60% of the trading volume during the period, including 100% of the trading volume on certain days.  The SEC's complaint charges Skerry with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC's order ffinds that Success Holding violated Section 5 of the Securities Act, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC's order, Success Holding agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay disgorgement of $36,000, prejudgment interest of $3,737 and civil penalties of $100,000, for a total of $139,737 in four installments. Success Holding also agreed to bring its filings with the SEC current. The SEC also instituted administrative proceedings under Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act to revoke Success Holding's registration in the event that Success Holding fails to bring its filings current. The SEC's order stays the revocation proceedings to provide Success Holding time to comply.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jedediah B.

Wasserman of Weston, Florida with improperly commingling corporate and personal funds as part of a practice to transfer funds to the U.S. while avoiding foreign currency controls.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, beginning in December 2014, Wasserman, then the outsourced CFO to a publicly-traded microcap company headquartered in China, improperly transferred more than $400,000 in corporate funds from China to his personal bank account and to Issuer A, a corporate bank based in New York City, China. The complaint further alleged that Wasserman previously engaged in a similar practice with at least two other China-based public companies, and Wasserman transferred over $1.7 million of the company's corporate proceeds into Wasserman's personal account. In a series of nine transactions over a 20-month period over the last 20 months, over nearly a hundred percent of corporate money was transferred to Wasserman. As alleged, in violation of Sections 13(b)(5) and 14(a)(2)(A), Wasserman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(d) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action or in any other action the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars and officer-and-director bars against Wasserman and his business, Oncall, Inc., and an officer and director bar from serving as officers or directors of any issuer that has a class of securities registered under Section 12(j) or that is required to file reports with the Commission on Exchange Abuse and Rule 13b2-5.

Wasserman used a personal account to transfer over $400,000 in corporate funds from China to the U.S. to pay the Chinese company's U.S. expenses.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Wasserman had previously engaged in the same practice with at least two other China-based public companies.  The SEC's complaint alleges that by repeatedly commingling corporate funds with his own personal funds Wasserman put the company's assets at risk for misuse and loss and, through his conduct, Wasserman knowingly failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

117,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Houston, Texas resident James C. Tao and Donna Boyd with defrauding investors in a Houston-area technology start-up fund.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2012 through 2016, Tao, who was associated with the registered firm, formed a private equity fund called PVC, LLC (PVC) to purportedly invest in the Houston area. The fund raised approximately $860,000 for the accounts of approximately 25 investors located in multiple states, and the majority of the investors were brokerage customers. As alleged, the funds were used to buy out investors, which was a clear conflict of interest for Tao. To conceal the nature of his fraud and his misappropriation of investor funds, he allegedly misrepresented to investors that investors would receive management fees from the fund and a 20% share of fund's profits as compensation. In reality, as alleged in SEC Complaint No. 17(a)(1) and (3) thereunder, all of these representations were false and misleading. For example, while Tao solicited investments in PVC on their own and without the Registered Firm's knowledge or approval, his and other associates made material misrepresentations about the use of investors' funds and failed to timely or adequately disclose that he was investing in companies that had not raised as much money as anticipated. Finally, after a personal falling-out with Tao in 2013, Boyd stopped her involvement and did not disclose the investment in her own companies or the companies she owned or in which she had a significant stake.Â  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty and an officer-and-director bar.

Investors can also check the background of","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that former financial adviser James C. Tao has agreed to settle charges that he defrauded investors in Presidio Venture Capital, a private equity fund he created and managed, by making material misstatements in offering documents and misappropriating investor funds.  Tao and his former partner, Donna Boyd (f/k/a Donna Chen), also settled charges for violating broker-dealer registration requirements by soliciting sales of interests in the funds, which were securities not offered by the brokerage firm with which they were associated at the time.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, while working as financial advisers associated with a registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, Tao and Boyd formed private equity fund PVC, LLC - which did business as Presidio Venture Capital - in 2013 primarily for the purpose of investing in technology start-ups in the Houston, Texas area.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Tao and Boyd raised approximately $860,000 for the fund between January 2013 and July 2016 by soliciting investments from their advisory clients, some of whom were also brokerage clients, and from other personal and business contacts.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Tao falsely claimed investor funds would be held in escrow and returned unless $2.5 million was raised.  The complaint further alleges that while some of the money PVC raised was invested in arms-length transactions that fit the fund's stated business model, Tao failed to timely or adequately disclose that the fund was also investing in companies he owned or in which he had a personal stake, which was a clear conflict of interest.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Tao used investor funds to apply for a loan to increase his interest in the fund, cover other expenses not in line with the use of funds disclosed in PVC's offering materials, and make a Ponzi-style payment by using new investor funds to buy out a disgruntled investor.  The complaint also alleges that Tao ignored fund redemption restrictions and bought out Boyd, who severed ties with the fund in 2013, and at least three other investors with cash from the sale of one of PVC's early investments.  The SEC's complaint charges Tao with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, alleges that, in September 2009, Dalmet, who was formerly employed as an attorney for OTC Markets Group Inc., obtained a temporary restraining order that temporarily barred her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as a lawyer, from preparing or preparing public filings with the SEC. The order, which permanently restrains her right to participate in future SEC proceedings, also requires Dalmie to provide any legal assistance or representation to a transfer agent or broker-dealer in connection with any offering of securities of a public company.

To evade the consequences of this prohibition, Dalmy allegedly recruited a retired divorce lawyer, who signed legal opinion letters drafted by Dalmy without performing due diligence or conducting any legal analysis and then sent them on to the firms.  The SEC alleges that legal opinion letters are a significant factor in transfer agents' and brokerage firms' decisions to deem certain securities eligible to be freely sold on the public market without SEC registration, and that transfer agents and brokerage firms often refuse to accept legal opinion letters from attorneys subject to OTC Markets prohibitions.  The SEC further alleges that, in 2016, Dalmy was permanently suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an attorney, which prohibited her from representing clients in SEC matters, including investigations, litigation, or examinations, and from advising clients about SEC filing obligations or content.  Despite this, the SEC alleges that Dalmy continued to prepare filings for publicly traded companies and directed the other attorney to file them with the SEC.

The SEC's complaint against Christopher K. Davies, filed April 18, alleges that he fraudulently controlled a penny stock company from behind the scenes and made false statements about its business plans and operations so he could illegally obtain millions of shares, which he planned to profit on by selling into the market.Â  The SEC's suspension of trading in the securities of the issuer in July 2016 effectively thwarted the defendant from dumping many of these shares on the market.  Davies allegedly recruited a series of strawmen to serve as CEOs of American Transportation Holdings Inc. (ATHI), which was in fact a shell company with no operations.Â  Meanwhile, according to the SEC's complaint, Davies was behind the company's frequent misleading statements about purported business ventures that ranged from home health care and gold trading to transportation services and game development.Â  Davies also allegedly orchestrated a series of press releases in June and July 2016, falsely claiming that the company had entered into agreements with a National Indoor Football League.  Following these press releases and a simultaneous promotional campaign, ATHI's share price soared from under a penny to an intraday trading high of $12, causing the market capitalization of this empty shell company to reach nearly $3 billion.  According to the SEC's complaint, Davies' scheme included setting up fake email addresses and using forged documents to cause ATHI to issue stock to entities that he and his associates controlled.  ATHI and Davies allegedly also misled a court in Florida to obtain approval for ATHI to issue shares to another company, which then sold the shares for over $100,000 and paid more than $37,000 to one of Davies' companies.  Over the course of his scheme, Davies caused ATHI to issue at least 271 million shares, potentially worth millions of dollars to entities he controlled.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Sequential failed to properly assess its goodwill for potential impairment after several months of declining stock prices followed by a precipitous drop in early November 2016.  According to the complaint, in December 2016, shortly after Sequential passed its annual goodwill testing, the company conducted internal calculations showing that, in light of the declining stock price, Sequential would fail the first step of its disclosed two-step impairment test.  The complaint alleges that the company ignored this objective evidence of impairment.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Sequential performed a qualitative analysis that omitted any mention of its internal calculations, as well as numerous other negative developments in the company's business, leading it to unreasonably conclude that goodwill was not impaired.  As alleged, by avoiding an impairment to its goodwill in 2016, Sequential inflated its income from operations, created a false impression of its financial condition, and misstated its financial statements and reports for almost a year.  Sequential allegedly continued to improperly account for goodwill in the next three quarters, before belatedly impairing all of its goodwill-totaling $304 million-in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Sequential with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and, additionally, charges Sequential with violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Sansone, fraudulently induced investors to purchase shares of the company in exchange for their participation in an offering that raised more than $2.5 million. The complaint further alleges the stock's price increased when the offer was made public and investors were encouraged to buy shares at a high price.Â The complaint also alleges, without admitting or denying the allegations, that S&P Capital Management, Inc., a New Jersey-based registered broker-dealer, and the two companies' former owners, John Rymas and Paul Gizzi, provided false information to investors about the price and volume of their stock and failed to disclose that they had engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the share price of stock in their own brokerage accounts.

According to the SEC's complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Salix and Derbyshire made false statements to analysts and investors during quarterly earnings calls by significantly understating the amount of Salix drugs that wholesaler customers held in inventory.  Salix had engaged in a long-standing practice of flooding the distribution channel by using incentives to induce customers to purchase more products, creating a short-term revenue bump but excess supply that imperiled future sales.

According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint:&nbsp; The wife and friend, who were also friends with each other, then misappropriated the information and traded on the basis of it for his own benefit by immediately purchasing the shares.Â  The illicit trading continued until the end of February, when the market for Nss MicroElectronics' shares increased significantly, resulting in approximately $2,700 in illegal profits for both defendants. In a parallel action, on February 8, 2014, Texas Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $9,038, which will be determined by the court upon motion of each of them.

The SEC alleges that James Balchan immediately bought shares of National Semiconductor stock after his wife informed him that a social event for the company's general counsel had been cancelled because he was busy working on an imminent merger.  Balchan and his wife were among the invitees to the event.  Balchan made nearly $30,000 in illicit profits when he sold his shares after Texas Instruments publicly announced its acquisition of National Semiconductor and the stock price jumped more than 75 percent.  Balchan agreed to pay nearly $60,000 to settle the SEC's charges.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, another partner at the firm where Balchan's wife worked began organizing informal client ""wine and dine"" events for the first weekend of April 2011 in honor of National Semiconductor's general counsel.  The partner was close to Balchan's wife and socially acquainted with Balchan.  The partner invited both of them to the weekend events and told them that National Semiconductor's general counsel would be in attendance.  According to the SEC's complaint, the partner called National Semiconductor's general counsel a few days before the weekend and was informed that he was working on the company's impending acquisition.  The general counsel sought the law firm's advice in dealing with certain regulatory issues arising from the deal.  He also informed the partner that, in light of the acquisition, he would be unable to attend the event that coming weekend.  When the law partner advised Balchan's wife that National Semiconductor's general counsel cancelled the client weekend because of the imminent acquisition, she shared the information with Balchan in confidence later that night in the context of discussing their weekend plans.  The SEC alleges that the very next morning, Balchan misappropriated the confidential information he learned about the acquisition and purchased 2,000 National Semiconductor shares.  A few days later, Balchan purchased 1,000 shares.  Texas Instruments issued a press release on April 4 announcing its acquisition of National Semiconductor.  Each of Balchan's National Semiconductor trades was based on inside information in violation of duties of trust and confidence that he owed to his wife.  Balchan was aware that his wife owed a duty of trust or confidence to her law firm and its clients.  The SEC's complaint charges Balchan with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Balchan has settled the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  He has agreed to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from future violations of relevant provisions of the Exchange Act, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $30,615.18, and an additional penalty equal to his profits of $29,052.39.

In a parallel criminal action, on December 21, 2019, Judge John R. Basinger entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins Jason from violating the securities registration provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,065, which is equal to his pre-judgment amount, in amounts to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest and a civil penalty, for a total of approximately $2,100,000.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.

Peltz also tipped others to trade ahead of the news, for a collective total profit of approximately $1 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, Peltz used inside information to trade Ferro securities before a March 15, 2016 news media article that Ferro had received a takeover approach from a prominent private equity firm.  The complaint alleges that Peltz placed his trades using accounts held in the names of others, including the account of a British Virgin Islands company.  Peltz further leveraged the inside information by tipping several associates who all traded Ferro within days of Peltz.  The case originated from the SEC Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.

Hirst of Oceanside, California, aided and abetted Jason Galananis's scheme to obtainundisclosed control over two investment advisers so that over $43 million of their clients' funds could be invested in sham Native American tribal bonds. According to the complaint, the defendants used the funds to fund the Tribal Bonds' issuance and to pay personal expenses, including purchasing luxury goods, paying the criminal defense costs of John and Bevans' father and mother-in-law and other business expenses. The complaint further alleges Jason Galanis enlisted the assistance of another investment adviser, a fake entity created at the direction of a U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, to orchestrate payments to a Tribal Bond indenture trust that was not registered with the SEC. In a parallel action filed in federal district court in Manhattan on September 5, 2015, unsealed on consent and without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's action, all defendants consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in alternative, ordering Jason to disgorge $16.2 million in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $160,000, against John Galais and $20,500 in disgorgement, $1,065 in pre-announcement interest, with a $10,700 penalty, from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years and from participating in a public offering of ""Technology Company"" in which he, Archer and Cooney had interests.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.","On November 14, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission added Francisco Martin of Woodland Hills, California to a civil injunctive action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging him with defrauding investors in sham Native American tribal bonds.  The SEC's amended complaint alleges that Martin, along with seven other co-defendants, participated in a scheme to convince a Native American tribal corporation affiliated with the Wakpamni District of the Oglala Sioux Nation to issue limited recourse bonds that Jason Galanis and his father, John Galanis, had already structured.  As Jason Galanis allegedly told two of his associates, the &quot;primary objective&quot; of the scheme was to provide Jason Galanis and his associates &quot;a source of discretionary liquidity.&quot;  Jason Galanis then allegedly acquired two investment advisory firms and installed officers to arrange the purchase of $43 million in bonds using clients' funds.  The amended complaint further alleges that in exchange for $150,000 from Jason Galanis, Martin served as the &quot;Managing Director&quot; or &quot;Portfolio Manager&quot; of a fake entity that was held out to bond investors as an independent investment manager for the bond proceeds.  Through his role with the fake investment manager, Martin facilitated the transfer of proceeds from investors in the tribal bonds to Jason Galanis and his associates.  The SEC further alleges that instead of investing bond proceeds as promised in annuities to benefit the tribal corporation and generate sufficient income to repay bondholders, the money wound up in a bank account in Florida belonging to a company controlled by Jason Galanis and his associates.Â  Among their alleged misuses of the misappropriated funds were luxury purchases at such retailers as Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Barneys, Prada, and Gucci, and to support an IPO of a technology company in which Jason Galanis and several other defendants had interests.

According to the SEC's complaint, from May 2015 to August 2015, the entity that was supposed to be the issuer of the bonds offered by the authority failed to disclose significant cash flow issues, including debt service issues related to a private high school, and that it was unable to make the lease payments required to repay its obligations under the agreement. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of this financial distress, it had to borrow millions of dollars from foreign investors to pay off debt owed to investors and to fund the purchase and renovation of a building to house two public charter schools operated by Cal Prep and Cal Preparatory Academies. As alleged in the complaint filed in federal court in Alameda County, Calif., the Authority acted as the sole owner and sole manager of revenue bonds sold to potential investors in 2015 and 2016, when it became insolvent and was in dire financial stra straits. In addition to these financial problems, according to one investor, Batchelor helped prepare the offering document and signed separate certifications to ensure that the information contained no material misrepresentations or omissions concerning the entities' financial condition at the time. Similarly, another investor was told in an email that ""we're still scraping by at this point.""

Additionally, one vendor denied the investors access to an important online learning tool just before the bond sale, because it is not a 501(c) or a public school.

The complaint states that Batchelor and Zukoski were aware that Tri-Valley was experiencing serious cash flow problems that negatively affected its ability to make debt service payments on the bonds, was delinquent on payments owed to vendors, had incurred additional debt in the form of a private term loan that was overdue by nearly one year, and had drawn a bank line of credit to its limit just prior to the bond sale.  However, the offering document allegedly failed to disclose that Tri-Valley was in serious financial distress at the time the bonds were sold and contained misleading financial projections.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that, despite knowing the true state of Tri-Valley's financial condition, Batchelor and Zukoski signed separate certifications that the information in the offering document contained no material misrepresentations or omissions.

Minute, when they lied to investors about how much of their money they had invested in the movie. The complaint alleges that Adams and Flemings told one investor that he and Adams had personally invested their own money and that they would use it to produce a feature film. Adams also allegedly told the investor he would not invest unless he was certain that another investor would share the profits with him. In fact, Adams allegedly provided investors with a fake email chain and forged signature page that was used to deceive investors and to convince them that the money had been spent on the film, rather than on their personal projects. As a result, at least two of the investors were falsely told that their funds had not been invested and were being used instead to pay two separate, unrelated entities that had previously been involved in a similar scheme. According the complaint further alleges Adams lied about the use of investor money, including by telling investors that investors would receive a percentage of any profits generated by the project, but that this was a ""false and misleading"" statement, that neither Adams nor his company had ever invested any money in any movie, nor did Adams or his companies receive any funds from their investments, despite repeated requests by investors to do so. Additionally, as alleged, in one email to a potential investor, he told her that she would ""invest my money"" if she had known that her money was going to be used for a casting director or a production company instead of her own personal use.

Minute LLC, using a pattern of lies and deception.  According to the complaint, Adams and Flanders falsely stated to one of the investors that they had each invested in the film and would not receive any of the funds being raised until bank financing was obtained.

The complaint further alleges that Adams and Flanders also made misrepresentations to the second investor, who said he would invest $100,000 only if $200,000 was first raised elsewhere.  According to the complaint, Flanders forwarded the investor two fabricated emails Adams had prepared containing a fictitious wire transfer confirmation and a forged signature page, to create the false appearance that $200,000 had been raised from another investor.  The complaint alleges that Adams and Flanders personally received $29,000 and $10,000, respectively, from the $100,000 investment.

The complaint also alleged that Hanan was the sole owner and control person behind the scheme, and that he was not a registered broker-dealer or a member of any registered investment advisor. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this matter, Hannahan consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provision of Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4), of which the judgment further enjoins Hannigan from participating in any future offering of securities, including offering to purchase, selling, or trading in a public company for a profit in excess of $100,000, a year after the date of his initial public offering, on which he agreed to settle the charges and pay a $1.2 million civil penalty, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by a federal district court.

In addition, in its Forms ADV and Forms ADV Part 2A, Goldsky stated that it managed over $100 million in discretionary assets under management.  Goldsky's website also claimed that Goldsky Fund earned: 19.45% compounded annual returns since inception, 70.33% compounded monthly returns since inception, and 25.30% returns for the year ended September 30, 2017.  The SEC alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Goldsky, Grace and Goldsky Fund had no agreements with service providers, Goldsky and Grace did not manage $100 million of assets, and Goldsky Fund did not have any investment returns as it never had any assets.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Goldsky and Grace with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, or in the alternative, that Grace aided and abetted Goldsky's violations.

The SEC's complaint alleges that between February 2014 and December 2016, ITEC, Marshall, and David Michael Naylor raised over $7 million from investors in Nevada and British Columbia, Canada, through fraudulent, unregistered offerings of common stock and investment contracts.

The Commission's Order finds and its complaint alleges that, from at least September 2010 through at least March 2011, Alyasin and Optima engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain and sell purportedly unrestricted shares of China North East Petroleum Holdings Limited (""CNEP"") in unregistered transactions.  Their attorney, Patterson, issued two baseless Rule 144 legal opinions, allowing the restrictive legends to be improperly removed from the securities.  Alyasin and Optima loaned $3.5 million to the former Chief Executive Officer and President and current director of CNEP (""Borrower"").  The loan was secured by a pledge of 2.5 million shares of restricted CNEP control stock.  Under the provisions of the lending agreements, Alyasin and Optima agreed not to sell those restricted shares for the term of the loan.  According to the Commission's Order and complaint, Alyasin and Optima, however, immediately took steps to remove the restrictive legends from the shares, allowing them to margin and then, in contravention of the federal securities laws and the stated terms of the lending agreements, to sell those securities into the open market.  Patterson caused this fraudulent scheme by issuing two baseless Rule 144 opinion letters incorrectly stating that the restrictive legends on the CNEP stock certificates could be removed based on the terms of the lending agreements.    By engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities, the Commission alleges in its complaint that Alyasin, Optima, and Patterson each violated the registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"").   In addition, Alyasin and Optima are alleged to have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 by engaging in the fraudulent scheme, and Patterson caused Alyasin's and Optima's violations of those antifraud provisions.

As part of his settlement with the Commission, Patterson, consented to the issuance of an order that requires him:  (1) to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (2) to pay a civil penalty of $30,000.  In addition, the order prohibits Patterson from providing professional legal services to any person or entity in connection with the offer or sale of securities, including, without limitation, participating in the preparation of any opinion letter related to such offerings; and bars him from appearing or practicing as an attorney before the Commission for ten years.    Alyasin and Optima agreed to a bifurcated settlement whereby they, without admitting or denying the allegations, consent to:  (1) the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and (2) the entry of a final judgment imposing disgorgement of ill-gotten gains along with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts, if any, to be determined by the Court upon motion of the Commission.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an officer-and-director bar against Zeino and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $1,072, which represents the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty equal to his civil penalty, plus prejudgment interest, a penny stock bar and officer and director bar. On September 18, 2015, after the stock market opened on September 20, 2016, it was suspended for one day and sold for $20.58 per share, losing nearly half the value of its market value. Zeina has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as a conduct-based injunction, with a pre-judgment amount to be determined by a court at a later date. He has also consented to permanent injunctions against future violations, including from September 2020 through March 2020, in order to participate in an offering of certain implants that is subject to court approval.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Sientra, Inc., a California-based medical aesthetics company, and its former CEO, Hani Zeini, with concealing damaging news about the company's sole-source manufacturer before it closed a $60 million stock offering in 2015.  The company agreed to settle the SEC's charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, Sientra sells silicone breast implants in the United States, and at the time of the offering, all of the implants it sold were made by a company in Brazil.  Three days before Sientra was preparing to close a stock offering for more than $60 million, Zeini allegedly learned from the Brazilian company's CEO that its Brazilian manufacturer's ""CE certificate,"" which is a sign of regulatory compliance required to sell products in the European Union, had been suspended.  Zeini allegedly concealed this information from Sientra's general counsel and the underwriters for the offering.  The day after the offering closed, news of the suspension became public, and Sientra's stock price fell 52.6% from $20.58 to $9.70 per share after it issued a release disclosing the suspension.  Even after that, Zeini allegedly lied to those asking about the matter, and tried to destroy the records that showed he knew about the CE certificate suspension.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Hani Zeini with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a penalty, an officer and director bar, and a permanent injunction.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Sientra, consented to the entry of the SEC's order, which finds Sientra violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sientra to cease and desist from future violations of these statutes.  In considering whether to accept Sientra's settlement the SEC considered Sientra's prompt action upon discovering the alleged fraud, self-reporting to the SEC, and extensive cooperation with the agency's investigation.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew Montgomery and was supervised by Robert Conrrad of the Los Angeles office.  The SEC's litigation against Mr. Zeini will be handled by Amy Longo and Matthew Montgomery.",0.5763,0.5587

Appel with manipulating the stocks of three microcap companies while on supervised release following his criminal conviction for a prior securities fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, Appel orchestrated multiple schemes to manipulate the market for trading in shares of Virtual Piggy Inc., (VPIG), Red Mountain Resources Inc. (RDMP), and Rio Bravo Oil Inc. (RIOB), and concealed his activity by using overseas associates and nominee brokerage accounts.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Appel secretly acquired ownership or control over sufficient shares of the companies so that he and his associates could manipulate their stocks through coordinated trading activity.  As alleged in the complaint, Appel kept tight control over the trading and engaged in matched trading with his associates.  In one instance, Appel allegedly sought to coordinate artificial bidding activity to prevent the price of RDMP from dropping, emailing instructions to his associates:  ""Have ur guy for 12500 at .87 and another 7500 at .85 in case we get hit by selling today. (My guy above that bidding .87).""  In another example in the complaint, Appel sold 200,000 shares of RIOB to accounts controlled by one of his associates overseas in a series of matched trades that accounted for 80 percent of the reported volume on RIOB's second day of trading.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Pennsylvania, charges Appel with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. Appel has agreed to settle the SEC's charges.  Appel will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The court will determine monetary sanctions and other relief at a later date.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, SAE and its executives, Jeffrey H. Hastings, Brent N. Whiteley, and Brian A. Beatty, used fake invoices to conceal the fraud from SAE's board of directors and the investing public. The complaint further alleges that the defendants concealed the theft of the money from the customers and used it to pay for personal expenses and to fund a series of shell companies they controlled, including a shell company that purported to be owned by a third party, Alaskan Seismic Ventures, LLC (""ASV"").  The SEC charges the four with violating the antifraud, record keeping, internal controls and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the anti-fraud and accounting provisions Section 13(d)(2)(A)(1)(B)(3)(C), and Rules 13a-14, 13d-1, 12d2-3, 14d1-4, 16d3-11, 15d13, 17d20, 18d21, 24d23, et al.

(SAE), and four former executives for a multi-year accounting fraud that falsely inflated the company's revenue by approximately $100 million and concealed the theft of millions of dollars by the executives.  SAE issued restated financial statements in February and declared bankruptcy in August.  According to the SEC's complaint, starting in 2015, SAE, at the direction of the four executives - former CEO and Chairman Jeffrey Hastings, former CFO and General Counsel Brent Whiteley, former CEO and COO Brian Beatty, and former VP of Operations Michael Scott -entered into a series of seismic data acquisition contracts totaling approximately $140 million with a purportedly unrelated Alaska-based company that was in fact controlled by Hastings and Whiteley.  The complaint alleges that, of the amount SAE recorded in revenue, approximately $100 million was improperly recorded in light of the Alaskan company's inability to pay and the SAE executives' control of the company.  As alleged in the complaint, to create the false impression that the Alaskan company was actually paying SAE for seismic data, Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott misappropriated nearly $6 million from SAE and used the funds for a series of round trip transactions that caused the money to be sent back to SAE.  The complaint alleges that, in addition, the executives also stole a total of approximately $6 million for themselves.  The complaint further alleges that Whiteley separately misappropriated an additional $4 million through a fictitious invoice scheme.  The SEC's complaint charges SAE, Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  It further charges SAE with violating Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 thereunder, and that Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott aided and abetted those violations.  Additionally, the complaint charges Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott with violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Hastings, Whiteley, and Beatty with also violating Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-14, and 13b2-2.  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against SAE and permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bars against the four executives.  Additionally, the SEC seeks to have Hastings, Whiteley, and Beatty reimburse SAE for incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

163,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a San Francisco-based investment firm and its founder with conducting a Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 200 retail investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jaswant Gill and Javier Rios raised approximately $10 million from nearly 200 investors between September 2013 and September 2014, promising guaranteed, fixed returns of up to 60 percent annually through purported investments in highly coveted, pre-IPO shares of companies such as Airbnb, Alibaba, and Uber. The complaint alleges that the defendants used investor money to pay for vacations to high-end restaurants and clubs, jaunts to Las Vegas casinos, gentlemen's clubs and luxury retail stores, as well as to make payments to earlier investors in the scheme. In reality, the Defendants falsely portrayed themselves as a ""man-and-an-a-woman"" investing in these investments, claiming that investor funds were secured by assets held at established brokerage firms and that investors were additionally secured against losses by an insurance policy. As alleged, these claims were false and misleading. For example, Gill has received at least $1.7 million in cash withdrawals, transfers to his personal bank account and the monthly rent at his own residence, while using over $500,000 in interest payments from a JSG Capital Investments, LLC investment advisory firm. Gill used additional funds for personal expenses and purchases at retailers for furniture and clothing. Finally, he allegedly used an expense account he created to repay earlier victims of the fraud to cover his lifestyle and pay earlier investor payments. Without admitting or denying the allegations, J.Rios and Gill have agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1)(A), 206 (2)(B), and 214(3)(C) in connection with the same securities offering and investment adviser previously charged by the Commission in a parallel action, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, on May 25, 2016.Â  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, a penny stock bar, an officer and director bar against Gill, joint and severally liable for any civil monetary relief.","The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged two California men and their investment firm with operating a Ponzi scheme as they purported to specialize in serving middle-class investors and securing exorbitant returns by investing in hot pre-IPO stocks. The agency also obtained a court-ordered asset freeze against them.  The SEC alleges that instead of using the firm's purported proprietary trading models and investing in pre-IPO shares of well-known tech companies like Uber, Alibaba, and Airbnb as promised to investors, Jaswant ""Jason"" Gill and Javier Rios personally pocketed at least $2.8 million in investor funds, using some of that money to pay for excursions to high-end restaurants and luxury retail stores as well as jaunts to Las Vegas casinos, gentlemen's clubs, and professional sporting events. They never actually invested in any pre-IPO shares, and have been using money from new investors to pay supposed returns to earlier investors. They have raised approximately $10 million through their firm, JSG Capital Investments, and related entities, by catering to average retail investors and promising them exclusive investment opportunities ""previously only available to the one-percenters,"" with guaranteed annual returns of up to 60 percent.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Gill in particular has brandished phony credentials, telling investors he founded his firm after serving as a managing director at Morgan Stanley.

(""Swisher""), a Charlotte, North Carolina-based hygiene and sanitation company, and its former CFO, Michael J. Kipp, with orchestrating an earnings management scheme that defrauded the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Western District of Carolina, alleges that, from at least May 2011 through December 2012, KIPP orchestrated an accounting scheme in which he and another employee, Joanne K. Viard, orchestrated a series of earnings-related accounting changes that materially overstated the value of the companies' assets and liabilities. The alleged scheme resulted in significant revenue losses for the newly-formed companies, which were then used to fund future acquisition financing. According to the complaint:   As part of this scheme, Swishers issued amended quarterly reports in 2011, including restated financial statements, to reflect adjustments to previously reported financial information, in order to meet certain of those targets.Â  The amended financial reports included accounting entries that were not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as ""fair value"" and ""bad guys"" as well as a recording of adjustments made in accordance with those accounting statements. In addition, as alleged, during the closing process for those earnings announcements, a ""hit list"" of potential positive and negative adjustments was recorded on the accounting books, indicating that the adjustments had been made to a specific set of accounting specifications and that there was a significant shortfall in accounting information.&nbsp;  In a parallel action, U.S. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced criminal charges against the defendants, who are also charged with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 14a-11 and 15(e) thereunder.

According to the SEC's complaint, during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2011, Michael J. Kipp, Swisher's former CFO, exploited Swisher's lack of effective internal controls and directed his accounting group to aggressively reevaluate and manipulate various acquisition-related reserves and expenses in order to increase earnings to predetermined targets tied to the expectations of the company's lenders as the basis for future acquisition financing.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Joanne K. Viard, Swisher's former Director of External Reporting, identified potential acquisition-related entries that could be reclassified to meet earnings targets, and made various adjusting entries in Swisher's accounting records without adequate justification or support.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that, during the closing process for fourth quarter of 2011, John Pierrard, Swisher's former Director of Financial Planning, at Kipp's direction, manipulated Swisher's allowance for doubtful accounts to increase earnings, knowing or consciously disregarding that the associated entries were not in accordance with GAAP.  The alleged earnings management scheme came to light in early 2012, before Swisher filed its Form 10-K for its 2011 fiscal year.  The SEC alleges that Kipp and Viard violated and/or aided and abetted Swisher's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that Kipp violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, respectively, and that Kipp is liable as a control person for Swisher's violations pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Kipp aided and abetted Swisher's uncharged violations of the whistleblower retaliation provisions contained in Section 21F(h) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC alleges that Pierrard violated Sections 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Pierrard has agreed to settle the SEC's claims against him by consenting to the entry of a final judgment providing permanent injunctive relief against violating any of the statutes or rules he is alleged to have violated.  As part of his settlement, Pierrard also consented to an officer and director bar.  The final judgment does not impose a civil penalty based on Pierrard's cooperation.

Romer, III, a registered representative associated with CoreCap Investments, LLC, persuaded at least 30 of his customers to sell securities in their accounts and transfer their proceeds to either P&R Capital, LP or Core Cap Solutions, for a total of $4.4 million, including $714,000 to cover his personal expenses, and $41,500 to family members. According to the SEC, in exchange for his assistance in this fraud, he would invest their money in a stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments. The complaint further alleges, however, that he did not invest the customers' funds for their benefit. Instead, Romers commingled the customer funds and used the money to repay other customers at his brokerage firms, who had suffered losses from a private offering in 2010 and 2011. As alleged, most of the victims were retirees and unsophisticated investors who were not invested in corecap investments and were more likely to lose money due to their retirement savings. In addition, some customers received Ponzi-like payments, using money he received from his victims. Some customers transferred funds to others for personal purposes, such as credit card bills and shopping, college costs, or college tuition.

Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked.  Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false.  As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least January 2013 to March 2014, Robert A. McShane, a co-founder and former chief executive officer of a New Jersey-based investment advisory firm, orchestrated a scheme to manipulate the stock price and volume of an investment adviser's common stock and other affiliated companies. The scheme allegedly generated approximately $2.3 million of illicit profits, which the complaint alleges was used to fund the company's lavish lifestyle, including lavish lifestyles, lavish parties, and lavish living expenses. In a parallel action, on September 26, 2014 and unsealed on October 10, 2016, McSHane pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $7,895, representing a total of approximately 17.8 million. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this case, McGlynn consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

One of the brokers agreed to pay more than $400,000 to settle the charges.  Brokers must make recommendations that are compatible with their customers' financial needs, investment objectives, and risk tolerances.  An SEC examination of the firm Alexander Capital L.P. detected potential misconduct among certain brokers, and the ensuing investigation has led to the filing of an SEC complaint against William C. Gennity and Rocco Roveccio.  The SEC also issued an order against Laurence M. Torres.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gennity and Roveccio recommended investments that involved frequent buying and selling of securities without any reasonable basis to believe their customers would profit.  According to the complaint, since customers incur costs with every transaction, the price of the security must increase significantly during the brief period it is held in an account for even a minimal profit to be realized.  The SEC further alleges that Gennity and Roveccio churned customer accounts, engaged in unauthorized trading, and concealed material information from their customers - namely that the transaction costs associated with their recommendations (commissions, markups, markdowns, postage, fees, and margin interest) would almost certainly outstrip any potential monetary gains in the accounts.  According to the SEC's complaint, customer losses totaled $683,038 while Gennity and Roveccio received approximately $280,000 and $206,000, respectively, in commissions and fees.  The SEC's order against Torres finds that he had no reasonable basis to believe it was suitable to recommend a high-cost pattern of frequent trading that gave his customers virtually no chance of making even a minimal profit.  Torres also engaged in churning and made unauthorized trades.  Without admitting or denying the findings, Torres agreed to be barred from the securities industry and penny stock trading, and he must pay $225,359.36 in disgorgement plus $25,748.02 in interest, and a $160,000 penalty.

According to the SEC's complaint, in a four-year period, from 2013 to 2017, defendants made approximately $60 million in Ponzi payments to investors and used investor funds to make POOSTS to themselves and to pay their personal expenses, including rent, luxury cars, watches, and a down payment on a $3.5 million home. The complaint also alleges that, over the course of at least two years, N go and Bacca converted virtually all of the investors' funds, using them to repay investors who were convinced to invest the money into the company's lavish lifestyle. In reality, they used virtually no actual wholesale business activity, instead using virtually every penny of investor money for their extravagant lifestyles. As a result, many investors recommended the investment to family and friends, who also invested the funds. BacÃ¡nÂsÂ interest rate is typically between 5% and 15% per year, depending on the amount of money raised.

As alleged, as part of these offerings, Cap Source and Byrne assisted an Arizona businessman with financing his drug rehabilitation business and secured by a subsidiary of Company A. According to the SEC&rsquo;s website&nbsp;;), the principals knew that the company was diverting millions of dollars of proceeds raised through the offering to fund other projects for Individual 1, and were reckless in not knowing that they were divertling the funds to other investors. In addition to misappropriating the investors' money, some of the proceeds were used to pay personal guaranties on unrelated projects, such as a $7 million home loan that was due to be repaid in due course. The defendants also allegedly lied to investors about the extent of their losses and failed to disclose that their principal was in default on the loans owed to them.Â  The complaint charges the Defendants with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the complaints, CapSource, Byrne, and Herlean knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Zipprich was keeping ARC's primary treatment facility afloat by improperly diverting to ARC millions of dollars raised through CapSource for various other projects he managed.  The complaints further allege that Zipprich defrauded investors by raising approximately $10 million in additional funds through CapSource purportedly to pay for future renovations to ARC's primary treatment facility, while instead using a substantial amount of those proceeds to partially repay and conceal the previous diversion of investors' funds.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, from at least August 2016 through November 2017, Mill and Cabrera raised approximately $1.4 million from investors who were lured to the scheme by the promise of returns of up to 60% from the initial investment of an investment.  In reality, as alleged, these investors were not registered as brokers and received substantial compensation from Airbit for selling the investment in its products and services, and the promoters received no compensation for their promotion and sales of the investments in connection with their marketing efforts. The complaint further alleges, in a promotional video posted to social media, that the defendants each solicited new investors through a network of online recruitment efforts, including YouTube videos and investment presentations.Â  The defendants' promotional efforts were in both Spanish and English and targeted the Latino and Latino communities for investment and retail investors, who often relied on the recruitment of others to fund their investment plans and to reap significant profits from selling their investments. In a parallel action the U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern California today announced criminal charges against the two defendants, charging them with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 15(b)(2).  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $10,000 and a civil penalty of over $600,00, which is equal to disgorge the amount of allegedly ill-gotten gains received in their respective criminal cases.

According to the SEC's complaint, Neil Burkholz and Frank Bianco, the co-founders of Palm Financial Management, LLC (Palm Management) and Shore Man agement Systems (collectively, ""Defendants""), fraudulently misappropriated investor assets by diverting them to pay other investors and by transferring funds to themselves and their spouses. The complaint alleges that the defendants falsely represented to investors that Palm Management's assets would be invested in the Shore Fund in a manner consistent with their representations in fund documents and other oral and written communications. Instead, as alleged, they used the funds for personal expenses, including paying purported investment returlzs and redemptions to earlier investors. In September, one investor obtained $123,00 from a new investor whose entire life savings had been invested by the fund. According the complaint:  The defendants continued to solicit new investors despite knowing that most of the money was being diverted to their personal accounts and used to make payments on earlier investor's behalf. To conceal their misconduct and trading losses, defendants allegedly provided investors with weekly updates in which they claimed massive weekly, monthly, and yea rly positive returns and, on several occasions, claimed that investor funds had either been misused or lost. As a result of their fraud, most investors have lost over $1.49 million in assets, which is more than half of what they were investing. Additionally, some victims have liquidated their retirement savings and assets and transferred their money to other people, while others invested their entire lives savings to fund their own living expenses and to support their lifestyle. For example, in one instance, when confronted by an investor in September 2019, he told the investor that he had ""invested $84,000 in investment funds"" and ""had invested $140,500 in investments."" The investor replied, without admitting or denying the allegations, that she had invested the entire amount of her husband's money into a brokerage account and had not invested it in any other account at the time of his alleged fraud. On the other hand, she allegedly received $5,727 in investor proceeds in an August 2019 letter from an acquaintance she met while on vacation in Thailand.

In reality, as alleged in the complaint, defendants invested less than half of investor funds, and those investments resulted in near-total losses.  The complaint alleges that defendants misappropriated the remaining funds by using them to repay other investors and by transferring approximately $880,000 of investor funds to themselves and their spouses for personal use.

The complaint further alleges, among other things, that defendants falsely told investors that their money would be used to fund the companies' operations, and instead it was used for personal expenses, such as meals and entertainment expenses. In fact, as alleged, most of the money actually went directly to the investors, rather than the company's own accounts, which were intended to pay the promised profits to shareholders.Â The complaint also alleges defendants lied about the amount of money they received and failed to disclose that the funds they raised were used only for the purpose of selling the stock of a single company, not for any specific purpose other than to give investors the impression that they were being paid for their investment. According to these false statements, investors' money was being used by the same company to make Ponzi-like payments to their friends and family members, who were then secretly recording the transactions and selling them on the internet to boost their own stock prices and thereby give them an appearance of being successful at the high end of their pyramid schemes.
