According to the SEC's complaint, Craig Arsenault, Atlas Capital Management, Inc. and ACT Global Investments LLC defrauded several of his advisory client clients by falsely claiming that their funds were invested in secured short-term bridge loans to doctors. The complaint alleges that, from at least January 2014 to November 2018, Arsonault told his clients that he would use their money to make secured loan payments to, for example, a used car dealer. Instead, he told them that the investments were not generating the income reported in the monthly account statements, and that they would be used to repay loans owed to existing borrowers. Arsault also allegedly told the clients in advance of investing in ACT that these investments would generate substantial interest income. In fact, the complaint further alleges, as alleged in more detail below:  The SEC has obtained a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties and injunctive relief against the defendants, plus prejudgment interest against each of the parties, in addition to a civil penalty against one of them for violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a) and 206(2) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that Arsenault and ACT used client funds instead to make unsecured loans to, for example, a used car dealership, and to acquire undeveloped real estate. As alleged in to the complaint, Arsenault then provided clients with deceptive account statements that made it appear as if these investments were generating substantial income when they were not. The SEC also alleges that Arsenault misappropriated and misused over $1 million of the client money invested in ACT.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges Arsenault, Atlas, and ACT with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Arsenault and Atlas with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

2,"On December 10, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Jared Jeffrey Davis and Dale Burke Pinchot of Yardley, Pennsylvania, with engaging in a fraudulent binary options trading scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, alleges that between 2012 and 2016, Davis, through his company, OptionMint, LLC, engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale of binary option securities to investors. According to the SEC, from at least early 2012 through June 2016 (the Relevant Period), the company paid approximately $10 million in investor funds to two companies that offered and sold binary futures to customers. The complaint further alleged that Davis instructed the companies to disseminate fake trading results to their customers in an effort to get them to enter into the trades, while neither was registered as either a broker or a dealer nor while either was associated with a brokerage or dealer. In other words, in order to generate meaningful and ongoing revenue for the Company, it required customers to be the counterparty to trade in securities that would increase the odds of customer success, and to deposit additional funds into their account. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission's allegations, V. Davis agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 17(a) and 5(c), and orders him to pay disgorgement of his or her ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties of $1,000, $500, or $100, which he will disgorge from each investor's account, plus prejudgment interest of a portion of that amount, payable to Davis at a later date, to another entity, such as an investment company or to an account controlled by Davis.

After Davis's temporary restraining order was entered, he agreed not to further violate the antifraud provisions of Section 17.a. of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as to cease and desist from violating the registration provisions and other relevant federal securities laws of 1934 and the securities regulations of those same periods.

According to the complaint, Davis misrepresented the number of investors who successfully traded binary options and failed to disclose that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of trades. The complaint alleges that Davis, Pinchot, and their companies effectively took the opposing position on each trade and therefore made money when customers entered into losing binary options trades.

According to the SEC's complaint, between at least 2012 and early 2016, the company, SpotFN, and a number of related companies, falsely claimed that investors' funds would be held in segregated accounts and used only for trading options. In reality, investors suffered losses of approximately $4 million from investors, some of whom were senior citizens without in vestment experience. The SEC further alleges that, in fact, many of the investors lost money by making more trades on the spotFN website and other related websites, which falsely stated that an investor's funds were being used for the trading of options, not for a company's business expenses. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or providing any evidence of fraud or other violations of Section 17(a)(2)(A) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, there was no registration statement for such an offering or sale and no exemption from the registration requirements for other securities laws. Additionally, according to these SEC documents, when investors placed a losing trade, they typically received 70-80% of their amount of that trade. When the investor withdrew their funds, their account balance was depleted and they were unable to withdraw any significant amount from their accounts. Finally, after several failed attempts to recover their invested funds through a combination of fraudulent marketing and fraud tactics, a final judgment was entered that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations.

Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds. Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds. As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses.

The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had ""worked his way up through the oil fields"" and had been in the industry during his ""whole adult life."" However, Forrester's work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee.  Last year, the SEC charged David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use. In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme. For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.

8,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a Newport Beach, California resident and his company, Environmental Packaging Technologies Holdings, Inc., a Swiss company run by Roger Knox.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Morrie Tobin, Patel, Ledvina, and Daniel Lacher engaged in a deceptive scheme to sell publicly traded stock to investors. According to the complaint, from approximately June 2013 to approximately July 2017, Tobinn and the company's board of directors secretly controlled two public companies. In reality, these companies were controlled by a third party, not by the public company itself. As alleged in the SEC’s complaint in federal court in Boston, the defendants used a network of nominee entities and individuals to secretly hold Tobins' shares, arranging for offshore asset managers to deposit those shares with brokers in blocks constituting less than 5% of CURE's outstanding shares. Without disclosing accurate information about the ownership and control of the companies, they sold their shares without registering the offers or sales of stock with the Commission. The defendants also used shell companies to conceal their control over the two companies and to obstruct the investigation of possible violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 10(b)(1), (2), and 9(c)(3)(A), which prohibit the trading of shares by individuals or entities other than the listed company. Finally, in an effort to avoid detection of potential securities fraud, defendants agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penalties and injunctive relief from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and other federal agencies, as well as to a temporary restraining order halting the sale of securities to individuals and entities that were not directly involved in this scheme.","The Securities and Exchange Commission charged four individuals for their roles in a scheme to profit from the manipulation and illegal sale of stock of two publicly traded companies, Environmental Packaging Technologies Holdings, Inc. and CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp.  According to the SEC's complaint, Morrie Tobin, a California resident, worked with co-defendants Milan Patel, Matthew Ledvina, and Daniel Lacher to facilitate Tobin's scheme. Patel and Ledvina, attorneys at an international tax law firm, and Lacher, a resident of Switzerland, allegedly hid Tobin's ownership and control over the companies by using offshore entitites to hold his stock and by establishing accounts to sell that stock at Wintercap SA, a Swiss-based company run by U.K. citizen Roger Knox. On October 2, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an asset freeze against Knox and Wintercap, charging them with a scheme that generated more than $165 million of illegal sales of stock in at least 50 microcap companies.  The SEC's complaint charges that to maximize profits from the alleged scheme, the defendants arranged to pay a stock promoter to tout the stock of Environmental Packaging while creating the impression that the recommendation came from a neutral third party. Environmental Packaging shares more than doubled, from approximately $1.05 per share to $2.21 per share, during the promotional campaign. Patel, Ledvina, and Lacher allegedly planned to collect a percentage of the proceeds from the unlawful sales.  According to the complaint, after the SEC halted trading in the securities of Environmental Packaging on June 27, 2017, the defendants took steps to obstruct the SEC's investigation - and conceal their own involvement in the matter - by arranging to change the names listed on Wintercap account records.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts, charges Tobin, Patel, Ledvina, and Lacher with violating various federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act.

9,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Giga Entertainment Media, Inc., Gary Nerlinger, Lawrence Silver, Alfred Colucci, and Jarret Streiner of Glenolden, Pennsylvania.  The SEC's complaint alleges that between 2012 and 2017, the company and its co-defendant, Gary Nerlinger (Giga), engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the growth of downloads of SELFEO, a mobile app for Apple and Android devices. According to the complaint, after the end of 2016, Giga stopped running user acquisition campaigns for the app and instead relied on paid third-party ""user acquisition"" campaigns to generate revenue. The complaint further alleges, over the course of several years, NERlinger and Silver lied to investors about the success of their app's downloads and misled them about how high they were. In addition, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, between May 2016 and June 2017 Gige and Nerling lied when asked by an auditor and prospective underwriter about their role in the scheme. Additionally, they allegedly misled existing and potential investors by falsely claiming that the vast majority of these downloads were generated via paid user acquisitions. Finally, in an effort to hide the fraud from investors and other third parties, including the SEC’s auditor, Underwriter and Secretary of the Investment Relations Committee, as well as the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC filing, Defendants agreed to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $325,000 and civil penalties of a combined $1.2 million. GIGA, Silver and Coluci also agreed not to violate the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and 5(c) of those federal securities laws and to disgorge the amount they misappropriated from their investors. As alleged in SEC filings, however, this settlement is subject to court approval and is being supervised by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.","The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged Giga Entertainment Media Inc. and five of its former officers and directors-Gary Nerlinger, Jarret Streiner, Lawrence Silver, Alfred Colucci, and Charles Noska-with fraud in connection with a scheme to mislead investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, between February and August 2016, the company bought at least 559,662 downloads from outside marketing firms to boost the profile of the company's mobile app, SELFEO. These firms provided Giga with a shortcut to propel its app to the top of the Apple Store download rankings. But instead of disclosing the real cause of the app's artificial meteoric rise, the company misled its shareholders into believing that this success was due to traditional marketing tactics like billboards and radio advertisements. The complaint alleges that when the company stopped paying for downloads in August 2016, the app's rankings on the Apple Store plummeted. Rather than come clean about the fact that the spike in downloads was a result of paid download campaigns, the company, Nerlinger, Streiner, and Colucci lied and told shareholders that the number of downloads continued to grow at the same high rate. Further, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, and Noska lied and falsified documents to conceal Nerlinger's role as Giga's de facto CEO to prevent the investors from discovering his prior criminal conviction for mail fraud.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, charges: (i) Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Noska with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Streiner with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and aiding and abetting Giga's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; and (iv) Giga with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the findings, Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, Noska, and Streiner consented to the entry of an SEC order finding that they violated the antifraud provisions, and a finding that Giga violated registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Colucci and Noska each agreed to a $25,000 penalty, and Streiner agreed to a $15,000 penalty. In addition, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci each agreed to a permanent officer and director bar, and Streiner agreed to a five-year bar. The settlements are subject to court approval. The court will determine what penalty Silver will pay and what disgorgement and penalty Nerlinger will pay.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Christopher R. Mathews and Edward B.

10,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleging that Gaylen Dean Rust, an individual, solicited investors to invest in a scheme involving the trading of silver bullion.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Rust and his company, Rust Rare Coin, Inc., a Utah corporation, engaged in various silver trading programs since at least January 1, 2017. According to the complaint, in the fall of 2017 Rust began soliciting investors from across the country to trade in silver futures. In the spring of 2018, he told one prospective investor that he was storing almost $80 million of investor silver at Brink's Global Services USA. The investor funds were then transferred to Rust's related entities and used to make payments to earlier investors, who were not accredited within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Rust also told the investor he had ""zero or no silver reserves"" and was using the funds for a variety of undisclosed purposes, including paying for his personal businesses and on himself and the family members he raised through the silver trade program. He also allegedly told an investor in his worst trading month that his average trading returns for the program were 20% to 25% a year. Without admitting or denying the allegations of these allegations, Mr. Whipple and Ms. Oliver agreed to a permanent injunction that permanently enjoins Rust from future violations of Sections 5(a)(2) and (c) of Section 10(b)(3) thereunder and Rule 10b-5(A), (b), and(c). The court also ordered Rust to pay disgorgement of $85.7 million plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a $250,000 civil penalty, as well as an officer-and-director bar against him from serving as a director or officer of a public company for violating the antifraud provisions of those provisions.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Utah-based company and its principal in an ongoing investment scheme that has defrauded hundreds of investors in several states.  The SEC alleges that Gaylen D. Rust and his company Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (RRC) are engaged in an ongoing investment scheme involving a purported silver trading program. Through this scheme, Rust and RRC have allegedly raised over $85 million since January 2017. According to the SEC, Rust told investors that he has access to a trading algorithm that enables him to capitalize on fluctuations in the price of silver bullion and thereby make profitable trades, regardless of the actual price of silver. He also told investors that he stores millions of tons of physical silver on behalf of investors at Brink's Global Services U.S.A. Inc. Rust claimed that his silver trading program results in average annual returns of 20% to 25%, with some years experiencing significantly higher returns. Rust also told investors that his silver trading program has almost no risk. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Rust has been using new investor funds to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for his personal expenses and the business expenses of other entities he controls.

According to the SEC's complaint, SeeThruEquity, LLC, Ajay Tandon, and his brother, Amit, defrauded investors in connection with the creation and publication of a research report on a small and microcap company.  The SEC alleges that from at least 2011 through 2016, the Tandons used a proprietary quantitative model to determine the price targets for the companies covered by their research reports. In addition, from approximately early 2016 to December 2017, they allegedly inflated the prices of the securities for which they published their reports and made other false statements and omissions, repeatedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the SEC's complaint, SeeThruEquity LLC and brothers Ajay and Amit Tandon camouflaged the payments by inviting companies to make a ""presentation"" at an investor conference in order to receive a research report for free.  SeeThru and the Tandons allegedly collected up to several thousand dollars in conference presentation fees per company, and the issuers regularly had input into the substance of the supposedly unbiased research reports, even including the price targets at times. The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru's reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock.  The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.  According to the SEC's complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure.  ""There is a clear line between paid advertising and unbiased research coverage, and we allege that SeeThru and its co-founders crossed it to deceive investors and make money,"" said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office.  ""According to our complaint, Ajay Tandon even scalped multiple issuers, further revealing the biased nature of SeeThru's research reports.""

15,"On September 27, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Florida-based marketers with engaging in a massive fraud involving the offer and sale of binary options.  According to the SEC's complaint, Timothy Atkinson and his company, All In Publishing, LLC, and Jay Passerino, of Portland, Oregon, conducted numerous online marketing campaigns that fraudulently solicited and induced hundreds of thousands of prospective investors to open and fund unregistered, off-exchange binary option accounts. The SEC alleges that Atkinson, who was the company’s sole owner and president, wrote scripts for the promotional videos that purported to generate large profits for investors who opened and funded accounts using the free software trading program. Atkinson also allegedly directed and produced videos to promote the software, which was purportedly capable of generating large amounts of money from investors. In fact, Atkinson allegedly used his own personal data to make the marketing videos, including his wife, Shmuel Pollen, a registered agent in the U.S. and Canada, to deceive investors into opening and funding accounts with him. As a result of these campaigns, approximately 50,000 investors deposited with brokers an aggregate of approximately $12.5 million to fund their own account. Over the next two years, more than a third of those investors opened accounts and closed accounts, earning substantial sums of additional money through fraudulent marketing materials. On the other hand, over the same period, about a quarter of the investors invested their money in binary futures accounts that were not registered or controlled by the Marketing Defendants. These investors also received commissions from the marketers for their brokerage services, such as auto insurance, credit card companies, cash management companies and other financial services companies that they used to purchase and sell securities. Some investors eventually lost their funds, while others lost interest in their accounts due to fraudulent trading practices.

According to the SEC's complaints, investors were conned out of tens of millions of dollars through these marketing campaigns, which promised that investors would make large amounts of money by opening binary options accounts and using free or secret software systems to trade in them. The SEC alleges that the marketers were paid for each new brokerage account that investors opened and funded. According to the complaints, the marketers' internet video advertisements, which were disseminated through spam emails, used actors to portray ordinary people who became millionaires by trading binary options. The videos staged fake demonstrations of supposed software users watching their account balances grow in real time. The SEC alleges that the software was simply a ruse to persuade investors to open accounts with the brokers.  The SEC's complaints charged 10 individuals and two companies involved in the fraudulent marketing campaigns. The SEC alleged that Timothy Atkinson, All In Publishing, LLC, Ronald Montano, Antonio Giacca, Travis Stephenson, Grayson Brookshire, and Justin Blake Barrett violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"").

The complaint also alleges the defendants engaged in other violations, including failing to properly register as a dealer in CFDs. In one instance, they allegedly used the website to solicit investors' interest in securities that track the price of a publicly-traded stock, such as the common stock of GoPro Inc. (GPRO). In another example, a person who purchased a security based swap from a registered broker in Austria purchased the same security in exchange for a profit, but did not use the brokerage's platform to make the purchase or sale of any security at all. As alleged in the complaint in SEC court documents, this is a violation of federal law and is subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations in court, 1 Broker agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins the company from future violations of these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $1,000, which is equal to the amount the defendant will disgorge and pay in civil penalties of up to $2,500.

The SEC alleges that a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity, successfully purchased several security-based swaps on 1Broker's platform from the U.S. despite not meeting the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws.

The complaint alleges that from at least January 2012 through February 2018, he used the account to make trades in pharmaceutical companies Baxalta, Inc. (BXLT) and Celgene Corp. (""CELG"") without disclosing to any of these customers that he planned to purchase stock in the biotechnology company. In addition, the complaint further alleges, in violation of Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 10(b)(3)(A)(2)(B) in connection with the purchase and sale of securities in these companies. Without admitting or denying the allegations in court documents, Bressedman agreed to pay a total of $1,914 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a national securities exchange for a period of five years, from participating in any future trading activity. He also agreed not to receive any commission for violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 15(1)(C) or 15.2(D)(4)(E)(5), or any combination thereof, of any federal securities laws, or of other federal asset-laundering provisions, including Section 20(c) (b)(d) with respect to certain customer accounts and (e)favored accounts, as well as to disgorge the remaining $10,078.04 in unsecured interest and a penalty amount of approximately $7,500, which is equal to his civil penalty.","The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New Jersey-based broker with misusing his access to customers' brokerage accounts to enrich himself and family members at the expense of his customers, many of whom entrusted him with their retirement accounts. The SEC uncovered the alleged fraud with data analysis used to detect suspicious trading patterns.  The SEC filed fraud charges in federal district court against Michael A. Bressman of Montville, New Jersey, alleging that he misused his access to an omnibus or ""allocation"" account to obtain at least $700,000 in illicit trading profits over a six-year period ending in February. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bressman placed trades using the allocation account and cherry-picked profitable trades, which he then transferred to his own account and the account of two family members, while placing unprofitable trades in other customers' accounts. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Bressman.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, charges Bressman with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and a related SEC antifraud rule.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Southern District of California, alleges that, from January 2013 through January 2017, Leroy Young and YCM, a self-employed attorney, solicited investors from multiple states through the social network LinkedIn. Young allegedly told investors that he would use their money for fees associated with a bond or hedge fund offering, and that his principal would be held in an escrow account and be returned to him if the bond offering did not occur. According to the SEC, in violation of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws and Rule 10b-5 thereunder Young lied to investors about his relevant experience and industry access and how he could generate returns of ten times their principal in sixty days. In fact, he never used the investors' money on personal expenses, such as dining, shopping, entertainment, or entertainment. The complaint also alleges Young violated Section 10(b) and 5(c)(2) in connection with the fraudulent and unregistered offering of securities. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other court proceeding, Defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, interest and penalties of up to ten percent, as well as a civil penalty of one-third of a million dollars and a bar against Young for violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, et al.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. According to the SEC's complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings. In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments.  Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450. The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval. Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan. According to the SEC's orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young's investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty.

25,"On September 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a registered representative with defrauding at least 30 of his retail brokerage customers out of approximately $2.7 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that Ernest J. Romer, III, of Shelby Township, Mich., began selling securities in his brokerage accounts and transferring the proceeds to two companies he worked with, CoreCap Investments, Inc. and P&R Capital Solutions, LLC. According to the SEC, from approximately 2014 through 2016, some of the customers' funds were invested in a variable annuity and told others they would invest their money in stocks or mutual funds. Some of those customers were elderly and unsophisticated investors, who had most of their life sa vings invested with the company. The complaint further alleges, in addition to engaging in undisclosed outside business activities in connection with this fraudulent scheme, that over the course of several years, many of these customers purchased securities from their brokerage firms and used the money for their own personal use, including paying for personal expenses, paying rent, medical bills, shopping, college costs, and other expenses. In total, over $4.4 million was misappropriated from the account of one customer. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other court proceeding, Romers has agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, as well as a penalty of $302,000 to family members. He has also agreed not to be charged with violating Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to a permanent injunction against him from future violations of that same Act.

Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC. Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments. Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked. Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false. As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit. He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

26,"On September 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company and its former CFO with misleading investors about its flagship lung cancer drug.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, charges Clovis Oncology, Inc., Patrick Mahaffy, and Erle Mast with violating the antifungal drug safety and efficacy reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that, from approximately July 8, 2015 through November 16, 2016, Clivis disclosed to investors that it had developed a drug called rociletinib, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of non-small cell lung disease (NSCLC) and that the drug's efficacy was 60 percent. According to the SEC, after learning of this information, they continued to cite the data they had received from the FDA, including from TIGER-X, telling the market that Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. As alleged in the Complaint, these statements were false and misleading. In addition, in a parallel action, a Denver-area court granted a preliminary injunction against the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from future violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties and injunctive relief. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants agreed to a permanent injunction and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any company or entity in connection with the pending approval or acquisition of such a company. Additionally, defendants agreed not to participate in future SEC filings or to any other entity's activities, such as the solicitation of securities for sale or the issuance of stock in exchange for cash or a share in any future securities offering or offering. Defendants also agreed that they will not be liable for any civil penalties or other relief arising from this action.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company's developmental lung cancer drug.  The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug. According to the complaint, the company's investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally. Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent. The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, in evaluating Clovis' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its ""efficacy,"" or how well the drug worked. In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci's efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company's CFO at that time, showed that Roci's efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent. Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward. In November 2015, after Clovis disclosed the true efficacy, using the methodology required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its stock price dropped approximately 70 percent.  The SEC's complaint charges Clovis with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint charges Mahaffy with violating Section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting Clovis' violations of Section 13(a). The complaint charges Mast with aiding and abetting Clovis' federal securities laws violations. The defendants agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and the settlements are subject to court approval. Clovis agreed to a $20 million penalty. Mahaffy agreed to a $250,000 penalty. Mast agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and to provide disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $454,145, attributable to selling Clovis stock during the relevant period at inflated prices. The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalties to harmed investors.

In addition, defendants will pay a civil penalty of over $160,000, which is substantially less than the amount alleged by the SEC in its complaint. As a result, investors will be barred from purchasing or selling any securities that are not registered under the federal securities laws and will not be able to make any payments to their own bank accounts. Additionally, they will have the option to request an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations, including those arising from the alleged fraudulent use and misuse of investors' funds.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against the former owner of a Texas-based investment education franchise for lying to dozens of investors in connection with a multimillion dollar offering fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, Defendant Thomas J. Caufield convinced more than 40 investors to invest over $6 million in his high-yield promissory notes by promising investors significant returns generated from the revenues of what he claimed was a profitable franchise. Caufield allegedly used a combination of false pitches and offering materials to lure investors, who included both students of the franchise and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC-a former state-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield. According to the complaint, Caufield misled investors about the franchise's bleak financial condition, used new investor money to repay earlier investors, and falsely claimed that investors' notes were secured by assets.

The final judgment orders disgorgement of $614,815.14 plus prejudgment interest of $126,032.11, both of which will be deemed satisfied by proceeds repaid to certain investors from Caufield's 2018 sale of the franchise. Caufield also agreed to a $160,000 civil penalty and will be barred from further association with certain regulated entities.  The SEC's investigation was led by Robert C.

The SEC alleges that after learning of the impending acquisition, Chen used the Wang account's confidential information to conduct multiple insider trades. In one instance, he purchased, at a cost of $5,507.68, 100 58.com call options, which he sold using nearly the entire cash balance in the account. After learning about the pending acquisition in advance of its public announcement on September 27, 2013, Wang and Chen agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of nearly $94,400.

Contrarian was one of a number of organizations formed pursuant to a 2015 Nevada state law that, for the first time, allowed Nevada-based entities to collect and pool money from investors anywhere in the world for purposes of sports wagering. Entities like Contrarian promoted their investment opportunities as functioning like mutual funds.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of Nevada, in 2015 Nevada passed a law allowing entities to solicit and collect funds from individual investors anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, place wagers on certain sporting events, and split the wagering profits among the investors. In 2016 and 2017, Contrarian raised over $400,000 from more than 30 investors. Contrarian conducted a general solicitation by widely offering its investment opportunity on the internet and further failed to make a determination regarding whether all of its investors were accredited.  The Complaint charges Contrarian with conducting an unregistered offering of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission accepted Contrarian's offer of settlement in which, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, it consented to the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requiring it to send a copy of the final judgment to each investor.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2014 through 2015, Goldberg and INOH Corp. falsely claimed to be in the business of searching for salvaged oil and gas deposits. The complaint alleges that Goldberg was in fact the company's chief financial officer and director. In fact, according to Goldberg, he had never agreed to serve as an officer or director of an independent company, and neither did he know that the companies' stock price was inflated by the false statements. Goldberg also knew that investors would be misled if they bought shares of the stock based on the inaccurate statements, which Goldberg knew from his position as CEO of Inovations and did not disclose to investors. Instead, investors purchased their shares after realizing that they were worth more than $1,000 each. As alleged in this Complaint, in violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, it is unlawful to sell a stock in an unregistered company without admitting or denying the allegations of fraud.

The complaint alleges that from at least 2014 through July 2017, the company raised over $287 million from over 3 million investors, many of whom used their retirement funds to finance personal expenses such as a luxury vacation to Greece and monthly payments for a Mercedes Benz. In addition, it alleged that the Company promised a high-return, low-risk investment in which it would use investor funds for its own use, including paying operating expenses and purchasing already-distressed, term credit card debt. Instead, investors were told that it only approved loans to one out of every ten merchants who applied for an MCA. According the complaint further alleges, Ruderman and his sales representatives made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in connection with the alleged scheme. For example, in one instance, one of the sales agent's statements to an investor stated that ""the average loan amount of a merchant borrower would be approximately $68,000."" In another instance the same day, another sales representative falsely claimed the average loans amount to be $40, which was $7,500.

The complaint also alleges that MacColl lied and used high pressure sales tactics to solicit customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after alternative private fund investment. According to the SEC, between approximately 2008 and March 2018 he used nearly a quarter-million dollars of customers' funds to make Ponzi-like payments to certain of the customers, who trusted him completely to manage their investments. In addition, he lied to his customers about the value of their funds and told them that they could diversify their portfolio s, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and have invest ment growth potential that was better than the securities they held at Broker-Dealer A.

Maccoll told his customers that the purported fund investment would allow them to diversify their portfolios, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and give them investment growth potential that was better than the growth they received in their brokerage accounts. As alleged in the complaint, Maccoll's statements to his customers were false - he did not invest the customers' money but stole it for his own personal use. In total, the customers invested nearly $4 million in the fraudulent scheme. To conceal the scheme, Maccoll allegedly instructed his customers not to tell others about the purported fund investment, provided some of his customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns, and paid over $400,000 in Ponzi-like payments to certain of the customers to keep the scheme alive.

According to the SEC's complaint, John A. Paulsen and Deborah D. Kelley, a registered representative at the broker-dealer, planned a ski trip to Park City, Utah for the purpose of entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. The complaint alleges that, from early 2014 until February 2016, Kang solicited and received improper gifts and entertainment from his former co-defendant. In exchange, he directed public pension trades to Kelley and her girlfriend, who earned sizable commissions. After learning of the alleged scheme in advance of Kang's arrival, Kelley began to lie to her colleagues about the fact that Kang was on the trip. Later, when the Broker-Dealer discovered inconsistencies in the expense reports and began an internal investigation, it discovered that the Fund had very strict rules which prohibited him from accepting anything from the fund's representatives, and that he sought reimbursement of those expenses by submitting false expenses reports, including those for Rolling Stones concert tickets valu ed at $1,200 from an analyst at an investment advisory firm. To avoid disclosing the scheme to other investors, however, they continued their efforts to conceal their violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1)(A)(2)(B) of Securities Act of 1933 and Section 17-a-1(c)(3), and to deceive the internal investigators into the extent to which they had violated those provisions. Finally, Paulson and Kelley agreed to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $11,000, plus interest, against each of them, respectively, for their conduct in connection with the fraudulent scheme.","The Securities & Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against John A. Paulsen, a former managing director and fixed income research analyst at a registered broker-dealer, for aiding and abetting a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, from early 2014 until February 2016, Navnoor S. Kang was the Fund's Director of Fixed Income, with investment responsibility for approximately $50 billion of the Fund's assets. According to the SEC's complaint, Kang used his position at the Fund to solicit and receive improper entertainment from Paulsen and Deborah D. Kelley, a registered representative at the broker-dealer. In exchange, Kang directed millions of dollars in state business to the broker-dealer, generating sizable commissions.  The SEC alleges that Paulsen and Kelley planned a ski trip for the purpose of entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. The complaint alleges that Kang told Paulsen and Kelley that the Fund had very strict rules that prohibited him from accepting anything from Paulsen. Yet, according to the complaint, Paulsen and Kelley spent thousands of dollars entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. Paulsen and Kelley then sought reimbursement of those expenses from the broker-dealer, and submited false expense reports which concealed the fact they had entertained Kang on the trip. Later, when the broker-dealer discovered inconsistencies in the expense reports and began an internal investigation, Paulsen and Kelley conspired to lie, and did lie, to the broker-dealer's internal investigators.

Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges Carr and Hanratty with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.

58,"The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court in Los Angeles on July 2, 2018, alleging that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a California-based investment adviser, violated its internal policies and reporting obligations by failing to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on suspicious transactions by independent investment advisers.  According to the SEC's complaint, in 2012 and 2013, the firm terminated its business relationship with 83 independent advisers that it terminated for engaging in activity that Schwabel determined violated the company's internal policy and presented risk to its customers. The complaint alleges that, from as early as 2009, some of the terminated Advisers engaged in transactions that were suspicious under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. In a number of instances, these terminated advisers allegedly misappropriated client funds and continued to execute client trades and collect advisory fees. Schweb terminated these advisers after discovering that they had misused clients' funds, and that the client had not complained about the fees charged to them. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint against the broker-dealer, Schwb terminated those terminated advisors for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1)(A) and Section 10(b)(3)(B) of Securities Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13a. It also alleged that some terminated adviser's accounts had been used by other clients to place trades or solicit client investment fees from other investors. As a result of these violations of this and other securities law provisions, it has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoins the brokerage firm from violating these provisions and orders, as well as to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, interest and injunctive relief.","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a registered broker-dealer, agreed to settle charges that it failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on the suspicious transactions of independent investment advisers that it terminated from using Schwab to custody their client accounts.  To help detect potential violations of the securities laws, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to report suspicious transactions that occur through their firms. The SEC's complaint alleges that in 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated 83 independent investment advisers for engaging in activity that Schwab determined violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers. The complaint further alleges that at least 47 of the terminated advisers engaged in transactions through Schwab that it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect were suspicious and required the filing of a SAR. Schwab failed to file SARs on the suspicious transactions of 37 of these terminated advisers. Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had engaged in a range of suspicious transactions not involving the outright misappropriation or misuse of client funds, including: (1) transactions involving possible undisclosed self-dealing or conflicts of interest; (2) charging client accounts excessive advisory fees; (3) potentially fraudulent transactions in client accounts; (4) posing as a client to effect or confirms transactions in the client account; and (5) executing client trades and/or collecting advisory fees without being properly registered as an adviser. Moreover, Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had misused client funds but the client had not complained.  The SEC's complaint charges Schwab with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder.

59,"On June 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former Equifax employee with insider trading after learning that the company had suffered a massive data breach.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, a software product development manager with responsibility for developing an online user interface into which consumers could input personal information to determine whether they had been impacted by a major cybersecurity breach that occurred on September 8, 2017. According to the SEC, in an effort to prevent future breaches of the U.S. and Canadian securities laws, he traded on the basis of material nonpublic information entrusted to him by his employer, which he later learned was the victim of a large data security breach and had a short deadline because the client intended to go live on Sept. 6, with the help of its payment processors. The breach impacted at least 100 million consumers in the United States and Canada, including 143 million in Canada. In the course of his work, Bonsson sold all of Equica's put options for total net proceeds of more than $75,000, and agreed to pay prejudgment interest thereon. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other court proceeding, however, it has agreed that Boninthu will be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to disgorge ill-gotten gains resulting from his trading. Bontha has also agreed not to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he violated the duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Equiti. He also consented to a temporary restraining order that bars him from future violations of these provisions and orders him to return to his former employer and pay a civil penalty of $5,500.","This past week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former Equifax manager with insider trading in advance of the company’s September 2017 announcement of a massive data breach that exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of approximately 148 million U.S. customers. This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach. In March, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.  According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach. The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options. Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.  Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company’s insider trading policy.  In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.  To settle the SEC’s civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least the fourth quarter of 2012 through the first half of 2013, three executives and one of their companies' directors allegedly entered into a side agreement with a Chinese telecommunications distributor that allowed them to obtain revised purchase orders from their own end users without admitting or denying the sales terms reflected therein. The SEC alleges that the two executives, who were not authorized to disclose the side agreements, then secretly signed quarterly management representation letters to Axesianstels' auditor informing them that they would have no obligation to make payments on the purported sales unless the customer agreed to certain terms in return for the purchase order. In other instances, they allegedly signed accounting statements to conceal the fact that these sales were false and misleading. Finally, in a separate SEC complaint filed in federal court in the Southern District of California, Gray and Sabin consented to a settlement that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 21(d)(3)(A) and 27(c) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the SEC's complaint, Axesstel, Inc., Chief Financial Officer Patrick J. Gray, and former Chief Executive Officer Harold Clark Hickock III, aided and abetted by Director of Contract Fulfillment and Sales Operations Steven R. Sabin, inflated the company's revenues by prematurely recognizing revenue on sales and by improperly recognizing revenue despite entering into undisclosed side agreements that relieved customers of payment obligations. Additionally according to the complaint, the Defendants inflated unit prices of products to hit revenue targets with the agreement that Axesstel would subsequently repay the inflated amounts to the customer as marketing development fees. The SEC alleges that Axesstel's revenue was overstated by 66% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 38% in the first quarter of 2013.

According to the SEC, Gordon, who was not registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission, used his position as the co-owner, Chief Executive Officer, or control person of the Company and solicited investors from multiple states to sell oil and gas projects in West Texas. In reality, none of these offerings provided investors with any real value for their money. Instead, they relied on the advice and success rate of its geologists and geological consultants to determine the potential oil reserves and potential return on investments on those investments. The complaint also alleges Gordon violated Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other SEC court proceeding, Defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2.66 million and civil penalties of up to $1,727,100. Both defendants are also barred from serving as officers or directors of any company or entity that solicits investors for the purpose of raising funds from the public or seeking to purchase securities in connection with these projects, including, without limitation, offering securities to investors who had no prior experience investing in oil or gas development projects and who did not have the financial resources to make the investment decisions that led to their purchase of securities. Additionally, defendants consented to certain conditions of their entry into the settlement, which is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for Texas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.","On June 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Dallas-based oil-and-gas company and its chief executive officer in connection with a series of allegedly fraudulent unregistered oil-and-gas securities offerings that raised millions of dollars from investors.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Jefferey Gordon and Texas Coastal Energy Company, LLC (TCEC) cold-called investors across the country, soliciting their interest in financing the drilling and completion of oil-and-gas prospects in Kansas and Texas in exchange for a share of future oil-and-gas production revenue. According to the complaint, Gordon and TCEC used a combination of false and misleading offering materials and sales pitches to deceive investors. Among other things, Gordon and TCEC lied to investors about TCEC's experience and track record, the advice and success rate of its geologists, the potential reserves on its prospects, the potential return on investments therein, and the manner in which TCEC would use investor funds. Ultimately, Gordon and TCEC raised more than $8 million from at least 80 investor victims. While investors lost almost every dollar invested, TCEC and Gordon misappropriated over $2.6 million of investor funds for their own use.  The SEC's office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert describing 10 red flags that an unregistered offering may be a scam, many of which were present here.  The SEC's complaint charges TCEC and Gordon with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Bordian, an accountant and personal assistant for InterOil Corporation's board of directors, traded on material nonpublic information about the pending acquisition by Oil Search Limited (""Oil Search""), a Papua New Guinea based oil company, to make illicit profits of more than $220,500. The SEC alleges that in violation of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In breach of his duty of trust and confidence to a member of Interoil's Board of Directors and to his company's directors and officers, Bordians sold his information on the confidential acquisition terms and other confidential information, including that the proposed purchase price was at a significant premium over the recent closing market price.

Bordian received e-mail messages indicating that the company was entering into a merger agreement in which its stock would be acquired at a significant premium. The complaint alleges that, shortly before the merger announcement, Bordian purchased out-of-the-money InterOil call options with near-term expiration dates, which meant that Bordian stood to profit only if InterOil's stock price rose significantly shortly after he acquired the options. As alleged in the complaint, following the merger announcement, InterOil's stock price increased over 37% percent, and Bordian sold the InterOil options contracts, making illicit profits of $220,500.

68,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Brent Borland with defrauding at least 44 investors by selling promissory notes to fund his family's lavish lifestyle.  According to the SEC's complaint, in 2014 and June of 2017, the two entities that he controlled, which he allegedly used to raise money from investors in Belize, used investor funds to pay for their lifestyle, including: (a) mortgage payments, (b) tuition payments for the Borlands' children at anelite privateschool, and (c) paying off Alana's credit card debt. (d) The SEC alleges that in the course of the fraudulent scheme, both parties lied to investors about the amount of money they would be able to use to finance the construction and development of an international airport. The complaint also alleges, without admitting or denying the allegations, that the majority of investors' money was actually used for personal expenses, such as paying for a family beach club membership and a private jet. In addition, according to court documents obtained by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, Borl and his wife, Alanna, allegedly misappropriated more than $5.98 million of investor money and used the stolen principal to repay their debts. Accordingly, after the fraud was discovered in March of this year, a forensic accountant at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Authority (SEC) located in New York City and conducted an analysis that determined that over a half-million investors were likely to benefit from the sale of high-end, luxury automobiles and other real estate investments. Without disclosing the alleged fraud in advance of its public disclosure, however, it was not immediately clear whether the investors had any legitimate claim to those funds or if they had legitimate claims to them. As alleged in a complaint filed in federal court in Brooklyn, NY, on April 16, 2018, Judge James R. Donnelly granted a temporary restraining order halting the sales and the issuance of securities in violation of Section 17(a)(1)(A) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 10(b)(2)(B)(3)(C) of Securities Act of 1933, Section 20(c)(4)(a), or Rule 17a-1(e) in connection with the securities fraud.","On May 16, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Brent Borland and two of his companies with misappropriating close to $6 million in investor funds intended to finance an international airport in Belize.

Borland marketed and sold the notes through two companies, Borland Capital Group LLC, which purports to be active in ""alternative investment,"" and Belize Infrastructure Fund I, LLC, which purports to be in the business of construction finance.  The complaint alleges that Borland used millions of dollars of investor funds for personal expenses and unrelated business expenses, including mortgage and property tax payments on his family's Florida mansion, multiple luxury automobiles, private school tuition for his children, $36,000 for his family's beach club membership, and almost $2.7 million to pay off credit cards.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, alleges that in an elaborate scheme to lure investors into believing that his family had exclusive access to Pre-IOP shares, he falsely claimed that the company would be formed by merging with two private companies, KeyPoint Government Solutions and Vencore, Inc.

According to the SEC, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(c) in Section 13(e) therewith, Graceys' false portrayal of wealth and success, his use of publicly available information concerning the merger and his alleged connections to various governments and government co-tractors, was just a form of marketing fraud. The complaint further alleges, however, that as a result of his false representations, many investors began to believe that their money was going to be used for other purposes. For example, one investor alleged that she received over $2 million from a family member, who claimed to own a unique access-to-market position in a company called Perspecta. Another alleged investor, a resident of Loveland, Colorado, learned of this fact through a series of phone calls and emails.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint or providing any other evidence to support their allegations, neither Caldwell nor Smith agreed to be enjoined from the securities laws and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, interest and injunctive relief, as well as a civil penalty of $250,000, which is subject to court approval. The settlement is contingent upon the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Caldwell from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 5(2)(A), and permanently bars him from serving as an officer, director, or officer of any public company in connection with the offering or sale of securities in which he or she was a well-known pastor or a member of an investment advisory firm. He also agreed not to receive any compensation for his conduct. As a result, he and Smith will be barred from acting as officers or directors of public companies and from engaging in transactions, practices and courses of business which operated as fraud or deceit upon one or more clients or prospective clients. They will also be prohibited from participating in any securities offering that is conducted by or in association with a registered broker.","The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged the pastor of one of the largest Protestant churches in the country and a self-described financial planner in a scheme to defraud elderly investors by selling them interests in defunct, pre-Revolutionary Chinese bonds.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, Kirbyjon Caldwell, Senior Pastor at Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, and Gregory Alan Smith, a self-described financial planner who FINRA has barred from the broker-dealer business since 2010, targeted vulnerable and elderly investors with false assurances that the bonds-collectible memorabilia with no meaningful investment value-were worth millions of dollars. Caldwell and Smith raised at least $3.4 million from 29 mostly elderly investors, some of whom liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme. Caldwell and Smith are alleged to have taken approximately $1.8 million of investor funds to pay for personal expenses, including mortgage payments in the case of Caldwell and luxury automobiles in the case of Smith. Offshore individuals received most of the remaining funds.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Caldwell and Smith violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Smith violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Caldwell and Smith, and an officer and director bar against Caldwell.  In a separate complaint the SEC charged attorney Shae Yatta Harper of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting Caldwell's and Smith's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.. Harper agreed to settle the SEC's complaint against her without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.

84,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former investment adviser and life coach with defrauding more than 30 investors by selling unregistered corporate bond notes and offering them fake investment products.  According to the SEC's complaint, DaRayl D. Davis, a resident of Maryland, used his position as an insurance salesman to promote his fraudulent scheme. The complaint alleges that from at least 2003 through the present, Davis recommended and sold securities he described as ""corporate bonds"" and ""guarantee bonds."" The SEC also alleged that Davis used the money he received from the sale of these securities to fund his lavish lifestyle, including lavish vacations, exotic cars, trips to night clubs, and to further his scheme, which he marketed as the Smart Money Millionaire Experience. In addition, the complaint charges Davis with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1) and 206 (2)(2) in the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in court documents filed in federal court in Chicago on December 22, 2017, Judge Richard M. Mascarenhas granted Davis' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $5 million plus prejudgment interest, plus interest and penalties, to be determined by the court upon completion of a two-year, $20,000-plus trial in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and a final judgment that permanently enjoins Davis from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b)(5)(A)(1)(B)(3)(C), and orders him held to account for future violations of those provisions. He is also barred from serving as a director or officer or director of an investment advisory firm.","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a default judgment as to liability has been entered against DaRayl D. Davis, a self-styled ""Financial Coach"" charged in December 2017 with operating an offering and investment advisory fraud.  On December 22, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Davis raised more than $5 million from approximately 30 investors by selling them fictitious financial products described as ""corporate bond notes"" and ""guarantee bonds."" Davis hosted seminars marketed as the ""Smart Money Academy"" and ""The Smart Money Millionaire Experience,"" and used his religious affiliation to gain investors' trust. Investors believed the financial products sold by Davis were legitimate and would preserve and grow their investments. The complaint alleges that the investments were not legitimate and that Davis fabricated documents and made false statements concerning the fictitious financial products. Davis did not invest the money he raised from his clients, but instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, repay prior investors, and further his fraudulent scheme.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Davis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from Davis, as well as disgorgement from relief defendant Affluent Advisory Group, LLC, against which default judgment as to liability also was entered.  At the time it filed its complaint, the SEC requested a temporary restraining order and an order temporarily freezing Davis's assets, both of which were granted the same day. On January 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy J. St. Eve granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, extended the asset freeze pending final judgment in the case, and entered default against Davis. At a hearing on March 26, 2018, Judge St. Eve entered default judgment against Davis as to liability, as well as against relief defendant AAG. Judge St. Eve also held Davis in contempt for violating the asset freeze and scheduled a hearing for May 10, 2018 to determine how to proceed with the remedies phase of the case.

85,"On February 26, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, alleging that Akorn, Inc. and its CFO Timothy Dick violated the company's internal control over financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls violations.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from 2013 to 2014, when the Hi-Tech acquisition and alliances formed between several large wholesalers and certain retail customers in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, it did not have sufficient controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in determination of significant estimates and accounting transactions. The complaint further alleges, in a parallel action, that Dick and Hebeda misappropriated approximately $2.9 million of revenue for a portion of a transaction with one of its wholesaler customers despite having supervisory responsibilities for all of the transactions, including those related to gross-to-net revenue adjustments and inventory reserves. In addition, according to the complaint, after the acquisition was announced in July 2014 and was subject to significant price increases and to a series of accounting adjustments that were not properly accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and were used to determine the value of certain assets. According to The Commission, this was the first time that a company had disclosed material weaknesses in its internal controls for calculating revenue and expenses for its retail and wholesale customers. As a result of these weaknesses and other material limitations, there have been numerous other violations, such as the unauthorized accounting of unreported revenue deductions and the use of non-recurring expenses in connection with the purchase and sale of high-end consumer products, as well as accounting accounting and revenue recognition errors. Additionally, some of this material weakness was discovered in Akorns' financial statements for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2014 through September 30 of 2014. These errors were identified by the SEC as being consistent with its policies and practices, which required it to properly recognize revenue, expenses and liabilities for each of those transactions and agreed to detailed support from the Audit Committee. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Dick has consented to be barred from serving as an officer or director of an SEC-certified company and has agreed not to participate in any future SEC litigation or to pay a penalty.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Akorn, Inc., a Lake Forest, Illinois pharmaceutical company, its former CFO, Timothy Dick, and its former Controller, David Hebeda, based on financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls violations by Akorn (specifically violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder). Akorn, Dick and Hebeda agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.  According to the Commission's complaint, in May 2016, Akorn restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2014 acknowledging material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related, in relevant part, to controls surrounding the company's gross-to-net reserve accounts and estimates. In its restatement, the company also disclosed that it overstated net revenue for 2014 by approximately 7 percent and income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2014 by approximately 136 percent. Akorn's material weaknesses persisted over multiple reporting periods and contributed to Akorn's materially inaccurate 2014 financial statements.  The complaint also alleges that in 2014, Dick, as CFO, and Hebeda, as Controller, had supervisory responsibilities for Akorn's internal accounting controls, gross-to-net revenue accounting and revenue recognition, and exercised control over these company functions. The Commission's complaint charges Dick and Hebeda with control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for Akorn's violations.  Akorn consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Dick and Hebeda consented to the entry of orders: (a) permanently enjoining each of them from controlling any person liable for violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Exchange Act; and (b) imposing a $20,000 civil penalty against each of them.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Lacroix, who is also a recidivist, misappropriated investor funds and engaged in other deceptive acts, including by promising investors returns of 1.354% in under 29 days.  According to the complaint, in an effort to skirt registration requirements of the federal securities laws and avoid liability for violations of Section 17(a)(1)(A) and Section 10(b)(5)(C) thereunder and Sections 5(c), 20(d), and 22(A)(3) in connection with the offering of securities. The complaint further alleges, without admitting or denying the allegations, that the funds were illegally raised through the fraudulent offering and by trading in unregistered securities that were not intended for business development but instead were intended to fund the company's expenses including home decor projects. In other words, investors could expect ""enormous"" and ""real"" returns on investments made in these securities, despite having signed an undertaking that they would not conduct any additional securities transactions in violation of those provisions. Finally, defendants agreed to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties, as well as a civil penalty of $250,000, which will be determined by a court order enjoining them from future violations and from violating the securities registration and registration provisions of these federal laws. Additionally, they will also be barred from serving as officers or directors of any securities companies or entities under their control from participating in any future offering or solicitation of funds, either directly or indirectly, by virtue of having consented to or having agreed not to participate in such an offering.","On December 1, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his company, PlexCorps, in an emergency action to halt an alleged Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud that raised up to $15 million from thousands of investors.

The SEC alleges that, in an effort to prevent future breaches, Ying exercised all of his vested security options and sold the remaining shares in the same company. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia issued a subpoena seeking information on the identity and security of approximately 143 million customers, including those affected by the September 2015 breach, and ordered Ying to pay a civil penalty of $117,000, plus prejudgment interest, as well as a court order prohibiting Ying from working on projects related to this breach until after the public announcement of it.

The complaint also alleged that the defendants used lead lists to solicit investors to call a nd emailing list of potential investors, which were then used by the company to inform investors that they would pay a sales commission of 33.5% to each of its registered brokers and to retain only licensed broker dealers. In addition, in violation of Section 17(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, both of these defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(1), 20(2), and 5(c) of The Securities Act of 1933, as well as Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 31, respectively. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other court proceeding, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of those provisions and orders.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Dedicated Sound and Audio, Inc. (""DSA""), located in Lake Forest, California, and Steven Ventre, its founder, president, and CEO, retained the services of Choice Equity, a telemarketer controlled by recidivist Eric Lovy (formerly known as Eric Beltran), to solicit investors on DSA's behalf. The SEC alleges that investors in the unregistered offering were falsely told in a private placement memorandum drafted by Ventre and Lovy that DSA would pay no more than 15% of the amount raised in sales commissions to registered broker-dealers. In reality, over a 20-month span, DSA paid more than 33% ($1.56 million of $4.6 million) of the amount raised to Choice Equity and Lovy, neither of whom is registered with the SEC. More than half of the commissions went directly to Lovy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges DSA and Ventre with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, charges Ventre with liability as a control person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for DSA's liability under Section 10(b). The complaint further charges Lovy with aiding and abetting DSA's and Ventre's violations of these antifraud provisions. In addition, the SEC charges all of the defendants with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and both Lovy and Choice Equity with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws; imposing civil penalties against each of them; and ordering Lovy and Choice Equity to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of the collective $1.56 million in commissions that they received from DSA, and civil penalties of $160,000 and $870,850, respectively.

For example, Batchelor allegedly used nearly a quarter-million dollars in investor funds to purchase new vehicles and approximately $225,000 to pay student loans. Batchelor also allegedly transferred thousands of dollars in investor funds to other family members.

LaVelle of Marietta, Georgia, with insider trading in the securities of Emeritus Corporation (""Emeritus""), a medical products distributor.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jacksonville, Florida, alleges that beginning in September 2013, a senior officer of In Home Medical Solutions, LLC's COO, who was aware of the merger negotiations, provided confidential information to a company's chief executive officer and a board member about the potential merger. The information, which was not publicly disclosed, was then used to conduct highly confidential and nonpublic negotiations with Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (""Brookdale""), which obtained over thirty percent of its revenue from sales to the subsidiary. In the course of these confidential discussions, in or before the February 20, 2014 merger announcement, InHome Medical's stock price increased by approximately thirty-six percent, and La Velle sold his securities on the day after the announcement. After learning of this merger's potential business implications, he continued to engage in trading, realizing a profit of approximately $25,342. On February 21, 2015, La Veile sold all of his shares in Inhome Medical after learning that it was about to merge with another medical product distribution company. As alleged by the SEC, this was the first time that a former CEO of a public company had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The merger potentially had significant business implications for IHMS because a subsidiary of Emeritus was IHMS' largest customer. Before the merger was publicly announced, LaVelle and Chackerian bought Emeritus securities and each sold them for illegal profits of over $25,000 and $157,000, respectively, the day after the merger announcement.  The SEC's complaint against LaVelle, filed on February 8, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Polese and Cornelius Peterson defrauded two clients through fraudulently using client funds to secure loans from a client without disclosing their conflict of interest. According to the complaint, in early May 2016, the two men allegedly stole approximately $93,000 from one of the clients, a retired paralegal, by falsely representing that the loan payment was intended to cover both of their personal expenses. In reality, it was a loan that was not authorized by the Financial Institution and was used to pay for their children's college tuition. As alleged in the SEC complaint in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 31, 2018, Peterson, who was also employed as an investment adviser representative, engaged in various schemes to defray his client's expenses, including: (1) investing client money into a private investment in which defendants held a financial interest; (2) secretly using clients' accounts and bank routing numbers on the pa yment pages of payees' websites; and (3) charging the client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate quoted by a broker. The complaint further alleged that Peterson violated his fiduciary duty to his clients by making false statements to clients about the amount of money he received from clients in return for his advice, without admitting or denying the allegations in his complaint. Additionally, he allegedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibits the commission from charging clients with securities fraud, and Section 206(2), which bars the Commission from investigating the financial institution's violations of its policies or controls relating to such loans.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced criminal charges against Polese and Peterson.  According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in 2014, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson, while employed as investment advisers at a large financial institution, engaged in various schemes to defraud their clients, including stealing nearly $450,000 from one elderly client. In March 2016, Polese and Peterson fraudulently misappropriated $350,000 of their client's money, using $100,000 of those funds to make investments in their own names, and directing the remaining $250,000 to Polese's personal bank account. Then, from March through May of 2017, Polese made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the same client's account totaling approximately $93,000 to pay Polese's credit card and college tuition expenses for Polese's children.  In addition to stealing client funds, the complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson breached their fiduciary duty to their clients when they (1) secretly put client funds at risk by using a client's assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a private entity in which Polese and Peterson were investors, and (2) invested client funds into an investment in which defendants held a financial interest, without informing the client or disclosing their conflict of interest. Additionally, Polese defrauded two clients through violations of his fiduciary duties to those clients including (1) obtaining a loan from a client on unfavorable terms to the client; and (2) charging a client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate he repeatedly promised to charge her.

95,"On January 22, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York-based broker-dealer with insider trading in call options ahead of Sanofi's announcement that it was acquiring Bioverativ, Inc. The SEC's complaint alleges that one or more unknown traders purchased approximately 1,610 out-of-the-money calls from a Swiss brokerage firm just prior to the announcement of the acquisition. According to SEC filings, at least some of these purchases occurred in connection with a pre-announcement offering of $105 per share of common stock that was due to close on February 16. As alleged in the complaint, these traders were not registered with the SEC and had no prior history of trading on the NASDAQ or the securities exchange. Rather, they purchased the options after the company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the stock of a global pharmaceutical company.  The complaint further alleges the traders' purchases were highly suspicious, timely, and lucrative, as well as the fact that they were in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the impending acquisition of BioVERatIV from the main office of Credit Suisse Securities (USA), Ltd. (""CS Ltd."") in Zurich, Switzerland, which is affiliated with CS Ltd., and which facilitated the purchase and sale of such options, made significant profits on their purchases, including $207,825, based on a 61.9% increase over its January 19 closing price.

The traders, who are currently unknown, allegedly used foreign brokerage accounts in Switzerland to purchase out-of-the-money call options through a U.S.-based brokerage firm and on U.S.-based exchanges in the days leading up to the public announcement of the acquisition.  The court's order freezes the proceeds related to the foreign accounts' trading.  According to the SEC's complaint, some of the options positions taken in these accounts prior to the announcement represented almost 100 percent of the market for those particular out-of-the-money options.

The SEC's complaint alleges that between 1997 and 2016, Ash Narayan and RGT Capital Management, Ltd., a Chicago-based investment advisory firm, directed hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds into high-risk investments in TTR. According to the complaint, the defendants told investors that their investments would be used to build a company that could survive from month to month without paying a fee. They also told their former clients that they would receive a substantial portion of their funds diverted to their own accounts. The complaint charges that, in exchange, Narayan and Harmon misappropriated nearly $2 million in investor money. In return, they received almost $1.5 million from the investors, who were then directed to make Ponzi-like payments in order to keep the scheme from collapsing. As alleged by the SEC, this money was used for personal purposes, including to pay for a residence at the Four Seasons Residences in Austin, Texas, and to support a family of four. Additionally, these funds were used as a basis for making payments to Harmon's company, Forward Market Media, Inc., which was then in receivership and was operating out of Dallas, TX. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC filing, Harmon has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company and from participating in any future SEC-registered investment advisories.

Harmon misappropriated more than $500,000 from individual investors for his own benefit, including for lease payments on a vacation home and his personal residence. The SEC further alleged that Ash Narayan, who previously settled the SEC's charges, misappropriated more than $2 million from individual investors. The defendants also made material misrepresentations to investors regarding the financial health of TTR and prolonged their fraudulent scheme by backdating documents and making Ponzi-like payments to keep the scheme from collapsing.

99,"On January 11, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged David S. Haddad of Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, a Connecticut-based reinsurance company, with violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, from April 2012 until August 2016, HADDAD and his related companies raised more than $1 million from at least 29 investors by offering and selling non-existent stop-loss insurance products to self-insured companies. The SEC alleges that, in addition to misstatements and omissions in the prospectus and in other documents provided to investors in connection with the scheme, they also misrepresented that their funds would be used to build and grow the company. In fact, many of the investors raised money through the offer and sale of securities, including Trafalgar, which used the funds to make payments to other investors, and to support a dog rescue charity. Additionally, some investors received payments for their own personal expenses, such as vacations, art and antiques, entertainment, rent-to-own arrangements, purchases of multiple homes, artwork, dining out at various restaurants, entertaining at his properties, buying dog toys and making Ponzi-like payments in return for the money they raised. Without admitting or denying the allegations in court documents obtained by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Connecticut and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Connecticut Division of Criminal Investigation, there have been no criminal charges filed against the defendants. These charges are subject to court approval and a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and Section 10(b)(5 thereunder), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2.5 million, as well as civil penalties of up to $250,000, against each of them.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut resident David S. Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors. Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC. Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012. He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds. According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad. Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors. The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of these laws. Haddad and Trafalgar also have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $619,382.43 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,131.83. Haddad and New England Re have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $269,080 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest $2,592.66. In addition, Haddad has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $181,071 and has consented to the imposition of a permanent bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company. Haddad further has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from providing information to, soliciting, or accepting investments or funds from any investor or potential investors regarding the offer or sale of any securities issued by any entity that he directly or indirectly owns, controls, consults for, or is employed by, unless he first provides such person with a written disclosure regarding his prior regulatory history and maintains written records of such disclosures.

100,"On January 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charging a former municipal advisor and his former principal with defrauding Rolling Fork Municipal Advisors, Inc. (MALACHI), a Georgia-based municipal advisory firm, and its former president, Porter B. Bingham, of Roswell, Georgia, with violations of Section 15B(a)(5) and Municipal Securitization Rule G-17 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingingham violated the securities registration provisions of the Municipal Securities Regulatory Act of 1934 (""MA Agreement"") and violated their fiduciary duty to the city. The complaint also alleges the defendants aided and abetted the violations by using shell companies and registered representatives to underwrite the municipal bond offering. In fact, according to this complaint, neither the City nor the bond trustee disclosed the alleged violations until after the offering closed in October 2015. According to these SEC filings, in late May 2015, a registered representative with several different broker-dealers recommended that the New York City hire Stovall and Bonwick as municipal advisors. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or providing any other evidence, Malachi agreed to pay a total of $33,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil money penalties, as well as a civil penalty of up to $1,500, which will be determined by the court upon final approval of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the companies from violating the MSA Agreement and prohibits them from engaging in any further violations or violations in connection with municipal advisement services, such as underwriting municipal debt and capital plans, or making a presentation at a municipal audit report in a time-lapsed manner to determine the proper net capital amount for the issuant of municipal securities. As a result of these violations, The City of New Orleans and the Mississippi Department of Finance have jointly charged the two defendants with violating these antifraud provisions and are seeking permanent injunctions, civil penalties and a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from future violations.","The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action on January 2, 2018, alleging that an Atlanta, Georgia-based municipal advisor and its principal defrauded the City of Rolling Fork, Mississippi and failed to disclose certain related-party payments in connection with a municipal bond offering.  In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, the SEC alleges that Malachi Financial Products, Inc. (""Malachi""), a Georgia corporation, and its principal, Porter B. Bingham of Roswell, Georgia, fraudulently overcharged Rolling Fork for municipal advisory services related to an October 2015 municipal bond offering. Malachi is registered as a municipal advisor with both the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (""MSRB""). According to the complaint, after the offering closed, Malachi and Bingham submitted two invoices to the bond trustee for payment. The SEC alleges that one of those invoices was fraudulent, because it was for services that Malachi and Bingham did not perform and the city did not authorize. The complaint also alleges that Bingham failed to disclose to the city that he had accepted payments totaling $2,500 from Anthony Stovall, an employee of a municipal underwriter, shortly before he and Malachi recommended that the city hire Stovall's firm to underwrite the bond offering. The complaint alleges that the city ultimately hired that underwriting firm based on Bingham and Malachi's recommendation. Finally, the complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingham violated their fiduciary duty to the city.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Malachi and Bingham violated Sections 15B(a)(5) and 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint further alleges that both defendants violated MSRB Rule G-17, which requires municipal advisors to deal fairly with their clients. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and other relief against both defendants.  In separate administrative proceedings, the Commission entered a settled Administrative Order against Stovall.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Justin Delfino and supervised by Peter J. Diskin, both of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Edward Sullivan and Mr. Delfino and supervised by M. Graham Loomis of the Atlanta Regional Office. An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Nadine Sophia Evans of the National Exam Program and Kee Han of the Atlanta Regional Office.",0.5836,0.5393
101,"On December 26, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New Jersey-based corporate and securities attorney with violating the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (""Global Digital""), a microcap company, engaged in the unregistered sale of non-exempt securities in 2013. The SEC alleges that in violation of Section 5(a) and 5.5(c) of The Securities Act of 1933, Naccarato, his company and its former CFO instructed the transfer agent to remove the restrictive legends from the stock certificates of certain shareholders, thus allowing the shares to become free trading and subsequently sold. Without admitting or denying the allegations, GDA declined to comment on the Commission's allegations and the settlement is subject to court approval. In a parallel action filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, on December 25, 2016, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered an order permanently enjoining the company from violating Sections 5a, 5 (c), and 7(e)(1) in connection with the offer or sale or distribution of securities pursuant to, or claiming, an exemption under Section 4(b) predicated on Securities act Rule 144, and that these shareholders' proposed sales of shares were not affiliates of Global digital. Gda. Michael G. Koonin, Senior Trial Counsel, for GIDA, filed an enforcement action on January 2, 2018, seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a civil penalty against Gada. He also seeks a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of these provisions, including, without limitation, participating in any opinion letter related to such offering or Sale.","The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered Final Judgment in a Securities and Exchange Commission case against California-based attorney Owen H. Naccarato for violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that in September 2013, Naccarato issued two opinion letters pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") improperly concluding that Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (""Global Digital""), a Florida-based microcap company, was not a shell company and that certain shareholders were not affiliates of Global Digital. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Naccarato improperly instructed Global Digital's transfer agent to remove the restrictive legends from these shareholder certificates. Many of the shares were then sold in unregistered public distributions.  Naccarato consented to the entry of the Final Judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commission's complaint. The Final Judgment permanently enjoins Naccarato from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and orders him to pay $1,000 in disgorgement, $127.77 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  The Final Judgment also prohibits Naccarato, for a period of five years, from directly or indirectly providing, or receiving compensation from the provision of, professional legal services to any person or entity in connection with the offer or sale of securities pursuant to, or claiming, an exemption under Section 4(a)(1) predicated on Securities Act Rule 144, or any other exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, including, without limitation, participating in the preparation or issuance of any opinion letter related to such offering or sale.
