The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of California, alleges that from January 2013 through January 2017, Leroy Lee Young and YCM Young raised at least $362,000 from 32 investors through false claims that he would use their money to fund a bond or hedge fund offering and that they would receive a ten times return on their investment. Young allegedly told investors that his money would be held in escrow and be returned to him if the bond offering did not occur. According to the SEC, in violation of Section 5(a) of the federal securities laws and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 10(b)(5)(b)-5(c), Young's statements were false and misleading. In addition, he falsely told potential investors about his relevant experience and industry access and the safety of his investment, and how he could generate returns of 10 times their initial investment in sixty days. Without admitting or denying the allegations of these false statements or making any representations to investors in any given way, YYCM and Young continued to solicit investors' money from the investors, including those who invested personally. The complaint further alleged that Young misled investors into believing that their principal would return to them when the bonds offering was complete. To date, neither Young nor Young has paid their investors the promised returns nor returned any of their invested money, despite having promised them that the offering would occur in less than a month. Instead, they invested their remaining money in bonds and, alternately, for fees associated with launching a fund that never occurred. As a result of violating Section 17(e) and 5.5 of those provisions, there has been no registration statement issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District.","On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy ""Lee"" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that George L. Taylor and his company, Temenos Advisory, Inc. (Temenos) and its principal, George Taylor, defrauded clients of the private placement companies they controlled by Taylor. According to the complaint filed today, from 2014 through 2017, Taylor allegedly steered clients into unprofitable private placements by promising them high returns on investments in companies that he controlled. In addition, he allegedly encouraged his clients to make risky investments by telling them that the investments would be ""a bunch of crap"" and that they would ""sell every unitthey make and be a dominant player in the industry."" The complaint also alleged that Taylor failed to disclose to clients that certain of these investments were not suitable for their clients, and instead encouraged them to invest in other companies, such as a fiber optic distribution company or a high-tech company. Without admitting or denying the allegations, however, Defendants allegedly violated the fiduciary duty that every investment adviser has to perform due diligence before recommending an investment in a company to its clients. As a result of their conduct, they have agreed to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $250,000 plus prejudgment interest, as well as to pay a civil penalty of up to $1,200.

Taylor steered advisory clients and other investors, including senior citizens and individuals approaching retirement, into four risky, illiquid private offerings. While Temenos and Taylor charged advisory fees for unbiased financial advice, they allegedly concealed from their clients the high commissions they were pocketing from these risky and unsuitable investment recommendations, including cash and ownership stakes in the private companies they recommended, and fraudulently misled clients about the risks and prospects of the investments. The SEC also alleges that Temenos and Taylor grossly overbilled some of their advisory clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Connecticut, charges Temenos and Taylor with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

According to the SEC, in a parallel action filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Nevada and the District of Nevada in connection with the alleged violations of antifraud provisions of Section 17A(d)(1) and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and that it aided and abetted the violations by failing to file an independent accountant's report and to make payments to certain of its issuers. In addition, it failed to report to DTCC the amount of money it diverted for its own benefit, including $1.6 million to First 100, which was to be disbursed to other investors. The complaint also alleges, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint against Shindle, that he violated Section 10(b)(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17Ad-12 and 17AD-13 therein and in violation of Sections 17(c) (1), (2), and (3)(A) in order to prevent the transfer of funds and securities for certain issuances from being misused, or to pay penalties of up to $20,500 per month, payable to a single person, for a total of $2,078,814.97.

The SEC alleged that, in August 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1.45 million for the benefit of China Energy Corporation.

The complaint alleges that Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of this money for his and Quicksilver's own use and benefit, including $500,000 to make a four-day loan to a Nevada real estate company.  According to the complaint, the borrower failed to repay the principal or interest as planned. Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman did not timely forward China Energy's funds to DTCC, despite repeated requests. Quicksilver and Shinderman also made a series of misrepresentations in response China Energy's and DTCC's requests for the funds.  Quicksilver ultimately paid DTCC approximately six weeks later, after recovering the loan principal from the real estate company. The complaint also alleges that Quicksilver untimely filed an independent accountant's report with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 31, 2013.

The complaint alleges that, from at least January 1, 2017, Gaylen Dean Rust of Salt Lake City, Utah began soliciting investors to trade in silver bullion from Brink's Global Services USA. He then began selling the silver in his own safekeeping, and then sold it on the open market. In total, he raised approximately $85.7 million from approximately 300 investors across the country, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors who had purchased silver from him. According to the SEC, since the beginning of 2018, the amount of silver he sold on his behalf has increased by more than 20 percent from the year before.

Rust claimed that his silver trading program results in average annual returns of 20% to 25%, with some years experiencing significantly higher returns. Rust also told investors that his silver trading program has almost no risk.
