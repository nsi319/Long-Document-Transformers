U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21053 / May 21, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Pawel P. Dynkowski, Matthew W. Brown, Jacob Canceli, Gerard J. D&#8217;Amaro, Joseph Mangiapane Jr., Nathan M. Michaud, Marc J. Riviello and Adam S. Rosengard, Civil Action No. 09-361 (D. Del.) (May 20, 2009)  SEC Charges Eight Participants in Penny Stock Manipulation Ring  The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Pawel P. Dynkowski, Matthew W. Brown, Jacob Canceli, Gerard J. D&#8217;Amaro, Joseph Mangiapane Jr., Nathan M. Michaud, Marc J. Riviello and Adam S. Rosengard.  The complaint alleges that in 2006 and 2007, Dynkowski, a Polish citizen who resided in the U.S., engaged in market manipulation schemes with at least four separate stocks:  GH3 International, Inc., Asia Global Holdings, Inc., Playstar Corp., and Xtreme Motorsports of California, Inc.  As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski&#8217;s co-defendants each participated in one or more of these schemes, which together generated more than $6.2 million in illicit profits.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that these fraudulent schemes generally followed the same pattern:  Dynkowski and his accomplices agreed to sell large blocks of shares for penny stock companies in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.  The companies put these shares in nominee accounts that Dynkowski and his accomplices controlled.  The defendants pumped the market price of the stocks using wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, often timed to coincide with false or touting press releases by the companies, to give the market the false impression that there was real demand for these stocks.  After artificially inflating the market price of the stocks, Dynkowski and his accomplices then dumped the shares obtained from the issuers and divided the illicit proceeds.           The SEC&#8217;s complaint further alleges that:    The pump-and-dump scheme involving GH3 International, Inc. stock occurred between October and December 2006.  Dynkowski orchestrated this fraud with Matthew W. Brown, who operates a penny stock website called InvestorsHub.com.  Brown introduced Dynkowski to a representative of GH3 and to Jacob Canceli, a penny stock promoter who participated in the scheme.  Brown acted as a liaison between Dynkowski, Canceli and the issuer.  Dynkowski and his associates used wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading, timed to coincide with false, misleading and touting press releases by the company, to inflate the price of GH3 stock.  Canceli provided the accounts from which Dynkowski subsequently sold purportedly unrestricted shares received from the issuer.  The scheme culminated in mid-December 2006, with Dynkowski dumping 312 million shares of GH3 stock for total illicit proceeds of $747,609.&nbsp;  Brown planned the Asia Global pump-and-dump scheme with Joseph Mangiapane Jr. and Marc J. Riviello, who were both registered representatives at a small broker-dealer in California.  Dynkowski and Nathan M. Michaud, who met through InvestorsHub.com, pumped the price of Asia Global stock using wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, coordinated with false, misleading, and touting press releases by the company.  The scheme occurred in three cycles:  August-September 2006, November-December 2006, and January-February 2007.  After manipulating the price of stock, Dynkowski, Brown, Mangiapane and Riviello dumped more than 54 million shares that had been improperly registered on SEC Form S-8 and held in nominee accounts.  The illicit proceeds from this scheme totaled at least $4,050,529.&nbsp;  Dynkowski and Gerard J. D&#8217;Amaro carried out the Playstar pump-and-dump scheme.  The two of them met through InvestorsHub.com.  D&#8217;Amaro acted as the liaison with the issuer as well as the nominee account holder for the purportedly unrestricted shares received from the company.  In this scheme, which occurred during October and November 2006, Dynkowski pumped Playstar&#8217;s stock through wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading.  Dynkowski and D&#8217;Amaro sold 11.5 million shares for total illicit proceeds of $1,180,294.&nbsp;  Dynkowski and an accomplice carried out the Xtreme Motorsports pump-and-dump scheme.  The two of them, who met through InvestorsHub.com, pumped Xtreme Motorsports stock through wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading during January and February 2007.  Dynkowski&#8217;s friend, Adam S. Rosengard, served as the nominee account holder who facilitated the dump of 13 million purportedly unrestricted shares of Xtreme Motorsports stock.  After pumping the stock, Dynkowski sold the shares from Rosengard&#8217;s account generating illicit proceeds of $257,646.     The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that Dynkowski and Brown violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder; that Canceli, D&#8217;Amaro, Mangiapane, and Riviello violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; that Michaud violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; and that Rosengard violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.&nbsp; The complaint seeks against each defendant a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties, and, as to certain defendants, orders barring them from participating in penny stock offerings.    The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Delaware also announced today felony criminal charges against Dynkowski, Brown, Canceli, D&#8217;Amaro, Mangiapane, and Riviello.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Delaware; the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the Internal Revenue Service &#8211; Criminal Investigations; and the Delaware State Police for their assistance in this matter.    The SEC&#8217;s investigation is continuing.   SEC Complaint in this matter  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21053.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 05/21/2009

Dynkowski, et al., United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Civil Action No.: 08-CIV-4928 (RNB)   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Wilmington, Del., charging a ring of serial penny stock manipulators with engaging in fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes with at least four separate stocks: GH3 International, Inc. (GH3), Asia Global Holdings, Ltd. ("Asia Global"), Playstar Corp. (&#8220;Playstar&#8221;), and Xtreme Motorsports of California (âC.M.&nbsp;).  According to the complaint, in 2006 and 2007, the defendants engaged in a series of fraudulent schemes in which they pumped the market price of the stock through wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading to give the false impression that there was real demand for these securities. The complaint alleges that these schemes generally followed the same pattern.  In one scheme, defendants, Matthew W. Brown, Gerard D'Amaro, Joseph Mangiapane and Marc J. Michaud, all registered representatives at a small broker-dealer in California, allegedly agreed to sell large blocks of shares of stock for penny stocks in exchange for a portion of their proceeds. These issuers put these shares in nominee accounts that Dynkies controlled, where they sold the shares to unsuspecting investors, generating illicit proceeds of more than $6.2 million. In the other scheme the SEC alleges, defendant Matthew Brown coordinated the manipulative trades, which were timed to coincide with false, misleading and touting press releases from the issuer to artificially inflate the share price. This scheme culminated in mid-December 2006, with the release of a press release that falsely stated that the company's profits had increased by 300%. The SEC's complaint charges Brown with aiding and abetting the scheme. He is charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the charges, Brown has consented to a permanent injunction against future violations

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20645 / July 15, 2008  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Homeland Safety International, Inc. F/K/A Sniffex, Inc.; Mark B. Lindberg, Petar D. Mihaylov, Yuri Markov, Paul B. Johnson, and Nicholas V. Klausgaard and Ilona V. Klausgaard, Civil Action No. 3:08 CV 11970 (N.D. Tex. July 15, 2008)  Securities and Exchange Commission  v. Mark B. Lindberg, Civil Action No. 08 CV 402 CVE SAJ (N.D. Okla. July 14, 2008)  SEC Files Two Market Manipulation Enforcement Actions With a Common Defendant  Cases Each Include a Settlement with Mark B. Lindberg; Sniffex Case Includes Other Defendants  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed two separate market manipulation enforcement cases: one filed today involving Homeland Safety International, Inc. (originally incorporated as Sniffex, Inc.), a Nevada corporation with a principal place of business in Irving, Texas ("Sniffex"), and the other filed yesterday involving three issuers &#8212; National Storm Management Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Glen Ellyn, Illinois ("NLST"); Deep Rock Oil and Gas, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma ("DPRK"); and Global Beverages Solutions ("GBVS"), a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The companies traded over the counter under the symbols SNFX (now HSFI), NLST, DPRK and GBVS, respectively. Mark B. Lindberg, 40, of Coppell, Texas, was charged in both cases and has settled them without admitting or denying the allegations in the two complaints. In the Sniffex complaint, the Commission also named Sniffex; its President Paul B. Johnson, 60, of Colleyville, Texas; Petar D. Mihaylov, 28, of Pazardjik, Bulgaria; Yuri P. Markov, 50, of Sofia, Bulgaria; Nicholas V. Klausgaard, 22 of Denmark; and Ilona V. Klausgaard, 49, of Denmark as defendants.  Allegations in the Sniffex Complaint  The Commission's complaint filed in the Northern District of Texas alleges that from October 2004 through April 2006, defendants Mihaylov and Markov acquired control of Sniffex &#8212; and carried out a $32 million pump-and-dump fraud scheme in concert with the other defendants. They acquired Sniffex in 2004 as a "shell" company from defendant Lindberg who agreed to provide them 15 million shares of so-called "free-trading" stock. To do this, Lindberg, Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson, Sniffex's President, participated in a sham SEC Rule 504 stock offering that ultimately resulted in scheme participants obtaining virtually all of the company's purportedly free-trading stock.  &nbsp; The complaint further alleges that Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson then engaged in a fraudulent promotional campaign intended to inflate the share price and trading volume in the public market for Sniffex stock. The campaign characterized Sniffex's primary product, a purported hand-held bomb detector invented by Markov, which was also called Sniffex, as a critical breakthrough in the global war against terrorism. At the behest of Mihaylov and Markov, Johnson drafted and issued 33 press releases on Sniffex's behalf. The press releases contained materially false information about tests regarding the product's ability to detect explosives and the company's financial situation. These fraudulent claims were parroted by Mihaylov in a spam-email campaign and in a glossy direct-mail piece.  According to the complaint, as a result of the fraudulent promotional campaign, Sniffex's share price increased from $0.80 to $6.00, giving the bogus company a market capitalization of $474 million at the scheme's peak. The individual defendants profited handsomely by disregarding re-sale restrictions and selling their scheme-derived shares into the artificially inflated market. Lindberg sold approximately 2.071 million shares for a net gain of approximately $315,481; Mihaylov sold approximately 3.73 million shares for approximately $11.3 million; Markov sold approximately 2.8 million shares for approximately $8.6 million; and the Klausgaards sold approximately 3.75 million shares for approximately $12.3 million. Neither the Sniffex press releases nor other public statements made in the scheme disclosed that Markov and Mihaylov controlled Sniffex, that they and the Klausgaards controlled virtually all of the company's public float, and that this group intended to sell, and was selling, millions of secretly owned shares into the market.  The Commission's complaint charges Sniffex, Lindberg, Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson with violations of the securities-registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5, and charges the Klausgaards with violations of the securities-registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The Commission seeks the following relief from Mihaylov, Markov, Johnson, and the Klausgaards: permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, penny-stock bars, and accountings. Lindberg, without admitting or denying any allegations in the complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar.  Allegations in the National Storm, Deep Rock, and Global Beverage Complaint  The Commission's complaint filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma alleges that defendant Lindberg and other members of a Shell Creation Group ("SCG") manipulated at least three penny stocks from 2004 through 2006, including NLST, DPRK, and GBVS. Lindberg and the other members of the SCG, including attorneys, stock promoters, and financiers, worked together to acquire unrestricted shares of the three issuers and to profit by selling these shares into the market while manipulating the price of the stock by means of distributing promotional materials and coordinated trading. The SCG reaped profits in excess of $20 million from the sale of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock, and Lindberg personally reaped over $6.2 million in ill-gotten gains from this illegal conduct.  The complaint alleges that the SCG exploited the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina to manipulate the stock of NLST and DPRK. NLST purported to be a "storm restoration firm specializing in residential home repair from the effects of wind and hail damage." DPRK purported to be "an oil and gas exploration and production company." Lindberg and other members of the SCG assisted these companies reverse merge with SCG controlled shell companies. Throughout the reverse merger process, SCG members obtained control over large quantities of NLST and DPRK stock for its members and/or their nominees, which was issued without restriction based on legal opinion letters predicated on false information. In or about August and September 2005, the SCG began to orchestrate and pay for promotional campaigns, including faxes, spam emails, and glossy promotional pamphlets touting NLST and DPRK, claiming that Hurricane Katrina would result in greater profits and higher share prices for the companies. Some of the promotional materials encouraged readers to purchase the stock and included price targets. None of the NLST or DPRK promotional materials disclosed that the persons who ultimately orchestrated and paid for the promotional campaigns, the SCG, owned or controlled significant positions in the stocks and that they intended to sell stock while encouraging readers to purchase it. Additionally, the emails falsely indicated that NLST and DPRK made filings with the SEC.  The complaint further alleges that in the spring and summer of 2005, the SCG obtained control of a company that had elected business development status under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and had registered its securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The SCG renamed the company GBVS, and used it to acquire a company named Rudy Beverages. The SCG obtained control over large quantities of unrestricted shares of GBVS for its members and/or their nominees. Like NLST and DPRK, the SCG orchestrated and paid for promotional campaigns, including faxes, spam emails, and glossy promotional pamphlets touting GBVS. Some of the promotional materials encouraged readers to purchase the stock and included price targets. None of the GBVS promotional materials disclosed that the persons who ultimately orchestrated and paid for the promotional campaigns, the SCG, owned or controlled significant positions in the stock and that they intended to sell the stock while encouraging readers to purchase it.  According to the complaint, in some instances, accounts controlled by members of the SCG, including Lindberg, bought and sold NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock in an effort to increase the volume in the market and to increase the price shown for the stocks. This trading activity and other trading activities were sometimes coordinated on a daily basis. During the SCG's promotional campaigns for all of the issuers, the price and daily trading volume of the stocks increased significantly. Throughout the promotional campaigns, Lindberg and other members of the SCG engaged in heavy selling of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock for prices far below the value predictions asserted in the promotional materials. The SCG and Lindberg personally profited through their sales of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock into the manipulated market.  The complaint further alleges that the NLST and DPRK shares were sold by members of the SCG, including Lindberg, without being registered with the Commission and without a viable exemption from registration.  The Commission's complaint charges Lindberg with violations of the securities-registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Lindberg, without admitting or denying any allegations in the complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar.  Acknowledgements  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Oklahoma, the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and FINRA.  The Commission's investigations in these matters are ongoing.  The Commission has published guidance for investors concerning investments in microcap stocks.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20702 / September 10, 2006  SEC v. Homeland Safety International, Inc., Mark B. Lindberg, Petar D. Mihaylov, Yuri P. Markov, Paul B Johnson, and Ilona V. Klausgaard, Civil Action No.: 06-CV-1479 (N.D. Texas)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, alleging violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that from October 2004 through April 2006, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent promotional campaign designed to inflate the price and trading volume of Sniffex stock.  According to the complaint:   From May 17, 2005, to give effect to a Rule 504 offering intended to boost the company's stock price, Johnson and two of his companies, Interim Capital Corporation (Interim), a Nevada corporation controlled by the Klausgaards, sold 15 million shares of common stock purportedly to two Nevada residents and three private Nevada companies.&nbsp; The press releases contained false claims that the device could detect explosives, or that Johnson was a mere figurehead who controlled virtually all of that company&rsquo;s public float and that he was the president and CEO of a private company he controlled. In fact, these false statements were fact-checked by two other individuals, who also used nominees to transfer approximately 3.75 million of their shares into the account of another company they controlled, in violation of Section 15(e) (the "Rule 504" offering).  In addition, as a result of this conduct, all defendants are charged with violating the registration provisions and the broker-dealer-registration provisions under Section 17(b)(a)(1). The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, an officer-and-director bar, penny stock bars, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and accountings against each defendant and against all but one of them, a permanent officer and director, permanently enjoining them from future violations and ordering them to pay a total of over $1.1 million to settle the charges. This is the first civil enforcement action arising from the Rule

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No.  19650 / April 11, 2006  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Sonja Anticevic et al., 05 Civ. 6991 (KMW) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC COMPLAINT CHARGES INTERNATIONAL INSIDER TRADING RING INCLUDING PERSONNEL AT MERRILL LYNCH AND GOLDMAN SACHS  On April 11, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission sought leave to file a second amended complaint (&#8220;Complaint&#8221;) in its pending action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging insider trading in advance of the August 3, 2005, announcement (&#8220;Announcement&#8221;) by Reebok International Ltd. (&#8220;Reebok&#8221;) that it had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG (&#8220;Adidas&#8221;).  The Complaint alleges widespread and brazen international schemes of serial insider trading orchestrated by two individuals &#8212; Eugene Plotkin (&#8220;Plotkin&#8221;), a research analyst in the Fixed Income division of Goldman Sachs Group (&#8220;Goldman Sachs&#8221;), and David Pajcin (&#8220;Pajcin&#8221;), a former employee of Goldman Sachs &#8212; that yielded at least $6.7 million of illicit gains.  In one scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin persuaded a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (&#8220;Merrill Lynch&#8221;) to provide tips on upcoming mergers in return for a share of the trading profits.  In another scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals to obtain jobs at a printing plant in Wisconsin, steal advance copies of Business Week magazine and tip Plotkin and Pajcin on the names of companies discussed favorably in the &#8220;Inside Wall Street&#8221; (&#8220;IWS&#8221;) column before the magazine became public.  Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the inside information, initially in an account in Pajcin&#8217;s name and later, in accounts in the names of others in Europe and the United States.  Plotkin and Pajcin also tipped several individuals in the United States and Europe in return for a share of their trading profits.    In total, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in at least 25 stocks within one year based on inside information obtained through these schemes.  The Commission&#8217;s Complaint charges 13 individuals in the United States and Europe for their roles in the schemes.  This Complaint follows two prior complaints filed by the Commission in August 2005, charging insider trading in Reebok securities and successfully freezing over $6 million in trading proceeds.    In its initial filing in this matter, on August 5, 2005, the Commission obtained a court order freezing a securities account in the name of Sonja Anticevic (&#8220;Anticevic&#8221;), a Croatian national and resident.  The Anticevic account engaged in a series of highly profitable trades in &#8220;out of the money&#8221; call options of Reebok just prior to Reebok&#8217;s Announcement.  On August 18, 2005, the Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Anticevic which, among other relief, continues the asset freeze.    On August 18, 2005, the Commission also filed an amended complaint seeking additional emergency relief against eight additional defendants, including residents of the United States, Croatia and Germany, trading through several domestic and off-shore accounts.  As alleged in the amended complaint, the defendants acted in concert or under a common direction in placing the Reebok trades, and collectively netted a profit of over $6 million. Among others, the amended complaint charged Pajcin, who is Anticevic&#8217;s nephew, alleging that Pajcin placed or directed some of the Reebok trades, and tipped other defendants who placed Reebok trades.  Also charged were Henry Siegel, a resident of Pomona, New York; Monika Vujovic, a resident of New York, New York; Elvis Santana, a resident of Brooklyn, New York; Zoran Sormaz, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia; Perica Lopandic, a resident of Reinbek, Germany; Ilija Borac, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia; and Certain Unknown Persons trading in an account at an Austrian broker, Direktanlage.at AG (the &#8220;Direktanlage Traders&#8221;).    Acting on the Commission's request for emergency relief, the Court issued temporary restraining orders which, among other things, froze the proceeds of trading in Reebok securities in the domestic accounts and required the repatriation and freezing of the proceeds in the foreign accounts.  Ultimately, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against all of the defendants, and, as a result, the Commission obtained Court orders freezing over $6 million in illegal profits stemming from insider trading in Reebok securities.    The Commission&#8217;s Complaint, today, alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin explored a variety of audacious insider-trading schemes.  Among others, Plotkin and Pajcin met with a series of individuals employed at various investment banks in an attempt to get them to provide non-public information about deals those banks were handling.  Plotkin and Pajcin also contemplated various schemes involving exotic dancers, including having them garner information from bankers while dancing, and using them to induce investment bankers to provide Plotkin and Pajcin with information.  At least two schemes were consummated:    The Merrill Lynch Scheme  The Complaint alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin infiltrated the investment banking unit of Merrill Lynch, repeatedly learning of mergers and acquisitions transactions before they became public.  In exchange for a share of the illegal profits, Stanislav Shpigelman (&#8220;Shpigelman&#8221;), an analyst at Merrill Lynch, leaked confidential information to defendants Plotkin and Pajcin concerning at least six mergers or acquisitions that Merrill Lynch was working on, prior to the time the deals became public, including deals between (i) The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company and The Gillette Company; (ii) Novartis AG and Eon Labs, Inc.; (iii) Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp.; (iv) Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and LabOne, Inc.; (v) Celgene Corp. and a company considering acquiring Celgene; and (vi) Reebok and Adidas.  Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the insider information and passed the insider information on to individuals in the United States and Europe (&#8220;Traders&#8221;) who traded on it.  Plotkin and Pajcin had an agreement with the Traders, pursuant to which they were to receive a percentage of the illicit profits made by the Traders.  The Merrill Lynch Scheme yielded over $6.4 million in illicit trading profits.    The Business Week Scheme  The Complaint further alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin also infiltrated one of the printing plants utilized by Business Week, repeatedly obtaining advance copies of the market-moving IWS column in Business Week.  Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals &#8212; first, Nickolaus Shuster (&#8220;Shuster&#8221;), and later Juan C. Renteria, Jr. (&#8220;Renteria&#8221;) &#8212; to obtain employment at Quad/Graphics, Inc., one of four printing plants that print Business Week magazine, for the sole purpose of stealing copies of upcoming editions of the magazine, and calling Plotkin or Pajcin to read them key portions of IWS &#8212; a widely-read column in the magazine that generally moves the price of the securities of companies mentioned in it &#8211; prior to the time the column became available to the public.  The Complaint alleges that Shuster and Renteria provided Plotkin or Pajcin with insider information concerning at least twenty companies that were featured in the IWS column.  Plotkin and Pajcin then either traded on the IWS insider information or passed the information to some or all of the Traders, who traded on the insider information.  The Business Week Scheme yielded over $345,000 in illicit trading profits.    The Commission&#8217;s Complaint names 5 new defendants &#8212; Plotkin, Shpigelman, Shuster, Renteria, and Mikhail Plotkin.  To date, the Commission has charged the following persons in this matter:  Orchestrators of Fraud  Eugene Plotkin, age 26, is a resident of New York, New York.  Plotkin has been employed at Goldman Sachs since July 2000, where he is currently an Associate in the Fixed Income Research division.  Plotkin was, along with Pajcin, the architect of the Merrill Lynch and Business Week Schemes.  Plotkin contributed funds to Pajcin&#8217;s trading account, which traded on the basis of insider information obtained from the two schemes in certain of the securities referred to in the Complaint.  Plotkin and Pajcin agreed to split the profits from Pajcin&#8217;s trading, along with all the proceeds they collected from their tippees, evenly between themselves.&nbsp;  David Pajcin, age 29, was, during the Relevant Period, a resident of Clifton, New Jersey.  Pajcin was formerly associated with several broker-dealers, including Goldman Sachs.  Pajcin was, along with Plotkin, the architect of the Merrill Lynch and Business Week Schemes.  Pajcin traded for his own account, on the basis of insider information obtained from the two schemes, in certain securities referred to in the Complaint.  Pajcin also passed the insider information on to other persons in exchange for a share of their illicit profits.  Sources of Insider Information  Stanislav Shpigelman, age 23, is a resident of Brooklyn, New York.  Shpigelman has been employed as a Mergers and Acquisitions Analyst at Merrill Lynch since July 2004.  Shpigelman was the source of the non-public confidential information, and a tipper, in connection with the six mergers and acquisitions deals identified under the Merrill Lynch Scheme.&nbsp;  Nickolaus Shuster, age 24, was, during the relevant period a resident of Newark, New Jersey, Hartford, Wisconsin, and, most recently, Lexington, Tennessee.  Shuster was employed at Quad Graphics from approximately October 11, 2004, to approximately January 6, 2005, when he was terminated.

Renteria, Jr. and Henry Siegel, et al., United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 05 CV 6991 (KMW)  SEC CHARGES TWO FORMER GLOBAL LYNCH EXECUTIVES WITH INSIDER TRADING  On August 2, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Manhattan charging two former Goldman Sachs analysts with insider trading in connection with at least $6.7 million of illicit gains in the securities of several public companies. The SEC's complaint alleges that the two individuals engaged in a multi-year scheme to obtain non-public information from a variety of sources, including investment banks and financial publications. According to the complaint, beginning in late 2004, they developed, organized, and participated in two separate insider-trading schemes in which they traded on the basis of confidential information obtained from the Merrill Lynch and Business Week Schemes. In the first scheme, according to SEC filings, defendants sought to profit by obtaining confidential nonpublic details about deals that were being handled by the firms, such as mergers and acquisitions, from an account in their name at a bank in Salzburg, Austria, which was the executing broker for one of the deals. After obtaining the confidential details through an online job advertisement, Defendants then used the information to trade in Reebok International Ltd., Eon Labs, Inc., Cinergy Corp., The Gillette Company, The Coca-Cola Company and Celgene Corp. (collectively, "Reebok") and the "Inside Wall Street" column. As a result of their efforts to gain access to this information through the false postings in various press releases and in an e-mail sent to his employer, Ponzi-like payments to certain individuals residing in Europe, as well as to other individuals, some of whom were also involved in this scheme. Finally, in one instance, a European citizen tipped his father-in-law, who was also a trader at the same bank, about a series of deals involving the publication of a periodical article in The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (

Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, Louis R. Tomasetta, Eugene F. Hovanec, Yatin D. Mody, and Nicole R. Kaplan, Case No. 10 CIV 9239 (JSR). (S.D.N.Y, filed December 10, 2010)SEC CHARGES VITESSE SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION AND FOUR FORMER VITESSE EXECUTIVES IN REVENUE RECOGNITION AND OPTIONS BACKDATING SCHEMESThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges in federal district court for the Southern District of New York against California-based integrated circuit maker Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation and four former senior executives of Vitesse â co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Louis Tomasetta, former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Eugene Hovanec, former Controller and Chief Financial Officer Yatin Mody, and former Manager and Director of Finance Nicole Kaplan. The SEC alleges that Vitesse, through the former senior executives, perpetrated fraudulent and deceptive schemes during 1995 to April 2006 to inflate revenue from shipment of Vitesse's products and to backdate stock options to employees and officers by failing to record millions of dollars of compensation expense. The SEC alleges that all four former executives engaged in the revenue recognition fraud from 2001 to 2006 and that Tomasetta and Hovanec orchestrated the options backdating from 1995 to 2006. The four executives left Vitesse in 2006.Vitesse has settled the matter by agreeing to be permanently enjoined and to pay a $3 million civil penalty. Mody and Kaplan have each agreed to a bifurcated settlement that provides they will be permanently enjoined and ordered to pay disgorgement, and that any civil penalty will be determined later by the district court. Mody has also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC's case against Tomasetta and Hovanec is contested.The SEC's complaint alleges that during September 2001 through April 2006, Tomasetta, Hovanec, Mody, and Kaplan engaged in an elaborate channel stuffing scheme in order to improperly record revenue on product shipments. They caused Vitesse to immediately recognize revenue and record invalid accounts receivable for product shipped at period end to its largest distributor, even though the distributor had an unconditional right to return all of the product. The right of return was accomplished through undisclosed side letters and oral agreements. As a result, as alleged in the complaint, Vitesse materially inflated the revenue it reported in its financial statements in 14 quarters from September 2001 through early 2006.The complaint further alleges that the defendants compounded their fraudulent revenue recognition practices by failing to timely record credits related to the invalid accounts receivable that were generated by the distributor's return of product. As further alleged, in order to conceal the true age of the accounts receivable from Vitesse's external auditor, Hovanec and Kaplan then directed that cash receipts received by Vitesse from the distributor and other customers be misapplied to these aged invalid receivables.In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that from 1995 to 2006, Tomasetta and Hovanec engaged in a scheme to backdate stock option grant dates for their personal benefit and the benefit of other Vitesse executives and employees. The complaint alleges that Tomasetta and Hovanec disregarded the dates on which Vitesse's Compensation Committee actually approved and granted the options. Instead, they intentionally selected grant dates in the past based on low points in the company's stock price in order to assign favorable exercise prices for the options. They also used hindsight to reprice option grants as Vitesse's stock price declined. In total, as alleged, Tomasetta and Hovanec backdated or repriced 40 option grants to employees and officers, representing over 60% of the total options that Vitesse awarded during the period.As alleged in the complaint, Tomasetta and Hovanec collectively reaped millions of dollars in illicit profits from exercising backdated options. Despite representing in Vitesse's periodic filings made with the Commission that Vitesse did not grant in-the-money options and complied with applicable accounting rules, Tomasetta and Hovanec intentionally manipulated grant dates in order to award in-the-money options and failed to ensure that Vitesse properly recorded compensation expenses for the backdated grants. As a result of the backdating, Vitesse failed to record approximately $184 million in compensation expense, overstating its pretax income or understating its pretax loss by as much as 45% annually for its fiscal years 1996 through 2005.The complaint further alleges that after the Wall Street Journal questioned Vitesse in November 2005 about the legitimacy of its option granting practices, Tomasetta and Hovanec engaged in a cover-up to hide some of their prior backdating. As alleged in the complaint, between November 2005 and April 2006, Tomasetta and Hovanec lied to Vitesse board members and to Vitesse's auditor by falsely telling them that past option grants were proper and correctly accounted for in the company's books.The SEC alleges that in furtherance of their cover-up, Tomasetta and Hovanec fabricated minutes of two non-existent 2001 meetings during which Vitesse's Compensation Committee purportedly granted stock options. Tomasetta and Hovanec inserted these fabricated minutes into the stock option administrator's computer and turned back the clock on the computer thereby creating the false appearance that the minutes had been written at the same time as when the purported meetings occurred. Tomasetta also inserted the dates of these two phantom meetings into his Palm Pilot thereby creating the faÃ§ade that these two meetings had actually happened. Also, as further alleged, on or about December 2005, Hovanec directed his assistant to create a third set of fabricated Compensation Committee meeting minutes to substantiate another backdated grant date from 2003.Vitesse, Mody, and Kaplan have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, on the following terms:Vitesse consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9; and (2) ordering Vitesse to pay a $3 million civil penalty.Mody consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public company; (3) requiring him to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $105,604 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $56,716, for a total of $162,320; and (4) providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court will determine whether a civil penalty is appropriate and the amount of any such penalty. Mody also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.Kaplan consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) requiring her to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $31,050 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $16,445, for a total of $47,495; and (3) providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court will determine whether a civil penalty is appropriate and the amount of any such penalty. Kaplan also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, permanently suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.These settlements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The settlement with Vitesse takes into account the company's cooperation in the SEC's investigation.The complaint against Tomasetta and Hovanec alleges that each of them violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, lying to auditors, and equity transaction reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Tomasetta is also charged with violating the proxy provisions of the Exchange Act. The complaint also alleges that Tomasetta and Hovanec violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were false and misleading. The SEC's complaint against Tomasetta and Hovanec seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with interest, civil monetary penalties, and officer and director bars.Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today filed criminal charges against Tomasetta and Hovanec, and announced that Mody and Kaplan have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

No. 07 CV 1774 (S.D.N.Y) (PKC)  SEC Charges 14 Defendants in Wall Street Insider Trading Ring, Including Personnel at UBS Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc.    The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against fourteen defendants in connection with two related insider trading schemes in which Wall Street professionals serially traded on material, nonpublic information tipped, in exchange for cash kickbacks, by insiders at UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. The complaint alleges that in the first scheme, which has been ongoing since 2001, at least eight securities industry professionals, three hedge funds, two broker-dealers and a day-trading firm, made thousands of illegal trades and millions of dollars in illicit profits using inside information misappropriated by a UBS executive to trade ahead of UBS analyst recommendations (the "UBS Scheme"). The complaint alleges that in the second scheme, several securities industry professionals and a hedge fund made dozens of illegal trades and hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits using inside information misappropriated by an attorney at Morgan Stanley to trade ahead of corporate acquisition announcements (the "Morgan Stanley Scheme"). Collectively, the complaint alleges, the defendants made at least $15 million in illicit profits from these two insider trading schemes.  The Commission's complaint alleges that in the UBS Scheme, from at least 2001 through 2006, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department of UBS, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to at least two Wall Street traders, Erik R. Franklin and David M. Tavdy, in exchange for sharing in the illicit profits from their trading on that information.  According to the complaint, Franklin illegally traded on inside information in his personal accounts and for two hedge funds he managed: Lyford Cay Capital, LP, a hedge fund at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. and Q Capital Investment Partners, LP. Franklin also traded in his and his father-in-law's personal accounts. The complaint alleges that to avoid detection of this scheme, Guttenberg used coded text messages on disposable cell phones to communicate the tips to Franklin and arrange meeting places where Franklin would pay Guttenberg his share of illegal profits in cash. The complaint further alleges that Tavdy illegally traded on this inside information for Andover Brokerage, LLC and Assent LLC, registered broker-dealers where Tavdy was a proprietary trader. According to the complaint, Tavdy also traded on this inside information stolen from UBS in his personal account, the accounts of a relative and friend, and the accounts of Jasper Capital LLC, a day-trading firm with which Tavdy was associated.  The Commission further alleges that Franklin and Tavdy also had downstream tippees who traded on the UBS tips. Franklin tipped Mark E. Lenowitz, who illegally traded on this inside information for DSJ International Resources Ltd. (doing business as "Chelsey Capital"), a private hedge fund where Lenowitz was a portfolio manager, and in his personal accounts. As alleged in the complaint, three registered representatives at Bear Stearns who knew of Franklin's UBS tips (Robert D. Babcock, Andrew A. Srebnik, and Ken Okada) also illegally traded on this inside information in their personal accounts and, in the case of Babcock, for the Lyford Cay hedge fund. Additionally, the complaint alleges, David A. Glass, the owner of Jasper Capital, a day-trading firm that operated from the New York City offices of Assent, also traded on Tavdy's UBS tips for Jasper Capital. According to the complaint, Glass and Tavdy paid kickbacks to supervisory personnel at Assent to not disclose this trading scheme. Collectively, the complaint alleges, Guttenberg, Franklin, Tavdy, and their tippees made at least $14 million in illegal profits from the UBS Scheme.  The complaint alleges that, in the Morgan Stanley Scheme, several of the participants in the UBS Scheme, and others, traded ahead of corporate acquisition announcements using inside information stolen by an in-house lawyer at Morgan Stanley. In this scheme, according to the complaint, Randi Collotta, an attorney who worked in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, together with her husband, Christopher Collotta, an attorney in private practice, tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley's investment banking clients, to Marc Jurman, a registered representative in Florida, in exchange for sharing in Jurman's illicit profits from trading on this information.

Securities and Exchange Commission Charges Five Wall Street Professionals in Two Insider Trading Schemes   The Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging insider trading schemes in which eight securities industry professionals, three hedge funds, two broker-dealers, and a day-trading firm made thousands of illegal trades and millions of dollars in illicit profits using inside information provided by an executive of UBS and Morgan Stanley to trade ahead of analyst recommendations.

SEC Sues National Lampoon, Inc. and Others for Wide-Ranging Market Manipulation Schemes  Daniel S. Laikin, National Lampoon's CEO, Charged with Paying Kickbacks in Exchange for Manipulating the Market for National Lampoon's Stock  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it charged seven individuals and two corporations with engaging in three separate fraudulent schemes to manipulate the market for publicly traded securities through the payment of prearranged kickbacks. The defendants include National Lampoon, Inc. and its CEO, Daniel S. Laikin, as well as stock promoters, a consultant, and an officer of another company. The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today separately announced criminal charges involving the same conduct.  The Commission's actions, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, allege that, in each case, individuals who controlled the stock of a public company arranged with corrupt promoters and others to generate purchases of the company's stock in exchange for cash kickbacks. In each case, a witness secretly cooperating with the government (the "CW") was paid a kickback to make purchases in the stock. The goal of the manipulators was to create the appearance of market interest, induce public purchases of the stock, and ultimately increase the stock's trading price. For example, the Commission alleges that Daniel Laikin and another defendant paid at least $68,000 in cash kickbacks for the purchase of National Lampoon stock in order to artificially inflate the stock price.  The Commission's complaints allege as follows:  SEC v. National Lampoon, Inc. et al.  Defendants: National Lampoon, Inc., headquartered in Los Angeles, California, is a media and entertainment company that develops, produces and distributes media projects including feature films, television programming, online and interactive entertainment, home video, and book publishing. The company produced such widely known films as National Lampoon's Animal House, and the National Lampoon Vacation series. National Lampoon's common stock is registered with the Commission and is listed on the NYSE Alternext, formerly the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX"). Daniel S. Laikin, of Los Angeles, California, has been the Chief Executive Officer of National Lampoon since 2005. Laikin controls approximately 40 percent of the voting stock of National Lampoon. Dennis S. Barsky, of Las Vegas, Nevada, is a consultant to National Lampoon, and a significant stockholder. Eduardo Rodriguez, of Livingston, New Jersey, is a stock promoter. Tim Dougherty, of Webster, New York, is a stock promoter and principal of OTC Advisors, Inc., a stock promotion company.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least March 2008 through June 2008, Laikin, Barsky, Rodriguez and Dougherty engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of National Lampoon. Specifically, Laikin, along with Barsky, paid kickbacks in exchange for generating or causing purchases of National Lampoon stock to Rodriguez, a corrupt stock promoter, and the CW, whom Laikin, Barsky and Rodriguez believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives. As part of this scheme, Dougherty generated purchases of National Lampoon stock in exchange for a portion of the kickbacks. Dougherty made his purchases over the course of a number of days and used various accounts to give the false impression of a steady demand for the stock.  The complaint alleges that Laikin and Barsky paid at least $68,000 that went to Rodriguez, Dougherty, and the CW to cause the purchase of at least 87,500 shares of National Lampoon stock. Through these efforts, Laikin and Barsky sought to artificially push National Lampoon's stock price from under $2 per share to at least $5 per share, in part, to keep the company's stock price above the minimum listing requirements of the AMEX, and to increase National Lampoon's ability to enter into possible "strategic partnerships" and acquisitions. In addition to paying others to purchase the stock, Laikin shared confidential financial information regarding National Lampoon, non-public news releases, and confidential shareholder lists, and coordinated the release of news with the illegal purchases in the stock. Barsky helped direct the purchases and facilitated the kickback payments. National Lampoon and Laikin also made materially misleading statements in a tender offer.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b) and 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13e-4 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, from the individual defendants, and an officer and director bar against Laikin.  SEC v. Advatech Corporation, et al.  Defendant Advatech Corporation is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida. It describes itself as an early stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development for the commercialization of products for non-invasive therapeutic medicine. Advatech's securities trade on the grey market. Grey market stocks have no market makers, and are not listed, traded or quoted on any stock exchange, or the over-the-counter bulletin board. However, customers may trade through brokers on an unsolicited basis, and trading data is publicly available throughout the trading day. Defendant Richard J. Margulies, of Edison, New Jersey, is Advatech's Chief Financial Officer and a member of its board of directors. Margulies owns and/or controls a significant portion of Advatech stock either directly or through nominees.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least May 2008 through June 2008, Margulies engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Advatech's common stock. In furtherance of the scheme, Margulies arranged to pay a 20 percent kickback to Rodriguez and the CW for purchases of Advatech stock. Before Rodriguez and the CW made the illegal purchases, Margulies provided them with shareholder lists, confidential information about the company, and non-public press releases. Margulies coordinated the release of news with the purchases, said that he wanted to increase Advatech's stock price from approximately $0.30 to $2.00 per share, and instructed Rodriguez and the CW that they should "move [the stock] up nice and slow, so it doesn't look like we're a bunch of idiots."  The complaint alleges that, to effectuate his scheme, Margulies paid at least $1,040 in kickbacks as partial payments to the CW in exchange for purchases of at least 5,000 shares of Advatech stock on June 17 and 18, 2008.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Advatech and Margulies, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Margulies.  SEC v. Alex Kanakaris, et al.  Defendants Alex Kanakaris, of Newport Beach, California, and Richard Epstein, of Parkland, Florida, are stock promoters who are significant investors in the stock of SwedishVegas, Inc., headquartered in Arcadia, California, whose stated business plan is to "launch a series of themed eateries with an extensive beer and wine menu and reasonably priced lunches, dinners and appetizers." Until July 23, 2008, when the Commission suspended trading in its stock, SwedishVegas common stock was quoted on an inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system in the over-the-counter securities market which is operated by Pink OTC Markets, Inc., commonly known as the "Pink Sheets."  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least June through July 2008, Kanakaris and Epstein engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of SwedishVegas. Specifically, the defendants paid a kickback to Rodriguez, a corrupt stock promoter, and the CW, whom they believed had connections to corrupt stockbrokers, to buy Swedish Vegas stock in an effort to create the appearance of market interest, induce public purchases of stock, and ultimately increase the stock's trading price. At one point, Kanakaris told Rodriguez and the CW that he wanted them to buy as much stock as possible in order to make the stock price "fly."  The complaint further alleges that, in accordance with their scheme, Kanakaris and Epstein paid at least $15,000 to Rodriguez and the CW in exchange for completed purchases of at least 125,000 shares of SwedishVegas stock on July 22, 2008. After this initial stock purchase, actually made with FBI funds, the Commission suspended trading in the stock.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars from the defendants.  In addition to the enforcement actions, the Commission today entered an order suspending trading in the securities of National Lampoon, Inc. and Advatech Corporation for a ten day period commencing 9:30 a.m. December 15, 2008.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).    Complaint v.

Pa.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER CEO OF NATIONAL LAMPON, INC. AND TWO OTHER COMPANIES WITH FRAUDULENT SCHEME TO MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR PENNSYLVANIA STOCK PROMOTER  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charging the former CEO, CFO, and two stock promoters with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for shares of the company's stock.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least March 2008 through June 2008, Daniel S. Laikin, a Los Angeles, California resident, paid kickbacks in exchange for generating or causing purchases of stock to a stock promoter and the Cooperating Witness (CW), an individual whom they believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives. In reality, the CW was, at all times, cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The complaint further alleges that, as part of this scheme, Dougherty generated purchases for himself and others in order to keep the stock price above the minimum listing requirements of a publicly traded stock exchange. The Commission alleges, however, that the defendants never disclosed the manipulative scheme and made materially misleading statements in connection with their July 17, 2007 tender offer to acquire the shares in an offer that was not subject to approval by the SEC. As a result of their illegal activity, these shares were sold at a profit and at the price of $5.00 per share, which would have artificially boosted the share price. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this offer and sale of shares, LaIKin and Barsky agreed to pay $68,000 in kickback payments to Rodriguez, who, in turn, received $16,666 in incentive payments for his purchase of one million shares and $8,333 to another individual who was similarly unable to purchase the same shares. According, according to Laiki, Rodriguez was the only person who had the ability to generate such purchases and to induce other investors to buy stock, thereby increasing the trading volume and thereby causing the

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20021 / February 28, 2007  SEC v. Louis W. Zehil, et al., Civil Action No. 07CV1439 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC Charges Corporate Attorney With Securities Fraud and Obtains Asset Freeze    The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an injunctive action in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that from approximately January 2006 to February 2007, Louis W. Zehil ("Zehil"), a corporate attorney, and two entities he controlled, Strong Branch Ventures IV LP ("Strong") and Chestnut Capital Partners II, LLC ("Chestnut"), engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain and sell to the investing public millions of shares of securities in violation of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. With the consent of the parties, Judge Preska entered an order granting a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, the appointment of a receiver and other relief.  Zehil, age 41, was until recently a partner with the law firm of McGuireWoods LLP. Zehil is a resident of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida and worked at the firm's offices in New York, New York, and Jacksonville, Florida.  The Complaint alleges that between January 2006 and February 2007, Zehil represented seven public companies in issuing their stock in PIPE transactions (private investments in public equity). The seven public companies were Gran Tierra Energy, Inc., Foothills Resources, Inc., MMC Energy, Inc., Alternative Energy Sources, Inc., Ethanex Energy, Inc., GoFish Corp., and Kreido BioFuels, Inc. At all relevant times, their common stock was registered with the Commission and quoted on the OTC-BB. In these PIPE transactions (as in PIPEs generally), the investors purchased restricted stock at a discount to market price.  The Complaint also alleges that Zehil personally invested in the issuers' PIPE transactions through Strong and Chestnut. In the subscription agreements for each PIPE transaction, the Defendants agreed (as all the PIPE subscribers did) that the shares they received would be issued with restrictive legends until such time as the issuers filed registration statements with the Commission and the Commission declared them effective. As counsel for the issuers, Zehil then sent letters to the issuers' transfer agents directing the issuance of shares to the PIPE subscribers. Zehil's letters instructed that all the shares should bear restrictive legends except the shares issued to his entities, Strong and Chestnut. Zehil's letters stated, falsely, that the shares issued to Strong and Chestnut satisfied legal criteria to be issued without restrictive legend. As a result of their fraudulent conduct, the Defendants were able to receive shares without restrictive legends, which they quickly sold into the public market, and generated illicit profits of at least $17 million &nbsp; The complaint charges Zehil, Strong and Chestnut with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court granted, among other relief, a preliminary injunction order which included an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver over Strong and Chestnut. In its enforcement action, the Commission is seeking additional relief, including orders permanently enjoining Zehil, Strong and Chestnut from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering Zehil, Strong and Chestnut to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, between January 2006 and February 2007, Zehl represented seven public companies in issuing their shares in PIPE transactions (private investments in public equity). The seven issuers were Gran Tierra Energy, Inc., Foothills Resources Inc. and MMC Energy Inc.; Alternative Energy Sources Inc.'s (âAdvisers&#8212;), Ethanex Energy Ltd., GoFish Corp., and Kreido Biofuels, a Delaware limited liability company.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19107 \ March 1, 2005  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2204 \ March 1, 2005  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. THE TITAN CORPORATION, Civil Action No. 05-0411 (D.D.C.) (JR) (filed March 1, 2005)  SEC SUES THE TITAN CORPORATION FOR PAYMENTS TO ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF BENIN PRESIDENT TITAN SETTLES AND AGREES TO PAY A TOTAL OF MORE THAN $28 MILLION TO SETTLE SEC ACTION AND RELATED CRIMINAL ACTION TITAN PLEADS GUILTY IN RELATED CRIMINAL ACTION BROUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FRAUD SECTION SEC ALSO ISSUES REPORT OF INVESTIGATION TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE CONCERNING MATERIAL PROVISIONS IN MERGER AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS   The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled enforcement action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging The Titan Corporation ("Titan"), a San Diego, California-based military intelligence and communications company, with violating the anti-bribery, internal controls and books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA").  Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission's complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, Titan consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and requiring it (i) to pay $15.479 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, (ii) to pay a $13 million penalty, which will be deemed satisfied by Titan's payment of criminal fines of that amount in parallel proceedings brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, and (iii) to retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA compliance and procedures and to adopt and implement the consultant's recommendations.   The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 1999 to 2001, Titan paid more than $3.5 million to its agent in Benin, Africa, who was known at the time by Titan to be the President of Benin's business advisor.  Titan failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence into the background of its agent either before his retention or thereafter and also failed to ensure that the services alleged to be performed by the agent, and described in his invoices, were in fact provided to Titan.  The complaint alleges, in 2001, at the direction of at least one former senior Titan officer based in the United States, Titan funneled approximately $2 million, via its agent in Benin, towards the election campaign of Benin's then-incumbent President.  The complaint also alleges that some of these funds were used to reimburse Titan's agent for the purchase to T-shirts adorned with the President's picture and instructions to vote for him in the upcoming election.  According to the complaint, Titan made these payments to assist the company in its development of a telecommunications project in Benin and to obtain the Benin government's consent to an increase in the percentage of Titan's project management fees for that project.  The complaint alleges that a former senior Titan officer directed that these payments be falsely invoiced by the agent as consulting services and that actual payment of the money be broken into smaller increments and spread out over time.  The complaint does not allege that the then-incumbent President knew of the payments.   The Commission's complaint also alleges that, from 1999 to 2003, Titan improperly recorded payments in its books and records, directed agents to falsify invoices submitted to Titan, and failed to devise or maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect other FCPA violations.  Despite utilizing over 120 agents and consultants in over 60 countries, Titan never had a formal company-wide FCPA policy, failed to implement an FCPA compliance program, disregarded or circumvented the limited FCPA policies and procedures in effect, failed to maintain sufficient due diligence files on its foreign agents, and failed to have meaningful oversight over its foreign agents.  According to the complaint, Titan falsified documents that enabled its agents to under-report local commission payments in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Titan falsified documents presented to the United States government by under-reporting payments on equipment exported to Sri Lanka, France and Japan.  The complaint also alleges that Titan (i) paid a World Bank Group analyst in cash to assist Titan in its project in Benin, and (ii) paid a Benin government official approximately $14,000 in travel expenses from 1999 to 2001.   Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Titan has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Titan also has agreed to disgorge $12,620,000, and to pay prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $2,859,195.47.  Under the terms of the final judgment, Titan will also retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA compliance and procedures and will adopt and implement the consultant's recommendations.   Also today the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section filed criminal FCPA charges and a tax charge against Titan, who entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Roger T. Benitez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California (United States of America v. Titan Corporation, Case No.05cr0314-BEN (S.D. Cal.)).  In particular, Titan agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one felony count for falsifying the books and records of Titan, and one felony count for violating Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7206(2) and to pay a criminal fine of $13 million. Commission's Report Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act The Commission also today issued a Report of Investigation pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act to provide guidance concerning potential liability under the antifraud and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws for publication of materially false or misleading disclosures regarding provisions in merger and other contractual agreements.   In its Report, the Commission stated that, on September 15, 2003, Titan became a party to a merger agreement with Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed") in which Lockheed agreed to acquire Titan, pending certain contingencies.  Titan affirmatively represented in that merger agreement that to the knowledge of Titan, neither the company "nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has taken any action which would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of the FCPA."  This representation was publicly disclosed and disseminated by Titan in two places.  The proxy statement disclosed the nature of the representation.  The merger agreement containing the representation was also appended to Titan's proxy statement, which was filed with the Commission and sent to Titan's shareholders.     As the Report highlights, when an issuer makes a public disclosure of information -- via filing a proxy statement or otherwise -- the issuer is required to consider whether additional disclosure is necessary in order to put the information contained in, or otherwise incorporated into that publication, into context so that such information is not misleading.  The issuer cannot avoid this disclosure obligation simply because the information published was contained in an agreement or other document not prepared as a disclosure document.   The Report is not intended to change the way issuers engage in merger, or other contractual, negotiations or to alter existing diligence obligations or to suggest, absent special circumstances (such as provisions intended to create third party beneficiaries), that provisions such as representations and covenants in such agreements are binding on or intended to benefit persons other than parties thereto.  Representations, covenants, or other provisions of an agreement made by an issuer that are not public or disclosed to shareholders are not covered by the scope of this Report.  The Commission will consider bringing an enforcement action under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder in the future if it determines that the subject matter of representations or other contractual provisions is materially misleading to shareholders because material facts necessary to make that disclosure not misleading are omitted.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance in this investigation from the Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Diego Division; the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigations; and the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service.   The Commission's investigation is continuing.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the San Diego-based Titan Corporation ("Titan"), alleging that Titan violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") by paying over $3.5 million to its agent in Benin, Africa ("Benin Agent"), who was known at the time to be Titan's business advisor. According to the complaint, Titan made these payments to assist the company in its development of a telecommunication system project, and to obtain the government's consent to an increase of the percentage of project project management fees Titan paid. Titan also failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence into the background of this agent, either before or after his retention or thereafter. In its complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that from 1999 to December 2001, at least one former Titan officer and several former senior Titan officers, or executives, knew and/or approved of some or all of Titanâs FCPA violations, including the payment of approximately $2.6 million in commissions to a government agent and $1.1 million for consulting services in connection with the contract with a subsidiary of Datron World Communications ("DWC"), a division of which Titan was a part. As a result of these actions, on November 30, 2001 Titan, a publicly-traded company, was acquired by the New York Stock Exchange ("NSE") and subsequently sold its entire portfolio of telecommunications equipment and services to two entities controlled by Titan: Titan Africa Inc. ("Agronetwork"), and Titan International, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that is now known as DWC. At the direction of one of its former officers and former executives based in California, one Titan executive directed Titan to submit numerous false documents to NSE and the SEC to determine whether the contracts included monies paid to foreign agents. Among other things, these documents falsely described that "titanium has made substantial contributions to social programs and a new telephone system" when, in fact, most of those payments were made to pay Titan executives in other countries, rather than to support the election campaign for that president of Ben

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20829 / December 15, 2008  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2911 / December 15, 2008  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Civil Action No. 08 CV 02167 (D.D.C.)  SEC Files Settled Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges Against Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide Bribery With Total Disgorgement and Criminal Fines of Over $1.6 Billion  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on December 12, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Siemens Aktiengesellschaft ("Siemens"), a Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of industrial and consumer products, with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). Siemens has offered to pay a total of $1.6 billion in disgorgement and fines, which is the largest amount a company has ever paid to resolve corruption-related charges. Siemens has agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to the SEC. In related actions, Siemens will pay a $450 million criminal fine to the U.S. Department of Justice and a fine of &#128;395 million (approximately $569 million) to the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany. Siemens previously paid a fine of &#128;201 million (approximately $285 million) to the Munich Prosecutor in October 2007.  The SEC's complaint alleges that:  Between March 12, 2001 and September 30, 2007, Siemens violated the FCPA by engaging in a widespread and systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain business. Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of its corrupt payments, and the company's inadequate internal controls allowed the conduct to flourish. The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA.  During this period, Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the money. At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens around the world. Among others, Siemens paid bribes on transactions to design and build metro transit lines in Venezuela; metro trains and signaling devices in China; power plants in Israel; high voltage transmission lines in China; mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh; telecommunications projects in Nigeria; national identity cards in Argentina; medical devices in Vietnam, China, and Russia; traffic control systems in Russia; refineries in Mexico; and mobile communications networks in Vietnam. Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned over $1.1 billion in profits on these transactions.  An additional approximately 1,185 separate payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million were not properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for illicit purposes, including commercial bribery and embezzlement.  From 1999 to 2003, Siemens' Managing Board or "Vorstand" was ineffective in implementing controls to address constraints imposed by Germany's 1999 adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") anti-bribery convention that outlawed foreign bribery. The Vorstand was also ineffective in meeting the U.S. regulatory and anti-bribery requirements that Siemens was subject to following its March 12, 2001, listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite knowledge of bribery at two of its largest groups &#8212; Communications and Power Generation &#8212; the company's tone at the top was inconsistent with an effective FCPA compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was tolerated and even rewarded at the highest levels of the company. Employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash desks, which were sometimes transported in suitcases across international borders for bribery. Authorizations for payments were placed on post-it notes and later removed to eradicate any permanent record. Siemens used numerous slush funds, off-books accounts maintained at unconsolidated entities, and a system of business consultants and intermediaries to facilitate the corrupt payments.  Siemens failed to implement adequate internal controls to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA. Elaborate payment mechanisms were used to conceal the fact that bribe payments were made around the globe to obtain business. False invoices and payment documentation was created to make payments to business consultants under false business consultant agreements that identified services that were never intended to be rendered. Illicit payments were falsely recorded as expenses for management fees, consulting fees, supply contracts, room preparation fees, and commissions. Siemens inflated U.N. contracts, signed side agreements with Iraqi ministries that were not disclosed to the U.N., and recorded the ASSF payments as legitimate commissions despite U.N., U.S., and international sanctions against such payments.  In November 2006, Siemens' current management began to implement reforms to the company's internal controls. These reforms substantially reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt payments occurred before November 15, 2006. The company conducted a massive internal investigation and implemented an amnesty program to its employees to gather information.  Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the payments in its books.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Siemens has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include profits factored into Munich's fine; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an independent monitor for a period of four years. On December 15, 2008, the court entered the final judgment. Since being approached by SEC staff, Siemens has cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation, and the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Siemens. Siemens' massive internal investigation and lower level employee amnesty program was essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of Siemens' FCPA violations.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that, between March 12, 2001 and September 29, 2007 (the "Relevant Period"), the German manufacturer of industrial and consumer products made thousands of separate payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe government authorities in several countries, including Venezuela, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, and Iraq. The Commission's complaint also alleges that at least $27.5 million of these payments were made prior to November 15, 2006, when the company's current management began to implement reforms to improve its internal controls. According to the complaint, the improper payments involved employees at all levels of the Company's business group and involved a corporate culture that had long been at odds with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The complaint further alleges, during the relevant period, that the bribery scheme was a widespread and systematic practice that involved paying bribes to third parties in exchange for business from the end of 2001 through the first quarter of 2007. In addition, SiemENS paid over $2 billion in kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (UNODG).   In its complaint filed today in federal district court in Washington, DC, unsealed on September 20 the SEC's previously filed charges against the former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and CFO, for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to pay bribes in violation of FCPA provisions. Without admitting or denying the allegations, former senior management and former employees agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-bribery, books-and-records and internal-controls provisions of Sections 5(a), 6(c), and 13(b)(2)(A) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5a-14, 5b2-1 and 5d-2 thereunder.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20811 / November 18, 2008  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2901 / November 18, 2008  SEC v. David Lee, et al., Civil Action No. 08-CIV-9961 (GBD) (SDNY)  SEC Charges Banker And Brokerage Executives With Multimillion Dollar Financial Fraud  On November 18, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging four individuals with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to overvalue the commodity derivatives trading portfolio at Bank of Montreal ("BMO"), and thereby inflate BMO's publicly reported financial results. The defendants include a former senior derivatives trader at BMO and the top two senior executive officers of Optionable, Inc. ("Optionable"), a publicly traded commodities brokerage firm.  The defendants named in the Commission's complaint are:  David Lee ("Lee"), age 36, resides in New Jersey. Lee was a natural gas options trader employed by BMO Capital Markets Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMO and a registered broker-dealer, until he resigned on May 15, 2007. From 2001 through 2004, Lee was a Vice President of BMO's Commodity Derivatives Group, the unit through which BMO traded commodity derivatives. In 2005, he was promoted to Managing Director of that group.  Kevin P. Cassidy ("Cassidy"), age 49, resides in Bedford Hills, New York. Cassidy was one of Optionable's founders and served as Vice Chairman of Optionable's board of directors until he resigned on May 12, 2007. Except for the period from March 2004 to October 2005, he was also Optionable's CEO throughout the relevant period.  Edward O'Connor ("O'Connor"), age 55, resides in Briarcliff Manor, New York. O'Connor was one of Optionable's founders and since 2001, he has served as President and a director of Optionable. From March 2004 through October 2005, he was also Optionable's CEO and Treasurer.  Scott Connor ("Connor"), age 31, resides in Rye, New York. Connor was employed by Optionable as a commodities broker until May 2007.  The Commission's complaint specifically alleges as follows:  Lee fraudulently overvalued BMO's portfolio of natural gas options by deliberately "mismarking" trading positions for which market prices were unavailable. Lee recorded inflated values that were then purportedly validated by Optionable, which held itself out to BMO and the public as a legitimate provider of independent derivatives valuation services. In fact, Cassidy, O'Connor and Connor schemed with Lee to have Optionable simply rubber-stamp whatever inflated values Lee recorded. After the scheme was discovered, BMO restated its financial results by reducing net income for the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year by approximately $237 million Canadian dollars ($204 million USD), which reflects a 68% overstatement of BMO's net income for that quarter.  BMO was Optionable's largest customer, and BMO trades accounted for as much as 60% of Optionable's commodity brokerage business. Lee's trading accounted for virtually all of BMO's business with Optionable. As a result, Optionable's management, led by Cassidy, was willing to do whatever it took to keep Lee satisfied. When market prices were unavailable, BMO's risk management personnel sought to verify the accuracy of BMO's commodity derivatives traders' valuations of their positions, or their "marks," by obtaining supposedly independent valuations, or "quotes," for those positions from one or more third parties. During the relevant period, Optionable was the primary source of the third-party quotes that BMO used to validate Lee's marks. Lee provided his marks directly to Cassidy, O'Connor or Connor, who then simply forwarded Lee's marks, virtually unchanged, to BMO's risk management department as if they were Optionable's independent quotes. At first, Lee used this "u-turn" scheme to boost his trading profits and incentive compensation, but in 2006, the market turned against Lee and he used the scheme to hide substantial trading losses. In May 2007, BMO concluded that due to the Optionable scheme and other positions that Lee had also mismarked, Lee's trading book was overvalued by an aggregate total of $680 million (CAD) since the beginning of BMO's fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.  Cassidy and O'Connor also defrauded Optionable's public shareholders by concealing Optionable's role in the scheme. Optionable's periodic reports touted the synergistic benefits of the derivatives valuation services that Optionable purportedly provided to multiple brokerage clients, but those reports, which Cassidy and O'Connor signed, never disclosed that BMO was the principal client for whom those "services" were performed and that the "valuation services" provided to BMO were a sham designed to defraud BMO. In addition, Cassidy and O'Connor defrauded the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") by selling over $10 million of their own Optionable stock to NYMEX in April 2007. Both Cassidy and O'Connor represented to NYMEX that Optionable's periodic reports were materially accurate, but they never disclosed anything about their scheme with Lee to defraud the shareholders of BMO, Optionable's largest customer. On May 9, 2007, one day after BMO announced that it had placed Lee on leave and suspended its business relationship with Optionable, Optionable issued an announcement stating that the suspension would have an adverse effect on Optionable's business. Optionable's stock price fell almost 40% that day, from $4.64 to $2.81 per share, and dropped to below 50 cents per share one week later after Cassidy's prior criminal record was disclosed in press reports.  All four defendants are charged with committing violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; and with aiding and abetting BMO's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16. The complaint further charges Cassidy, O'Connor and Connor with aiding and abetting Optionable's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, and also charges Cassidy and O'Connor with violating Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. As to each defendant, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The complaint also seeks an order barring Cassidy and O'Connor from acting as officers or directors of a public company.  The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York ("USAO"), the New York County District Attorney's Office ("NYCDA"), and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") also filed parallel criminal and regulatory charges today arising from the same conduct that is alleged in the Commission's complaint. Lee pled guilty to parallel criminal charges filed by the USAO and the NYCDA. In connection with his guilty plea, Lee agreed to pay a total of $4.41 million in forfeiture.  Lee has agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission's claims for disgorgement and civil penalties against Lee, and all of its claims against the other three defendants, remain pending.  The Commission's investigation is continuing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the USAO, NYCDA, CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

("BMO") with fraud in connection with a long-running scheme to overvalue the company's natural gas options trading portfolio by deliberately "mismarking" trading positions for which market prices were unavailable.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, in May 2007, one of the traders engaged in this fraudulent scheme by artificially inflating the value of his trading book by regularly recording inflated values that were then purportedly validated by Optionable, Inc., a publicly-traded commodities brokerage firm where the trader worked. The complaint also charges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(A) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 14a-2 thereunder and with aiding and abetting the Defendants' violations of Section 20(e) the Securities Act and Sections 13 (a), 13 and 15(d) in Section 17(A)(1), and (2) under Section 13 of The Securities Code of Conduct (Securities Act) (the "Defendants"). The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and officer and director bars against all defendants, as well as the imposition of penny stock bars and an officer-and-director bar against each defendant. In a parallel action, on May 5, 2006, a federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y. entered a temporary restraining order against Lee from violating the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions (Section 13, Section 5) or (ii) Section 15 (A.B.D.).

The SEC also charged the operator with making false and misleading statements in connection with an unregistered offering of securities.  The SEC alleges that BitFunder and its founder, Jon E. Montroll, operated BitFunder as an unregistered online securities exchange and defrauded exchange users by misappropriating their bitcoins and failing to disclose a cyberattack on BitFunder's system that resulted in the theft of more than 6,000 bitcoins.

Generated Summary:
On February 21, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Jon E. Montroll and his company, BitFunder, with defrauding investors by misappropriating their funds and failing to disclose a cyberattack that resulted in the theft of more than 6,000 bitcoins.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, from December 2012 through November 2013, Montrolling operated Bitfunder as an unregistered securities exchange through which users could create, offer, buy and sell virtual "shares" of various virtual currency-related enterprises in exchange for bitcoins, which were then used to pay personal and business expenses, and to replenish bitcoins that had been stolen from the WeExchange wallet. The complaint further alleges that, over the course of five weeks, a group of Bitdefender users engaged in a Cyberattack on the BitDefender's platform, resulting in an estimated $8.5 million in bitcoins being stolen. In a parallel action, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief to halt the alleged theft and freeze the assets of the two defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations.Â  The court also froze the defendants' assets and ordered the repatriation of all assets held by the Commission and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida.The SEC alleges in its complaint that from at least July 2013 until the end of November 2014, Defendants, in connection with their alleged fraudulent conduct, misused investor funds to make payments to investors, including for personal expenses and for other purposes, such as to purchase shares of bitcoins in secondary market transactions. As a result of this conduct by Defendants and their companies, bitcoins were taken out of public view and used as a hedge fund to repay earlier investors. Without providing any evidence, defendants consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty, to be determined at a later date by a court hearing on February 20, 2019, for a total of $1.2 million.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an emergency asset freeze and temporary restraining order against a Chicago-based investment adviser and his financial management company accused of scamming elderly investors out of millions of dollars.  The SEC alleges that Daniel H. Glick and his unregistered investment advisory firm Financial Management Strategies (FMS) provided clients with false account statements to hide Glick's use of client funds to pay personal and business expenses, purchase a Mercedes-Benz, and pay off loans and debts among other misuses.  According to the SEC's complaint, Glick was barred by FINRA in 2014 and had his Certified Financial Planner designation and Certified Public Accountant license revoked for conduct unrelated to today's SEC charges.  The SEC's complaint also names Glick Accounting Services, Glick's business partner David B. Slagter, and Glick's business acquaintance Edward H. Forte as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering client funds that Glick transferred or paid them in the form of advances or loans.  The complaint alleges that Glick and FMS violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The court issued a temporary restraining order against Glick and FMS at the SEC's request, and issued an order freezing the assets of Glick, FMS, and Glick Accounting Services.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michelle MuÃ±oz Durk and John Kustusch, and the case is being supervised by Jeffrey A. Shank.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Steven C. Seeger.  The SEC's examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Terrence Bohan, Michael Altschuler, and Christine Little, and it was supervised by Rosanne Smith.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an Illinois-based investment adviser with defrauding senior citizens who entrusted him with their retirement savings.  The SEC alleges that Daniel H. Glick and two companies he controlled, Financial Management Strategies, Inc. and G.B. Slagter, misappropriated more than $1.5 million of the investors' money for personal use, including using investor funds to repay other investors and to pay expenses for his own businesses. According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the funds were pooled with investor assets and used to make investments in securities and other securities. The complaint further alleges the defendants lied to investors about the amount of their investments and the nature of those investments, and falsely told investors that their money would be used only for their benefit. In reality, according to one investor, more money was being used for other purposes, such as to purchase a Mercedes Benz for a family member, or to fund the mortgage on a home that was sold at a profit. As alleged in a separate SEC complaint, in 2013 and 2014, a third investor received over $900,000 from the same family, but none of these funds was ever used as intended. Instead of using the money as promised, as investors were told he would use it to invest their funds and pay their expenses, investors instead commingled investor money with his personal funds, with the understanding that he could use the rest of it for legitimate business purposes and not for any other purpose. Among the relief defendants are Edward H.' Forte of Palos Heights, Ill., and David Slagle of Chicago, Illinois. Both are friends and business associates of Glicks. They are members of his extended extended family and are invested in his companies, which provided tax and accounting services to individual and corporate tax clients and payroll management services for small businesses, respectively. Their investments were made with funds from their own accounts and were not segregated from other investor accounts. However, they did not have the right to pool their investment funds with other funds in their personal bank accounts, nor were they able to use them as they had previously been promised. To make up for these misstatements and misstatement of funds received from investors, defendants made numerous false statements in investor account statements and provided investors with false information about how they were using their assets. For example, one defendant falsely claimed to have obtained a CPA license from FINRA based

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against a Florida man who allegedly bought stock in the biotechnology company where his sibling worked based on confidential drug trial information misappropriated from the sibling.  According to the SEC's complaint, Stephen J. Leonard, a resident of Palm Harbor, Florida, made $107,000 in illicit profits by trading in the stock of Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a California-based biotechnology company where his sibling worked in a senior position, before Puma announced positive clinical trial results for its cancer drug.  As alleged in the complaint, from May 11 through July 18, 2014, Leonard and his sibling had four telephone conversations.  During those conversations, the sibling allegedly shared material, nonpublic information about Puma's drug trial with Leonard, trusting and expecting that he would keep the information confidential.  But, after each conversation, Leonard bought Puma stock based on material, non-public information, breaching a duty of trust and confidence to his sibling.  Leonard's final purchases of Puma stock were made on July 22, 2014, just hours before Puma publicly announced the positive results from its drug trial.  After the announcement, Puma's stock price nearly quadrupled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges Leonard with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Leonard consented to the entry of a final judgment that provides permanent injunctive relief under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and orders him to pay $107,000 in disgorgement, $11,996.86 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $107,000, for a total of $225,996.86.

On December 6, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York charging two individuals and their companies with securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least January 2014 to September 2015, James A. Cohen, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, and his company, Centra Financial Services, Inc. ("Centra"), engaged in a series of fraudulent transactions to defraud investors, many of whom were senior citizens. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the issuers' offering of securities, including the issuance of promissory notes to investors and the sale of unregistered brokerage accounts. In addition, defendants allegedly misrepresented the amount of investor funds they raised from investors by falsely telling investors that their money would be used for legitimate business purposes, when in fact the money was actually used to pay for personal expenses for Cohen's wife and two other companies.Â   The SEC alleges in its complaint that Cohen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Cohen consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $25,000, for a total of over $1.2 million, which will be deemed satisfied by the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations by Cohen and a cease-and-desist order for which Cohen agreed to be enjoined from participating in any offering or sales of any security, investment, municipal bond, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization (registration required).  In a parallel action, on December 5, 2016, in federal district court in Manhattan, Judge James B.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19802 / August 11, 2006    SEC v. U.S. Wind Farming, Inc., William L. Telander, et al., Case No. 05 C 4259 (N. D. Ill, filed July 25, 2005)    On August 9, 2006, the Commission filed an amended complaint in this matter alleging that Defendant Raymond J. McNamee of Newport Beach, California violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission alleged in its initial complaint that McNamee violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and obtained a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against him and other defendants. In addition to alleging the registration violations against McNamee, the amended complaint alleges that he played a much greater role in the U.S. Wind Farming fraudulent scheme. Pursuant to McNamee's instructions, another defendant, William Telander, created U.S. Wind Farming via a series of transactions involving a corporate shell with publicly traded shares. McNamee obtained 25.1 million unregistered U.S. Wind Farming shares from Telander without paying for these shares. McNamee and Telander then drafted and issued fraudulent press releases to hype the market and bolster the prices at which McNamee and other defendants could sell their unregistered U.S. Wind Farming shares. In total, McNamee sold over 17 million U.S. Wind Farming shares for over $400,000, at prices inflated by his fraudulent conduct.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20080 / August 8, 2006  Securities and Exchange Commission v. William L. Telander, et al., Civ. Action 1:05-CV-4259 (N.D. Pa.)  SEC Charges Three Former Executives of Wind Farming, Inc. with Fraud   The United States Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the Northern District of Illinois against three former executives of wind farm cooperatives:  Raymond J. McNamee, age 56, of Dana Point, California, and Anthony M. Necoechea of Newport Beach, Calif.  According to the Commission's complaint, from April 2004 through March of 2005, the former president and chief executive officer of the company engaged in a scheme to evade the registration provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to sell unregistered securities to investors who acted as purported Pennsylvania accredited investors. The complaint alleges that the defendants created artificial demand through the issuance of false and misleading press releases and through false statements posted on the Wind Farm's website. In early 2004, as part of their scheme, Mcnamee assisted Telands in forming a corporate shell with publicly traded shares. Shortly after receiving his shares, in coordination with his sales of these shares and knowing that he was selling them into the public market at artificially inflated prices, he and his entities sold their shares to public investors without registering the offerings with the SEC. To facilitate the illegal sale of those shares by the two defendants, they created an artificial supply and demand for the securities. They then sold the stock to unsuspecting investors, creating the impression that they were purchasing the shares for a legitimate business purpose. As a result of this conduct, at least three individuals and three entities they controlled, received wind Farming shares as payment for legal services and sold them for profits of approximately $430,000, or $1.2 million in net revenue for each share. This conduct violated the antifraud and securities registration requirements of Sections 5, 6, 13, 17, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 38, 41, 43, 42, 45, 52, 47,
