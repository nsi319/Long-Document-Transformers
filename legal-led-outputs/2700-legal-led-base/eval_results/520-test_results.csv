Lowrance and First Capital Savings & Loan, Ltd., Case No.: 09-CV-1179 (N.D. Cal. filed June 28, 2010)  SEC OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF TO HALT ONGOING FRAUDULENT TRADING SCHEME   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a New Zealand-based investment company and its founder and chief executive officer, who conducted a fraudulent foreign currency trading scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal district court in San Jose, New York, Jeffrey A.-Lowrance, a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota, founded and controls First Cap Savings and Loan and since its inception in 2007 raised approximately $21 million from approximately thirty-six investors. The SEC alleges that, from at least April 2007 through February 2009, the defendants defrauded investors by promising high fixed rates of return from foreign currencies trading. In reality, they sought the investors' trust by pretending to share their values and aspirations, spending millions of dollars in investor funds to pay for their own personal expenses and to fund their start-up newspaper, USA Tomorrow, which carried articles and advertisements promoting a limited government ideology. As alleged in the complaint, First CAP was not profitable at all and never had any profitable business operations. Instead, after transferring investor money to an off-shore brokerage account, and encouraging investors to tout the success of the trading program to their friends and colleagues, The Honorable Robert S. Leach, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) ofthe Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5, 5(c), and 15(e) by the Commission and Sections 9(1), (2)(A), 13(B), 16(d)(C), 15 (d), 17 (a) (filed Sep. 29, 2008), et al., and Rules 9a-1, 13b2-2","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 22040 / July 15, 2011  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jeffery A. Lowrance, et al., Case No. CV-11-3451  SEC CHARGES OPERATOR OF $21 MILLION FOREX PONZI SCHEME   The Securities and Exchange Commission on July 14, 2011 filed fraud charges against the CEO of a purported foreign currency trading firm, alleging he scammed hundreds of investors with false promises of high, fixed-rate returns while secretly using their money to fund his start-up alternative newspaper.  First Capital Savings &amp; Loan Ltd. Chief Executive Jeffery A. Lowrance, who had fled to Peru and was arrested there earlier this year, was arraigned today on criminal fraud charges in a 2010 indictment filed by the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois. In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed fraud charges Thursday against Lowrance and First Capital.  The SEC alleges that Lowrance raised approximately $21 million from investors in at least 26 states, including California, Oregon, Illinois and Utah by promising huge profits from a specialized foreign currency trading program.  In reality, First Capital conducted little foreign currency trading, lost money on the little trading that it conducted, and never engaged in any profitable business operations.  Lowrance targeted investors by purporting to share their Christian values and limited-government political views.  He solicited investors through, among other things, ads in his start-up newspaper USA Tomorrow, which he distributed at a September 2, 2008 political rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota.    According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, California, Lowrance and First Capital promised investors a &#8220;predictable monthly income,&#8221; with monthly returns up to 7.15 percent through foreign currency trading.  Some investors were told their investment was guaranteed, and were given bogus letters of credit.  First Capital also published a spreadsheet purporting to show its multi-year history of profitable trades.  In fact, the trades were fictitious.  Instead of engaging in foreign currency trading as claimed, Lowrance and First Capital secretly diverted investor funds to pay fake returns to other, earlier investors, to pay Lowrance (despite his failure to earn a profit for the investors), and to fund his newspaper.  Lowrance&#8217;s scheme began to unravel in June 2008 and Lowrance and First Capital had lost all of the investors&#8217; money by September 2008.  Nevertheless, Lowrance solicited at least an additional $1 million from at least 36 investors between June 2008 and February 2009 by continuing to tout First Capital&#8217;s fictitious high returns, the SEC alleges.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges Lowrance and First Capital violated Sections Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks disgorgement, penalties, and other relief.

Joshua Constantin, Brian Solomon, and Windham Securities, Inc., 11 CV ECFCASE (SDNY)  SEC Charges Defendants in $1.25 Million Fraudulent Investment Scheme  On September 29, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, from at least May 2008 to March 2009, Defendants engaged in a fraudulent investment scheme that obtained more than half a million dollars from seven investors.  The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced investors to open brokerage accounts and make securities investments that were purportedly for a private company, Leeward Group, which the Defendants claimed would soon become a publicly traded company. The complaint further alleges the scheme included a wide range of outlandish misrepresentations and omissions about the use of the investors' funds. According to the complaint, defendants falsely claimed that they were purchasing securities for their own use, when in fact they misappropriated almost all of those funds and used the funds to purchase securities in an entity they controlled and in which they did not hold any ownership interest. In fact, as the Complaint alleges, they had no right to do so and were instead using the money to pay their personal and business expenses and to make payments to other investors, in violation of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. Additionally, according to a complaint filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Constantin and Solomon perpetrated and concealed their fraud by fabricating and issuing to certain investors phony promissory notes and other fraudulent account statements that falsely showed that their investments had been purchased by a company they claimed was soon to be a public company with the assistance of a registered broker-dealer. To further their fraudulent tactics, Victor Victor, a Los Angeles-based registered representative, provided the investor with a list of purported investment opportunities from which he and Victor made false statements. Victor also used investor funds for his own personal use and for personal expenses, including paying a $450,000 kickback to Victor and his wife, Sofia, who were also registered representatives at the brokerage firm Victor.Victor Victor is also charged with aiding and abetting the fraudulent conduct alleged by the SEC. He has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 22030 / July 7, 2011  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Action No. 11-CV-4642 (filed July 6, 2011)  SEC CHARGES NEW YORK BROKERAGE FIRM AND TWO EXECUTIVES WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS IN PRIVATE PLACEMENT  The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged a New York-based brokerage firm and two executives with misappropriating investor funds.  The SEC alleges that Windham Securities, Inc., Windham&#8217;s owner and principal Joshua Constantin, and former Windham managing director Brian Solomon fraudulently induced investors to provide more than $1.25 million to Windham for securities investments and fees by making false claims concerning the intended use of investor funds as well as Windham&#8217;s investment expertise and historical returns. Instead of purchasing securities for investors as represented, the defendants misappropriated the investors&#8217; funds and then provided false assurances to investors to cover up their fraud.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Windham, Constantin, and Solomon misappropriated investor funds from an investment opportunity they had recommended to investors in Leeward Group, Inc., then a private company they told investors Windham was helping to take public. Constantin and Solomon raised more than $1.1 million for investments in Leeward and collected an additional $135,000 in fees purportedly for access to Windham investment opportunities or other related investment services. Constantin then transferred approximately $668,000 of the funds raised from investors to his personal bank account and to the account of Constantin Resource Group, Inc. (CRG), an entity he owned and controlled. Constantin used these funds to pay his personal and business expenses and to pay Solomon, among other things. Constantin also transferred $450,000 of investor funds to purchase Leeward securities in the name of Domestic Applications Corp. (DAC), an entity he controlled and in which none of the investors held any ownership interest. Constantin and Solomon then attempted to conceal their fraud and falsely reassure investors by fabricating phony promissory notes and Windham account statements that falsely showed that the investors had purchased Leeward securities.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Windham, Constantin, and Solomon with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Constantin with liability as a control person for Windham&#8217;s Exchange Act violations and as an aider and abettor of Windham&#8217;s and Solomon&#8217;s Exchange Act violations. In its complaint, the SEC also names CRG and DAC as relief defendants. The SEC&#8217;s complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and penalties against Windham, Constantin, and Solomon, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest against CRG and DAC as relief defendants.

2,"On February 8, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Todd M. LaVelle with insider trading in advance of the February 20, 2014 announcement that Brookdale Senior Living Inc. would acquire Emeritus Corporation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that, beginning in or about September 2013, a senior officer of a medical products distributor engaged in highly confidential merger negotiations with a company owned by In Home Medical Solutions, LLC, and received confidential information about the impending merger. Because the potential merger potentially had significant business implications for In-Home Medical, its largest customer was going to receive more medical supplies from the merger, according to the complaint. The complaint further alleges La Velle misappropriated the information and converted it to his personal use and profit, realizing a profit of approximately $25,342. Without admitting or denying the allegations, La Vele has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038 and a civil penalty equal to $50,000; and imposing a penny-stock bar against him for a period of five years. In a parallel action, on February 7, 2019, United States District Judge Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar in a related criminal case filed by the SEC on March 5, 2020. On February 21, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and cooperated fully with the Commission's investigation, which is continuing. He has been sentenced to 20 months in prison and will be supervised by Antonia Chion, Yuri B. Zelinsky, Greg Hillson and Jason Litow, all from Miami, Florida.Â  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter.","Feb. 12, 2018 - Two former executives of a medical products distributor have agreed to settle charges that they illegally traded on inside information in the securities of Emeritus Corp.  According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Todd M. LaVelle, the former chief executive officer and a board member of In Home Medical Solutions, LLC (IHMS) and Ara Chackerian, a former officer and board member of IHMS, both learned of an impending merger between Emeritus and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. from IHMS' Chief Operating Officer. The merger potentially had significant business implications for IHMS because a subsidiary of Emeritus was IHMS' largest customer. Before the merger was publicly announced, LaVelle and Chackerian bought Emeritus securities and each sold them for illegal profits of over $25,000 and $157,000, respectively, the day after the merger announcement.  The SEC's complaint against LaVelle, filed on February 8, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, LaVelle agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $25,342.40 in disgorgement, $2,629.81 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,342.40. The settlement is pending court approval.  The SEC's order against Chackerian finds that he violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Chackerian consented to a cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $157,207.80, prejudgment interest of $18,635.55, and a civil penalty of $157,207.80.

Bradley, Ronald C Brewer, and Alexanderia K. Blankenship, United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Case 4:08-cv-02351  SEC CHARGES FORMER ATTORNEY AND LAW ENFORCER IN $3.9 MILLION INSIDER TRADING SCHEME  The Securities &amp;Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United State Court in Houston, Texas against former Texas attorney and convicted felon Robert ""Buddy"" Bradley and his son Donald Bradley. The Commission's complaint alleges that, in June 2005, Bradley was to orchestrate a reverse merger between Exobox Technologies Corporation and a privately held Delaware corporation known as Kilis, Inc., and that he and the Bradley brothers, Marc and Jeffrey Bradley of Las Vegas, Nevada and Roger Brewer of Penzance, England, engineered the fraudulent distribution of over 10 million shares of the common stock of a publicly-held company.  According to the complaint, from approximately late 2005 through at least April 2007, the Bradleys, through the use of offshore entities controlled by Landess and Brewer and their son-in-law, arranged to transfer and sell the vast majority of those shares into the public market through ""grey market"" sales, reaping collective proceeds of $1.91 million. During the period in which Son field marshaled the shares, backdated certificates were issued to incorrectly reflect that they could be traded under exemptions to registration provisions of federal securities laws. In order to facilitate the transfer of these shares and facilitate prompt re-sale of them, they consented to a court order requiring them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by either the SEC or the NASD. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, each defendant has agreed to settle the charges against him or her by consenting to an order permanently enjoining him from violating the registration, antifraud, reporting and disclosure requirements of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20665 / July 31, 2008  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Texas, Houston Division) (July 29, 2008)  SEC Action Alleges Registration and Anti-Fraud Violations by Six Individudals  On July 29, 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging that six individuals, including a Houston, Texas attorney and a Las Vegas, Nevada attorney, violated various provisions of the federal securities laws in their unregistered, nonexempt distribution of more than 10.8 million shares of the common stock of a Houston, Texas software development company. The complaint further alleges that the six individuals, and one relief defendant, collectively reaped proceeds exceeding $3.91 million from their illegal scheme.  Named in the Commission's complaint are:   Robert L. Sonfield, 76, a Houston, Texas, attorney; Donald C. Bradley, 76, of Las Vegas, Nevada; Jeffrey W. Bradley, 48, of Las Vegas, Nevada; Jason Landess, 62, a Las Vegas, Nevada, attorney; Marc Lane, 46, believed to reside in Cadiz, Spain; Roger Brewer, 52, believed to reside in Penzance, England; and, Alexanderia Blankenship, 46, of Houston, Texas (named as a relief defendant only, for purposes of securing a return of stock sales proceeds transferred to her).   The Commission's complaint alleges that in the summer of 2005, Landess, Don Bradley and Don Bradley's son Jeffrey Bradley conveyed control of a Nevada corporate shell to Sonfield. The complaint further alleges that Sonfield caused the shell to issue several unpaid, backdated stock certificates, in order to make false claims that the shares qualified for sale under certain exemptions to the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  In September 2005, according to the complaint, Sonfield, Lane and Brewer merged the shell with a privately held corporation engaged in the development of computer security software. Following the merger, Sonfield, Lane and Brewer controlled virtually all of the supposed ""free trading,"" public ""float"" of the common stock of the surviving software corporation, Exobox Technologies Corp., which is based in Houston, Texas. From approximately late 2005 through at least April 2007, according to the complaint, Sonfield, Lane, Brewer, Landess, Jeff Bradley and Don Bradley transferred and sold the vast majority of the shares into the public market through over the counter sales for collective proceeds of $3.91 million. Of those total proceeds, the complaint further alleges that relief defendant Blankenship received $600,000, as the result of her personal relationship with Sonfield.  The complaint also alleges that Sonfield prepared various filings with the Commission for Exobox, which omitted the material fact that he, Lane and Brewer controlled almost all of Exobox's public float. The complaint alleges that because of these material omissions, Sonfield (but not Exobox or its officers and directors) violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that all the defendants (except the relief defendant)violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, that Sonfield also violated Sections 10(b) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 thereunder and that he aided and abetted violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and that Lane and Brewer also violated Section 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking injunctive relief against future violations of these provisions by the respective defendants, civil money penalties, penny stock bars, and disgorgement with pre-judgment interest of any ill-gotten gains. The Commission further seeks an order requiring that relief defendant Blankenship disgorge any ill-gotten proceeds she received.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, from at least 1997 through the present, the hedge funds have operated a fraudulent scheme that has defrauded investors out of more than $1.2 million. According to the complaint, this scheme was orchestrated by a group of individuals and entities that claimed to be in charge of managing the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Economic and Risk Analysis and Management, and that the defendants were members of that group, including Julian Financial Group, Vl. David Taraslav TatartaKovskiy, Michael Yeninas and Michael Green, all of whom are residents of Houston, Texas and are associated with J.BS Investments, Inc., a now-defunct investment adviser based in Houston. In addition, as a result of their conduct, Ards of America, LLC, a registered broker-dealer, has agreed to pay $2.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, for a total of approximately $3.8 million, which will be distributed to investors who are not registered with the SEC. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Julian has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay a penalty of $500,000, plus a $50,500 penalty. Yeni has also agreed not to participate in any offering of any penny stock and will not be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Additionally, by consenting to entry of an order requiring him, he has to provide a sworn sworn statement of his financial condition and provide an accounting for his and his companies' compliance with certain undertakings under Section 17(a) and (c) the Securities Act and SectionÂ 3(d) (a).

Ardian Finance Group et al.  C.A. No. CV 02 4386 (E.D.N.Y.) The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency injunctive action today in the United States Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that Ardian Finance Group (&quot;Ardian&quot;) conducted a fraudulent unregistered offering that raised over $1.2 million from at least 70 investors. Vladislav Tartakovsky, the President of Ardian, orchestrated this fraudulent offering, and he retained Michael Yeninas and Michael Green to solicit investors to purchase Ardian securities.  Ardian, Tartakovsky, Yeninas and Green all made material misrepresentations to investors to induce them to purchase Ardian securities.  The Commission's complaint names the following defendants:   Ardian, a Delaware corporation, which has its principal place of business in Long Island City, New York.  Ardian is purportedly in the business of providing short-term financing, including factoring and check-cashing services for small businesses.  Tartakovsky, age 31, a resident of Fair Lawn, New Jersey.  Tartakovsky is the President of Ardian.  Yeninas, age 28, a resident of Queens, New York.  Green, age and residence unknown, who is purportedly a &quot;Senior Financial Consultant&quot; to Ardian.   Specifically, the Complaint alleges the following:  From approximately October 2001 through the present, Tartakovsky orchestrated a fraudulent unregistered offering of Ardian securities through which Ardian raised approximately $1.2 million from at least 70 investors.   To facilitate this Offering, Ardian and Tartakovsky retained Yeninas and Green and other salespersons to offer and sell Ardian securities to investors.  In connection with its Offering, Ardian provided private offering memoranda (&quot;POM&quot;), which Tartakovsky helped prepare, to investors.  The POM contained material misrepresentations.  For instance, Ardian claimed that it had a &quot;matching fund commitment by an unrelated third party financing institution&quot; to provide funds to finance Ardian's operations.   This representation was false.  Ardian had no such agreement.  In its POM, Ardian also claimed that William Marconi (&quot;Marconi&quot;) and Michael Rehzets (&quot;Rehzets&quot;) were currently serving as officers and/or directors of Ardian.  This representation too was false.  To date, neither Rehzets nor Marconi has performed any functions for Ardian.  In connection with their efforts to solicit investors, Yeninas and Green also concocted a variety of purported facts to persuade investors to purchase Ardian securities.  Among other things, Yeninas and Green told investors that (i) Ardian was planning an initial public offering (&quot;IPO&quot;) on a date certain (i.e. July 2002), and (ii) investors could sell their stock the first day Ardian stock was publicly traded at a specific price (i.e. $5-7 per share), which was a significant premium over the $2.00 to $2.50 per share that the investor was paying to purchase the stock in the Offering.  These representations were false.  In fact, Ardian had not taken any steps to conduct an IPO. Additionally, Yeninas told investors that Ardian was financing companies involved in the Ground Zero clean-up following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  This representation was false.  Ardian provided no such financing.  The Commission alleges that through this conduct, Ardian, Tartakovsky, Yeninas and Green violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Additionally, Green violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  In addition to expedited relief, including a temporary restraining order, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest against all of the defendants.  The Commission is also seeking civil penalties against Tartakovsky, Yeninas and Green.  Additionally, the Complaint names JBS Investments, Inc., a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in Brooklyn, New York, as a relief defendant.

With Fraudulent Stock Option Backdating Scheme  The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the U.N.C. against two former officers and a former General Counsel of the Company, alleging that they engaged in a fraudulent scheme to grant undisclosed, in-the-money stock options to themselves and others, by backdating stock option grants from 1991 through 2001 to coincide with historically low closing prices for CTI's stock.  According to the Commission's complaint, these executives were able to conceal from investors that the company was not recording material compensation expenses and was materially overstating its net income and earnings per share by the exercise of illegally backdated options. These executives collectively realized millions of dollars in illicit compensation through their participation in this scheme. The Commission alleges that, beginning in 1999, the defendants looked back and picked a grant date that coincided with dates of low annual and quarterly closing price for Connecticut's common stock and used that date to select an exercise date with the benefit of hindsight based on the options that had been granted under that grant. Alexander also allegedly altered the list of grantees submitted to his compensation committee by removing line items identifying the slush fund. In reality, no corporate action took place on this date selected by these defendants.&nbsp;  Beginning in 2000, Alexander allegedly created and controlled a pool of ""guaranteed"" options for which Alexander was responsible for selecting the award date. He allegedly used the names of fictitious employees among the name of real employees on CT's grant list for option awards. They proposed option award awards small enough so as not to draw the attention of CTi's compensation Committee at the time the Compensation Committee approved the option. Also, on at least one occasion, Kreinsberg altered company records to show that he had signed the grant dates on his behalf.

Sorin, Comverse&#8217;s former General and Senior General Counsel, and a former Comverse director, alleging that they engaged in a decade-long fraudulent scheme to grant undisclosed, in-the-money options to themselves and to others by backdating stock option grants to coincide with historically low closing prices of Comverse common stock.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Alexander and Kreinberg created a slush fund of backdated options by causing options to be granted to fictitious employees and, later, used these options, some of which were made immediately exercisable, to recruit and retain key personnel.  The Complaint alleges that as part of the scheme, the former executives made material misrepresentations to Comverse investors regarding Comverse&#8217;s stock option grants and concealed from investors that Comverse had not recorded compensation expenses for option grants.  As a result, Comverse materially overstated its net income and earnings per share between 1991 and at least 2002.      According to the Complaint, the former executives collectively realized millions of dollars of ill-gotten compensation through the exercise of illegally backdated option grants and the subsequent sale of Comverse common stock.  The complaint alleges, among other things, that:  Comverse is a maker of software, systems, and related services for multimedia communication and information processing applications headquartered in New York, New York.  Beginning in 1991, Alexander, 54, of New York, New York, repeatedly used hindsight to select a date when the closing price of Comverse&#8217;s common stock was at or near a quarterly or annual low.  Alexander later communicated this date and closing price to Sorin, 56, of New York, New York, in order for it to be used as the date of, and exercise price for, a grant of Comverse options.  Sorin, with Alexander&#8217;s knowledge, then created company records that falsely indicated that a committee of Comverse&#8217;s board of directors had actually approved the option grant on the date Alexander had &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; when, in fact, the committee acted to make the grant on a different, and later, date.  Kreinberg, 41, of Teaneck, New Jersey, joined the scheme no later than 1998, and assisted Alexander in using hindsight to select a backdated grant date.  Kreinberg knew that company records reflected false grant dates.     Alexander and Kreinberg also created a slush fund of backdated Comverse options between 1999 and 2002 by, among other things, secretly inserting fictitious names among the names of actual Comverse employees on proposed option grantee lists which then were submitted to a committee of Comverse&#8217;s board of directors for approval.  Once the committee approved these options, Alexander, with Kreinberg&#8217;s knowledge, used the slush fund&#8217;s backdated options to recruit and retain key personnel until at least 2002.    Kreinberg instructed a Comverse employee to conceal the existence of the slush fund from Comverse&#8217;s auditors and in March 2006, after learning that a special committee of Comverse&#8217;s board would investigate the company&#8217;s option grants, Kreinberg undertook to hide the existence of the slush fund by altering records in Comverse&#8217;s electronic option-tracking system.  Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin also made misrepresentations to Comverse&#8217;s auditors in order to conceal the backdating scheme.  As a result of the scheme, Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin received undisclosed, in-the-money options which had an immediate intrinsic gain because the exercise price of the option was lower than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.  Alexander realized actual gains of nearly $138 million from sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options that were granted during the 1991 to 2001 period.  At least $6.4 million of this gain represents the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Alexander.  Kreinberg realized an actual gain of nearly $13 million from the sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options granted during the 1994 to 2001 period, with at least $1 million of this gain representing the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Kreinberg.  Sorin realized an actual gain of more than $14 million from the sales of stock underlying the exercises of backdated options granted during the 1991 to 2001 period, with approximately $1 million of this gain representing the in-the-money portion of the options at the time of the grant to Sorin.  From fiscal year 2001 to 2002, Kreinberg, with Sorin&#8217;s knowledge, initiated a similar backdating scheme at Ulticom, Inc., a publicly-traded, majority-owned subsidiary of Comverse.    Comverse and Ulticom have publicly announced that they expect to restate their historical financial results for multiple years in order to record additional, material non-cash charges for option-related compensation expenses.    The Complaint charges the defendants with fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws, including the books and records, internal controls, lying to auditors and, as to Alexander and Kreinberg, the Sarbanes-Oxley certification provisions.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, officer and director bars, disgorgement  with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The Commission&#8217;s investigation in this matter is continuing.

SEC CHARGES ENDOCARE, INC., KEVIN M. QUILTY, AND JERRY W. ANDERSON WITH FINANCIAL FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against Endocare, Inc., a medical device company based in Irvine, California, and its former senior vice president of sales and marketing, Kevin M., for their roles in a financial fraud perpetrated on the investing public.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California:  Beginning in 2001 and continuing through the present, the company made numerous false and misleading disclosures in its Forms 8-K and press releases, including false statements regarding revenue recognition, improper accounting for sales of products and services, improperly understated or delayed the recognition of expenses to inflate earnings.&nbsp;  Anderson, age 59, is a resident of Gunter, Texas. Anderson was the president and chief executive officer of Endoare. The Commission alleges that Anderson and Quilty violated the antifraud, reporting, books-and-records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted violations of Sections 5(a)(1) and (3), and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and the reporting and record-keeping provisions, as well as the internal control provisions. In addition to its financial reporting obligations, Anderson is alleged to have violated Section 13(j) of Securities Act Section 15(e) in connection with the filing of false financial statements and other material information with Endomare in 2002 and 2003. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Commission action, both Anderson has consented to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions and to pay disgorgement of $1,450,000, plus prejudgment interest and a one-time civil penalty totaling $7,500, which will be deemed satisfied by the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Anderson from future violations and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties and pay a","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19772 / July 25, 2006  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2464 / July 25, 2006  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Endocare, Inc., Kevin M. Quilty, and Jerry W. Anderson, Civil Action No. CV 06-4502 RSWL (SSx)(C.D.Cal.).  SEC Charges Endocare With Accounting Fraud and Misleading Statements About Internal Investigation  Endocare Agrees to Pay $750,000 Penalty; Three Senior Officials Also Agree to Settlements    The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced on July 19, 2006 that Irvine, California-based Endocare, Inc. agreed to settle fraud charges for engaging in a widespread accounting fraud and then making false and misleading public statements about the results of an internal investigation. At the time, Endocare developed and distributed medical devices for use in the treatment of various types of cancers and urological ailments.   To settle the Commission's charges, which were filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California, Endocare agreed to pay a $750,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from the antifraud, reporting, recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Endocare agreed to settle the Commission's action without admitting or denying the allegations.   The Commission also announced that Endocare's senior vice president of sales, Kevin Quilty (Quilty), age 52, of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and the former president of an Endocare subsidiary, Jerry W. Anderson (Anderson), age 59, of Gunter, Texas, agreed to settle Commission charges for recordkeeping and internal controls violations and (in the case of Quilty) for aiding and abetting Endocare's reporting violations. Quilty agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay $23,749 in disgorgement and interest, and a $25,000 penalty. Anderson agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a $35,000 penalty. In a separate administrative proceeding instituted by the Commission on July 19, Endocare's former director of sales for the Southeast region, L. Michael Hart, age 58, of Fort Pierce, Florida, agreed to cease and desist from causing Endocare's reporting and recordkeeping violations. All agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations and findings. The settlements are subject to approval by the court.   According to the Commission's complaint, Endocare engaged in improper revenue recognition practices, ranging from false sales to undisclosed side agreements, and improperly understated or deferred expenses to inflate earnings. As alleged in the complaint, Endocare reported a consistent history of ""record revenue"" growth quarter over quarter, reporting $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2001 to $11.4 million for the second quarter of 2002. The complaint alleges that, as a result of its fraudulent accounting, Endocare overstated revenue by at least 33% for the second quarter of 2002. The complaint further alleges that Endocare understated its pre-tax loss for 2001 by 20% and falsely reported pre-tax earnings for the first two quarters of 2002, rather than its actual substantial losses.   The complaint further alleges that Quilty and Anderson assisted in Endocare's improper revenue practices. The complaint alleges that Quilty entered into numerous undisclosed side agreements containing contingent terms and parked product shipped to Endocare-controlled warehouses. The complaint also alleges that Anderson created fictitious customers used to purchase $1.2 million in product in September 2002.   Also according to the complaint, Endocare committed additional securities law violations in the course of investigating allegations of improper accounting raised by its acting controller. In late October 2002, after receiving the controller's allegations, Endocare's audit committee retained a law firm to perform an investigation. Endocare's auditors at the time, KPMG, suggested that the audit committee hire independent counsel and an independent forensic accountant to conduct the investigation. In November 2002, after reviewing the work of a forensic accountant that the audit committee had retained, KPMG informed the audit committee that it was not prepared to complete its quarterly review until an expanded internal investigation had been performed. In December 2002, KPMG informed the audit committee that it had concluded that it could no longer rely on the representations of Endocare's management, and that it was withdrawing its report on Endocare's financial statements for the last fiscal year. Following these events, however, in March 2003 Endocare issued a press release in which it announced that, after an ""independent review and investigation,"" the audit committee and its advisors had concluded that there was ""no indication of fraud or intentional wrongdoing by management."" The complaint alleges that this press release was false and misleading because, first, Endocare in fact had not conducted an independent investigation, and second, its internal review had in fact revealed substantial evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing.   In its complaint, the Commission charged Endocare with violating the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act); the reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; recordkeeping provision, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act; and internal controls provision, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The Commission further charged Quilty and Anderson with aiding and abetting and violating the recordkeeping provisions, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and additionally as to Quilty, aiding and abetting Endocare's violations of reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.   The settled administrative proceeding against Hart finds that he executed side agreements containing contingent terms, in violation of above-described reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws.

Nielsen for his role in a fraudulent scheme to pump and dump the stock of Arrayit Corporation, a biotechnology company.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least March 2, 2020 through April 13, 2019, Nielsen posted numerous false and misleading statements on an internet forum that were designed to encourage other investors to buy the company's stock. The complaint alleges that Nielsen used a deceptive technique, known as ""spoofing,"" in which he placed &#8220; and subsequently cancelled&#8221; large orders to give the false appearance of a high demand for the security. In addition, Nielse n allegedly used several types of false statements to ""pump upâ the stocks, including: (1) statements that ArrayIT developed a COVID-19 test, (2), and (3) claims that he purchased, or intended to purchase, large amounts of arrayit stock; (4) misrepresentations of the value of his holdings, such as that his shares were ""inflated,"" when he actually owned a substantial financial interest in the securities and, despite his public promotion, did not intend to dump them.&nbsp;  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Northern District of California today filed criminal charges charging Nielsen with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 6(c) and 17(e) the federal securities laws.

According to the SEC's complaint, from December 2014 to December 2017, a long-time radio personality in Dallas/Fort Worth who markets himself as ""The Money Doctor,"" raised approximately $20,000 from investors by offering and selling securities through two North Texas-based companies he owns and controls: GFG and the Gallagher Agency. Despite having no valid securities-industry credentials, Gallagher has offered and sold securities, raising over $18 million since December 2016. The SEC alleges that Gallagher has used the money to pay for his personal expenses, including a car, home, and business expenses. Gallagher also allegedly used investor funds to purchase a home in Texas for himself and his family, which he used to support his lifestyle and to fund his gambling and gambling habit. In a parallel action the U.S. Attorney's Office for Texas announced criminal charges against Gallagher. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and in a related criminal proceeding, Galagher and Gallagher agreed to settle the charges and pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $10,722.84, together with a total penalty of nearly $13 million in civil penalties.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.

The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, penny stock bars and officer-and-director bars against all defendants, as well as an order barring Gallagher from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has charged Texas resident William Neil ""Doc"" Gallagher-the self-styled ""Money Doctor"" featured on three Dallas-area radio stations-in an emergency action to shut down a $19.6 million Ponzi scheme targeting elderly investors' retirement funds.  The SEC also charged Gallagher Financial Group, Inc. and W. Neil Gallagher, Ph.D. Agency, Inc., companies that Gallagher used to carry out the scheme.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed under seal on March 7, 2019, alleged that Gallagher made frequent religious references on his radio shows to establish his standing among a target audience of retired Christian investors.  From December 2014 through January 2019, he raised at least $19.6 million from approximately 60 senior citizens.  Falsely claiming to be a licensed investment adviser, he offered an investment that he called a Diversified Growth and Income Strategy Account, in which he promised to acquire income-generating assets for his clients in five specified categories.  He promised investors that they would receive guaranteed, risk-free returns in their accounts ranging from 5% to 8% per year.  In reality, except for one $75,000 annuity purchase, Gallagher purchased no assets in any of the five categories and no other assets to back the promised returns.  Instead, he exhausted virtually all investor funds on spending unrelated to the accounts, including misappropriating significant portions for personal and company expenses and to make Ponzi payments to investors.  To lull investors and conceal the scheme, Gallagher provided investors phony account statements showing false account balances.  The SEC alleges that Gallagher and his companies violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC is seeking preliminary, permanent, and conduct-based injunctions as well as disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  In a related case, the Dallas County District Attorney's Office obtained an indictment against Gallagher on March 4, 2019, for securities-fraud and other criminal charges stemming from the scheme.  On March 8, 2019, Gallagher was arrested on those charges, which remain pending.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Melanie K. Good, John J. Devine, and Melvin E.

Galleon Management, L.P., Civil Action No. 1:05CV1006 (RMU)(D.D.C.)(May 19, 2005)  GALLEON MANAGEMENT, L.P., CONSENTS TO PAY A $870,247 CIVIL PENALTY RELATING TO SHORT SELLING IN CONNECTION WITH 17 FOLLOW-ON OFFERINGS  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a civil penalty action against Galleon Management, L.P. a New York-based hedge fund adviser.  The Commission's Complaint alleges that in connection with 17 follow-on offerings from 2000 through 2003, Galleon violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, which prohibits covering a short sale with securities obtained in a public offering if the short sale occurred beginning five business days before the pricing of the offering.  These violations occurred in seven of Galleon's funds with the majority occurring in the Admiral's Overseas fund.   According to the Commission's Complaint, Galleon routinely created follow-on offering boxed positions by establishing a long position with shares purchased in an offering while simultaneously maintaining a pre-pricing short position in the securities of the same issuer.  In some instances, Galleon instructed its prime broker to flatten these boxed positions through the use of riskless, offsetting journal entries, a practice known as ""collapsing the box.""  On other occasions, Galleon unwound its boxed positions by contemporaneously entering a market order to sell the offering shares and another order to purchase an equivalent number of shares, which were then used to cover the short position that had been established during the Rule 105 restricted period.  These unwinding transactions were entered through two different brokers and executed in the open market.  The Complaint further alleges that Galleon realized profits of $1,040,882 from these transactions.  Galleon, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, has consented to pay a civil penalty of $870,247.   On May 19, 2005, the Commission also instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative cease-and-desist proceeding against Galleon based on the same conduct.  (In the Matter of Galleon Management, L.P., Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-11928) (""Order""). Galleon agreed to settle the proceeding, without admitting or denying the findings in the Order.  Galleon consented to (1) cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M, (2) disgorge $1,040,882 in profits and pay prejudgment interest of $109,321, and (3) adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of Regulation M of the federal securities laws, review those policies and procedures annually, and designate an employee as a chief compliance officer for these purposes.

Usee, Inc., et al., Civil Action Number 3:12-cv-01325 (United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division)  SEC Files Fraud Charges Against Texas-Based Tele-Media Company and Two Brokers for Their Scheme to Promote Massive Returns to Investors  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (Commission) announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States federal court in Dallas, Texas against Texas resident Scott A. Wiese and his brother, Terry Wiee, for their roles in a fraudulent offering of unregistered securities and short-term, high-yield promissory notes issued by their company, Unitedsee Inc. (Usee). The Commission's complaint alleges that between December 2009 and September 2010, the brothers raised almost $6 million from nearly 80 investors through fraudulent offerings of securities. The defendants told investors that their funds would be used to purchase a California-based VoIP service provider and its valuable patent portfolio. They also promised that investors would receive returns of up to 100% in 60 to 90 days.  In reality, according to the complaint, all but two investors lost the money they invested with the defendants. In addition, none of the investors who did receive partial payments were repaid with money raised from other investors. Finally, investors were not told about the diversion of funds by the Defendants, and they are not charged with any violations of Section 17(a) the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, as well as an accounting and officer and director bar against them and an order barring them from serving as officers or directors of any public company for a period of five years. Both defendants agreed to pay a total of $1.5 million in restitution to investors in connection with their fraudulent scheme. According to SEC filings, filed in federal district court, from December 2010 through December 2011, Scott and Terry raised at least $5.4 million through the sale of stock in an entity they formed, USee, which purported to","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22348 / April 30, 2012  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Usee, Inc., et al, Case No. 3:12-cv-01325-M (N.D.Tex.) (filed April 30, 2012)  SEC CHARGES VOIP COMPANY AND ITS OWNERS WITH CONDUCTING A FRAUDULENT OFFERING TARGETING CHRISTIAN INVESTORS  On April 30, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled fraud charges against the owners of a Dallas-area Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) company, for running a fraudulent securities offering aimed at Christian investors, many of whom were affiliated with a Dallas-based private school. The Commission&rsquo;s complaint, filed in Dallas federal court, alleges that Terry E. Wiese and Scott A. Wiese promised extreme returns &ndash; as much as 1,000% in a year &ndash; to entice investment in their company, Usee, Inc. Contrary to the Wieses&rsquo; claims, however, Usee had no business from which to generate any returns to investors. Instead, the Commission alleges that the Wieses wasted investor funds on poorly considered ventures or sent them to third parties about which they had little information. The Commission also alleges that the Wieses used investor funds for personal expenses and to make Ponzi payments to investors.   According to the complaint, the Wieses and Usee offered two forms of investment: stock and promissory notes. The Wieses promised returns to stock investors of up to 1,000% in the first year. Note investors were promised returns of up to 100% in 60 days. The Wieses also claimed that Usee would earn $26 billion in revenue by its fifth year of business, due to lucrative financing agreements it had arranged. According to the Commission, however, these claims were unfounded, since Usee had only nominal revenue and no financing arrangements.   The Commission alleges that the Wieses told investors that Usee was on the cusp of acquiring another VoIP company that owned valuable technology. In fact, Usee had contracted to acquire this company for $33 million, and sent the company $3 million of investor funds as a down payment. But, according the Commission, Usee and the Wieses never got close to securing funds to complete the acquisition and ultimately forfeited the funds to the other company, a fact never disclosed to investors.   Later, the Commission alleges, the Wieses released more than $1.5 million of investor funds to a company they knew nothing about, NFY Financial Consulting, PLLC. According to the SEC, NFY&rsquo;s principals &ndash; Nail Yaldo and Jack Skrelja &ndash; told the Wieses the funds would be used as &ldquo;proof of funds&rdquo; to support unspecified &ldquo;platform trading.&rdquo; The Commission further alleges that, although they did little due diligence into NFY or its principals, the Wieses assured investors that the funds would be safeguarded in an escrow account and not released for any purpose. The Wieses, however, soon turned investor funds over to NFY without investors&rsquo; consent or knowledge.   The Commission has charged the Wieses and Usee with violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission&rsquo;s complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest. The Commission also seeks to bar the Wieses from serving as officers or directors of any public company.   To settle the Commission&rsquo;s charges, the Wieses and Usee consented to permanent injunctions under Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants further agreed to disgorge nearly $5.8 million in ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and the Wieses agreed to pay civil penalties totaling $300,000. Defendants are also permanently enjoined from offering or selling securities issued by any company they own or control and the Wieses are further barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The defendants did not admit or deny the SEC&rsquo;s allegations.   The SEC&rsquo;s action also names NFY, Yaldo and Skrelja as relief defendants for purposes of recovering the funds released to NFY. The SEC has sought an asset freeze against these parties.

SEC Charges Three Former Executives of Wind Farming, Inc. with Fraud   The United States Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the Northern District of Illinois against three former executives of wind farm cooperatives:  Raymond J. McNamee, age 56, of Dana Point, California, and Anthony M. Necoechea of Newport Beach, Calif.  According to the Commission's complaint, from April 2004 through March of 2005, the former president and chief executive officer of the company engaged in a scheme to evade the registration provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to sell unregistered securities to investors who acted as purported Pennsylvania accredited investors. The complaint alleges that the defendants created artificial demand through the issuance of false and misleading press releases and through false statements posted on the Wind Farm's website. In early 2004, as part of their scheme, Mcnamee assisted Telands in forming a corporate shell with publicly traded shares. Shortly after receiving his shares, in coordination with his sales of these shares and knowing that he was selling them into the public market at artificially inflated prices, he and his entities sold their shares to public investors without registering the offerings with the SEC. To facilitate the illegal sale of those shares by the two defendants, they created an artificial supply and demand for the securities. They then sold the stock to unsuspecting investors, creating the impression that they were purchasing the shares for a legitimate business purpose. As a result of this conduct, at least three individuals and three entities they controlled, received wind Farming shares as payment for legal services and sold them for profits of approximately $430,000, or $1.2 million in net revenue for each share. This conduct violated the antifraud and securities registration requirements of Sections 5, 6, 13, 17, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 38, 41, 43, 42, 45, 52, 47,","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19802 / August 11, 2006    SEC v.

Ill, filed July 25, 2005)    On August 9, 2006, the Commission filed an amended complaint in this matter alleging that Defendant Raymond J. McNamee of Newport Beach, California violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission alleged in its initial complaint that McNamee violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and obtained a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against him and other defendants. In addition to alleging the registration violations against McNamee, the amended complaint alleges that he played a much greater role in the U.S. Wind Farming fraudulent scheme. Pursuant to McNamee's instructions, another defendant, William Telander, created U.S. Wind Farming via a series of transactions involving a corporate shell with publicly traded shares. McNamee obtained 25.1 million unregistered U.S. Wind Farming shares from Telander without paying for these shares. McNamee and Telander then drafted and issued fraudulent press releases to hype the market and bolster the prices at which McNamee and other defendants could sell their unregistered U.S. Wind Farming shares. In total, McNamee sold over 17 million U.S. Wind Farming shares for over $400,000, at prices inflated by his fraudulent conduct.

(the ""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging a former portfolio manager at a hedge fund investment adviser with insider trading based on material, nonpublic information he misappropriated from his law firm.  According to the complaint, in 2007, Arthur Cutillo and Brien P. Santarlas traded ahead of the announced corporate acquisition of Axcan Pharma Inc., using inside information stolen from their law firms in exchange for kickbacks, including information concerning upcoming acquisitions or bids involving clients of clients. The complaint alleges that in connection with this trading scheme, the defendants used a friend and fellow attorney Jason Goldfarb as a conduit to trade on confidential information about upcoming corporate acquisitions involving their firm's clients and to, among others, Franz Tudor, a fellow trader at the broker-dealer Schottenfeld Group LLC. Zvi then tipped this information to another trader, who then traded on the information, resulting in illicit profits of approximately $1.1 million. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Scolari agreed to settle the matter by consenting to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, which will be deemed satisfied by payment of restitution ordered by the court upon motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of these provisions.

SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Charges Against Former Diamondback Portfolio Manager Anthony Scolaro  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil enforcement action against Anthony Scolaro, a former portfolio manager at the hedge fund investment adviser Diamondback Capital Management, LLC, charging Scolaro with using inside information to trade ahead of the November 29, 2009 announced acquisition of Axcan Pharma Inc.  The SEC's complaint also names Diamondback as a relief defendant.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, two former attorneys with the international law firm of Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, misappropriated from their law firm material, nonpublic information concerning the acquisition of Axcan.  As alleged in the complaint, they tipped the inside information, through another attorney, to Zvi Goffer, a proprietary trader at the broker-dealer Schottenfeld Group LLC, in exchange for kickbacks.  The SEC alleges that Goffer tipped the inside information to fellow Schottenfeld proprietary trader Franz Tudor, who traded in the securities of Axcan, and tipped the information to his friend Scolaro.  The SEC alleges that based on this inside information, Scolaro traded in the securities of Axcan on behalf of a Diamondback hedge fund, resulting in illicit profits for the fund of approximately $1.1 million.   To settle the SEC's charges, Scolaro consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (ii) orders him to pay disgorgement of $125,980, prejudgment interest of $14,420, and a civil penalty of $62,945.  Diamondback, as a relief defendant, has consented to a final judgment ordering it to disgorge $962,486 in gains resulting from Scolaro's trades, plus prejudgment interest of $110,246.  In addition, Scolaro consented to the entry of an SEC order barring him from association with any investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Scolaro previously pled guilty to charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in a related criminal case, United States v. Anthony Scolaro, 11-CR-429 (S.D.N.Y.)

Wong, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No- CV-07-18192021  SEC Charges Former Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Embarcadero Technologies, Inc. with Stock Option Backdating   On December 19, 2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in San Francisco, California alleging that Stephen Wong, a former chairman, president and chief executive officer of a SanFrancisco-based software company, fraudulently hid several million dollars in employee compensation and stock option grants from the company.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from late 2000 through 2004, Wong improperly granted backdated stock options to employees at the time of the stock's initial public offering, which he falsely claimed was profitable in the past, when in fact it was actually operating at a lower price than it had been in its first quarter of 2004.&nbsp; The complaint further alleges Wong failed to disclose that the options were granted at prices below the current market price and were improperly reimbursed on the basis of inflated compensation expenses for any options granted to company employees.Â   According to the complaint, in 2002, as a result of Wong's misconduct, Argentina's stock price rose by more than 600 percent, allowing Argentina to overstate its net loss by over $530 million and cause the Company to report a loss of over 1.5 times its pre-tax net income of $1.2 million.

SEC SUES FORMER EXECUTIVES OF EMBARCADERO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. IN STOCK OPTION BACKDATING SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former senior executives of Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., alleging that they fraudulently backdated stock option grants to employees at the San Francisco business software company and reported false financial information to shareholders.  The Commission alleges that the former CEO, President and Chairman, Stephen R. Wong, the former CFO, Raj P. Sabhlok, and the former Controller, Michael C. Pattison, concealed millions of dollars in compensation expenses associated with valuable, &#8220;in-the-money&#8221; options secretly granted to company employees.    The Commission&#8217;s complaints, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, allege that Embarcadero routinely provided valuable options priced at below market prices to its employees.  The Commission alleges that the three executives allowed Embarcadero to avoid reporting expenses for these options by backdating paperwork to make it appear as if the options had been granted on an earlier date, when the stock was trading at a lower price.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaints, Embarcadero made hundreds of backdated stock option grants during 16 consecutive quarters.  As a result, the company significantly overstated its net income (or understated its net loss) from 2000 through 2005.  In the year with the largest percentage impact, Embarcadero understated its net losses by more than 500 percent.  The Commission&#8217;s complaints also allege that all three executives participated in backdating grants, each playing a role in falsifying paperwork, selecting false grant dates, and filing false financial statements.  Moreover, according to the Commission, Sabhlok and Pattison used false documents to support large option awards to themselves that were collectively &#8220;in-the-money&#8221; by almost $1.5 million&#8212;a potential windfall hidden from Embarcadero&#8217;s shareholders.

Wong also agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty.  The Commission&#8217;s litigated action against Sabhlok and Pattison charges both with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder.

The SEC also charged his friend and another individual with trading on the inside information.  The SEC alleges that Ashish Aggarwal, who worked in J.P. Morgan's San Francisco office, gleaned sensitive nonpublic information about two acquisition deals from colleagues who were working on them.  Aggarwal tipped Shahriyar Bolandian, who traded on the basis of the illegal tips in his own accounts as well as accounts belonging to his father and sister.  Bolandian also tipped his friend Kevan Sadigh so he could trade on the confidential information.  Bolandian worked at Sadigh's e-commerce company, and together they made more than $672,000 in combined profits from their insider trading.    The SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit detected the insider trading through trading data analysis tools in its Analysis and Detection Center.    In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Aggarwal, who lives in San Francisco, as well as Bolandian and Sadigh, who each live in Los Angeles.

Morgan-advised deals: Integrated Device Technology's planned acquisition of PLX Technology in 2012 and salesforce.com's acquisition of ExactTarget in 2013.&nbsp;  Aggarwal repeatedly communicated with Bolandian, his friend since college, in the days and weeks leading up to public announcements about the deals.&nbsp;  Bolandian and Sadigh bought the same series of call options in PLX Technology and ExactTarget.  Their trades were often within hours or even minutes of each other, and typically were 100 percent of the daily trading volume of those option series.&nbsp;  One of the brokerage accounts used by Bolandian was located offshore in the Bahamas.  He opened and funded the account with his credit card a week before the ExactTarget deal was announced. &nbsp;  Bolandian conducted various trades in his accounts on Aggarwal's behalf in an arrangement that enabled Aggarwal to circumvent J.P. Morgan's pre-clearance rules and potentially to share in any profits.&nbsp;    The SEC's complaint charges Aggarwal, Bolandian, and Sadigh with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.

SEC CHARGES OREGON-BASED REVENUE COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL FOR FRAUDULENT OFFERING SCHEME  The Securities &ampay Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against Lewis Elliott Graham, of Las Vegas, Nevada, and his company, FlOWorks, Inc., for their alleged fraudulent offer and sale of a property in Palo Alto, California.  According to the Commission's complaint, Graham misled the investors in order to further his personal financial interests in a water bottling venture, H2O Bottling Inc. (SSI) and other ventures he controlled, by failing to disclose important information about the transaction to SSI's investors, including millions of dollars in unreported taxable gains to investors and undisclosed liabilities secured by liens on the company's real property totaling several million dollars. The Commission alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 5(a), 6(c), and 17(e) by Graham and Floworks and the relief defendant, Linworth LLC, in connection with the sale and purchase of an asset in Eugene, Oregon. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants have consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations and ordering them to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $2.4 million and a $30,650,000 civil penalty. In a separate administrative proceeding, the U. S. Bankruptcy Commission also instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Graham in which he agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction and to an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public company for five years and from participating in any offering of securities, pursuant to federal securities laws, for a period of three years. As a result of Graham's conduct, he has been ordered to disgorge $1.2 million in ill-gotten gains and pay $3.8 million of","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20888 / February 6, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Lewis E. Graham II and FLOWorks, Inc., defendants, and Linworth LLC, relief defendant, Case No. 02:09-CV-00250 (D. Nev. February 6, 2009)  SEC Brings Fraud Charges Against Lewis E. Graham II and FLOWorks, Inc.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court of Nevada against defendants Lewis E. Graham II (&#8220;Graham&#8221;) and FLOWorks, Inc. (&#8220;FLOWorks&#8221;) and relief defendant Linworth LLC (&#8220;Linworth&#8221;) alleging fraud in connection with the securities of Stanford Square Investors LLC (&#8220;SSI&#8221;).  Graham, a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, controls FLOWorks and Linworth.  FLOWorks is the manager of SSI, a Nevada limited liability company with approximately 100 investors.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that in June 2005, SSI sold its primary asset, a commercial office building in Palo Alto, California.  Although SSI&#8217;s operating agreement provided that the company would terminate upon the sale of substantially all of its assets, in July 2005 Graham and FLOWorks, without the approval of the SSI members, caused SSI to purchase an interest in a commercial property in Eugene, Oregon.  According to the complaint, Graham&#8217;s communications to the SSI investors after the purchase misstated and omitted important information about the nature and tax-free status of the Eugene property transaction, the value of the property, liabilities to be assumed by SSI, and Graham&#8217;s personal interest in the property&#8217;s proposed tenant.  The Commission contends that these misstatements and omissions were made in connection with an offer by the purported seller of the Eugene property to purchase the membership interest of any investor that did not wish to participate in the new property venture.  With respect to those members that elected to sell, the purported buyer has failed to complete these transactions.  The Commission asserts that the actions of Graham and FLOWorks have resulted in substantial harm to SSI investors, including millions of dollars in unreported taxable gains, as well as undisclosed liabilities secured by liens on the Eugene property amounting to several million dollars.  The Commission contends that Graham misled the SSI investors in order to continue to take substantial fees from SSI and to further his personal financial interests in the new venture.   The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that Graham and FLOWorks violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and imposition of civil money penalties against Graham and FLOWorks based on their illegal conduct.   The Commission also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from Linworth based upon its improper receipt of funds from SSI.

18,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Mark Nicholas Pyatt and his company, Winston Reed Investments L.L.C., for defrauding investors by making Ponzi-like payments to other investors.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Pyaty and the company's president, Daniel Gregory Randolph, made false and misleading statements and omissions to investors in connection with their fraudulent scheme. For example, they falsely told investors that ""We had a total of $5,231 in gains &#8212; which is an astounding amount of 83.9% gain on our money in one month!""  In reality, according to these statements, the majority of the investors' funds were invested in stocks and futures contracts, and they cumulatively lost money. The complaint further alleges that, shortly before the initial investors were eligible to withdraw funds due to a purported 24-month lock-up period (when no trading activity occurred) and shortly after receiving money from investors from the alleged loss of investor funds,Pyatt allegedly misappropriated approximately $23,000 in investor money and used it to pay for his personal expenses, including vehicles, jewelry, groceries and a house in Avon, Indiana. In a parallel action, North Dakota's Attorney General's Office today filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 17(a) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aiding and abetting those violations, as well as the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and an order freezing the assets of all defendants and prohibiting them from participating in any offering of any securities. Pyatts and Randolph have agreed to settle the action by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars and other relief. They have also agreed, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of both the federal securities laws and Sections 5(d), (1), and (2) as a result of their respective misconduct, with the right to reapply after a period of five years.

According to the SEC's complaint, beginning in April 2017, Winston Reed Investments LLC and Mark N. Pyatt raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from retail investors by representing they would use a sophisticated trading strategy to trade in futures contracts, foreign exchange, and stocks.  Instead, Pyatt allegedly used the vast majority of investor money for personal items, including vehicles, jewelry, groceries, and cigars.  Winston Reed and Pyatt also allegedly used a portion of new investor money to make payments to other investors.  The complaint further alleges that in an attempt to cover up his fraud, Pyatt provided investors with updates purporting to show substantial monthly returns based on his trading, and later claimed that all investor money had been lost as a result of a broker-dealer not following his trading instructions.  The complaint charges Winston Reed and Pyatt with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks emergency relief, as well as permanent injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.

Tex., Dallas Division)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Dallas-based attorney and securities professional Gary ""Gary"" M., alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission's Complaint alleges that during the relevant period, Gary, age 60, provided tax and estate-planning advice to wealthy individuals through a private entity he controlled, The Heritage Organization LLC (Heritage), a securities broker-dealer that offered tax-shelter services and capital-gains tax advice. According to the complaint, in February 2001, the Heritage executive learned material nonpublic information concerning the acquisitions of two public companies during confidential personal meetings with senior executives of both companies. In each instance, he knew that news of such a transaction would almost certainly cause the share price of a public company to rise, as it had with MiniMed. Two days after learning the information, a hedge fund sold its shares for a profit of approximately $67,000 shortly after the acquisition was announced. By the time Hollywood announced it was being acquired by another publicly-traded casino firm in August 2002, its stock price had risen by more than 20%.  In a parallel action, on August 12, 2002 the Commission charged Gary with violating the anti-fraud and reporting provisions, and charged him with aiding and abetting those violations. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, KORNMAN has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties, with a right to reapply for an officer-and-director bar, based on his cooperation with an SEC investigation that was conducted by Stephen Webster and Timothy S.

Action No. 3:04CV1803-L (Northern District of Texas)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil lawsuit in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, alleging illegal insider trading against Alabama-licensed attorney and registered securities salesman Gary M. Kornman, 61, of Dallas, Texas.  The complaint alleges that Kornman operated a tax-planning firm, The Heritage Organization LLC, which offered tax shelters and estate planning to wealthy individuals.  On two separate instances in 2001, Kornman obtained material nonpublic information concerning acquisitions of public companies in confidential discussions with prospective tax-planning clients, each of whom faced significant capital-gains taxes as a result of the planned sale of their respective companies.  Specifically, the complaint alleges:   In February 2001, Kornman learned in a confidential meeting with an executive of MiniMed, Inc., a Nasdaq-listed medical-equipment company, that there was a ""70% chance"" that MiniMed would be acquired in approximately four months by a Fortune 100 company.  Two days after learning this information, Kornman purchased 6600 shares of MiniMed for approximately $38 per share on behalf of a hedge fund he controlled.  In May 2001, MiniMed announced it was being acquired by Medtronic, Inc. for $48 per share, and Kornman's hedge fund profited by approximately $67,000 when the merger ultimately took place in August 2001.    In a November 2001 meeting with a board member of Hollywood Casino Corporation, an Amex-listed company, Kornman learned that Hollywood would ""definitely"" be sold to another company in the near future within a certain price range per share.  Upon learning this information, Kornman began acquiring Hollywood shares in the account of another hedge fund he controlled at an average price below the price range he had learned in the confidential meeting.  By the time Hollywood announced it was being acquired by another publicly held casino firm in August 2002, Kornman's hedge fund had acquired 29,900 shares at an average cost below the announced acquisition price.  At Kornman's direction, the hedge fund sold all of these shares for a profit of approximately $75,000 shortly after the merger was announced.    The SEC's complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Kornman from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1034 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  It also seeks disgorgement of $142,231 in illegal profits plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.

""B. N., of Chicago, Illinois,"" and his wholly-owned company, BC I Aircraft Lasing Inc. (""BCI""), alleging that they conducted a massive PONZI scheme from 1999 through 2006, raising over $82 million from at least 120 investors.  According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants told numerous investors and potential investors that:  investor money would be used to purchase specifically identified aircraft on behalf of the investors' LLCs; investors would receive regular monthly returns from the lease income from aircraft owned by the particular LLC; and investors were entitled to half of all proceeds from lease revenue obtained from such aircraft sales.&nbsp;  Investors were supposed to receive monthly payments from these revenues, but were not told that their money was actually being used as represented; the majority of investor funds were commingled in a bank account in BCi's name, along with proceeds derived from sales of aircraft, and proceeds of bank loans. The complaint also alleges that defendants used a significant portion of these funds to pay for personal expenses, including three expensive homes and luxury automobiles. In addition, in 2007 the complaint alleges, defendants continued their scheme by fraudulently repurchasing interests in other entities controlled and managed by and using the funds for their own personal use. Finally, as alleged, defendant Hollgel used approximately $36 million of this total to buy three luxury vehicles and three large homes for himself and several investors in an effort to conceal his fraud from investors who were told they were investing in these entities and were receiving returns of up to 30% per year.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced that on August 22, 2007, after a two-day evidentiary hearing, the Honorable Elaine E. Bucklo of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued a preliminary injunction against Brian N. Hollnagel (""Hollnagel"") and BCI Aircraft Leasing, Inc. (""BCI""), enjoining Hollnagel and BCI from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, in addition to other relief.  Previously, on August 13, 2007, the Commission filed a civil injunctive complaint alleging that Hollnagel and BCI, from 1999 through 2006, raised at least $82 million from approximately 120 investors through the fraudulent offer and sale of membership shares of Limited Liability Corporations (""LLCs"") controlled and managed by BCI. According to the complaint, Hollnagel, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, and BCI, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, told investors that they would use investor funds to purchase specifically identified commercial aircraft for the LLCs and, in turn, lease the aircraft to commercial airlines. According to the complaint, investors were told they would receive part of the lease revenue from the particular aircraft, in the form of regular monthly payments, as their return. The complaint further alleged that the Defendants also told investors that if an aircraft owned by an LLC was sold, investors were entitled to half of all proceeds from the sale above and beyond their capital contribution. In reality, according to the complaint, Defendants operated a massive Ponzi scheme. In addition, the complaint alleged that, in 2007, Defendants continued their scheme by fraudulently repurchasing investors' interests through materially misleading statements. Finally, the complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Hollnagel and BCI violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  In its Memorandum and Order, the Court found that the Commission had satisfied its burden of proof and was entitled to a preliminary injunction. The Court further found, among other things:   It is undisputed that BCI made material representations in its LLC offering documents that the investors were buying shares in an LLC that would purchase a specific aircraft that in many cases were not true.&nbsp;  There can be no doubt that BCI and Hollnagel acted with scienter.   As a result, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against Hollnagel and BCI enjoining them from further violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court declined, however, to grant the Commission's request for an asset freeze or the appointment of a receiver at this time to give BCI and Hollnagel the opportunity to fulfill their promise to pay investors within 60 days the $48 million that is due to them. The Court further provided that, among other things:   If BCI does not repay the investors within 60 days, or for any other reason it becomes apparent before that time that BCI will not be able to pay the investors, the Court will reconsider the Commission's request for a freeze of assets and appointment of receiver; and&nbsp;  BCI must provide certain reports to the Commission on a weekly basis and must provide notice to the Commission prior to any significant withdrawals (in excess of $20,000).   # # #     Additional Materials:  SEC Complaint in this matter  Memorandum Opinion and Order   &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20254.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 08/24/2007",0.6675,0.5149

Westelman and Steven Forman, the former CFO and controller of Speechworks International, Inc. (now a part of Nuance, Inc.). The Commission charged that Westelman, a resident of Scituate, Massachusetts, and Forman, a resident of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Speechworks' revenues and misstate other important financial metrics so as to deceive investors as to the company's true financial condition. The Commission also charged Arthur Haberman, Speechworks' former director of finance, with violating and aiding and abetting Speechworks' violations of various books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. Both Westelman and Haberman have agreed to settle with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.

The Commission's complaint, dated June 21, 2007, alleges that from at least 2001 through at least 2003, Westelman and Forman engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate Speechworks' revenues and misstate other key financial information. According to the complaint, Westelman negotiated and approved a series of transactions between Speechworks and one of its key resellers, Intervoice, Inc., that called for the reseller to make royalty payments prior to its shipment of software to end customers. For one transaction, the complaint alleges Westelman requested Intervoice to provide falsified documents that allowed him to improperly recognize as revenue a $900,000 cash payment Intervoice made in return for amending a warrant Speechworks had previously issued to Intervoice. For another transaction, the complaint alleges that Westelman and Forman schemed to recognize as revenue $2 million in prepayments to Speechworks, even though they knew the deal was not properly documented and did not otherwise qualify for revenue recognition under Speechworks' policies and GAAP. The complaint further claims that Westelman and Forman purposefully misled Speechworks' external auditors about the terms of the deal and, among other things, permitted the auditors to rely on documents that they knew to be false and misleading. The complaint also alleges that Westelman helped Intervoice improperly recognize revenue. Finally, the complaint alleges that Haberman improperly recorded Intervoice's royalty prepayments as revenue in the company's books and records.  The complaint alleges that through their conduct, Westelman and Forman variously violated, or aided and abetted Speechworks' violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, aided and abetted Speechworks' violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and Westelman also aided and abetted Intervoice's violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Haberman violated Rule13b2-1 of the Exchange Act and aided and abetted Speechworks' violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2014, investors were told that accounts without payment or remittance for thirty-two consecutive consecutive days would be declared non-performing and subsequently written-off. The complaint further alleged that the company granted forbearance from remittances to accounts that were unable to make payments and failed to designate the accounts as ""non-performing.""  According to the SEC, however, as a result of this practice, certain accounts lost their ability to repay the loans in the securitization, resulting in substantial losses to investors. In addition, CAN CAPITAL's offering materials and other materials did not adequately describe how it treated and disclosed these accounts and the risk that they would not timely pay or default as they become due. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and its allegations,CAN Capital has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering it to pay a $10 million civil penalty and to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of those provisions. CAN also has agreed to be enjoined from participating in future offerings of securities that are subject to court approval. This is the second SEC enforcement action related to this matter. On May 9, 2018, a federal court in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order against CAN and ordered the repatriation of assets from the U.S. to Canada and Mexico, freezing assets and prohibiting CAN's assets in a related administrative proceeding. Accordingly, on May 5, 2019, an SEC hearing was held to determine the amount of disgorgement and civil money penalties that CAN will be assessed against the remaining assets of CAN, including $8.5 million in assets that should have been deemed nonperforming by the time the securities were issued. As part of its investigation, which is continuing, Canadian Securities Commission (CSC) staff has been investigating the matter and are preparing to conduct a hearing on the same issues. A related SEC investigation was conducted by Joshua Brodsky, Richard Hong, William Finkel and Richard Lauchlan, who will lead the litigation.","On May 4, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against small business lender CAN Capital, Inc. for misleading investors in an offering that raised $191 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, CAN Capital's offering involved the securitization of a revolving pool of merchant cash advances and small business loans.  The complaint alleges that CAN Capital disclosed to investors that it was required to maintain a minimum amount of receivables in the revolving pool, which included writing off delinquent accounts and replacing them with performing assets.  According to the complaint, however, CAN Capital failed to disclose its practice of granting forbearance, known as grace days, to certain accounts unable to make loan payments.  The complaint alleges that these accounts often remained as collateral for the securitization, even as they became non-performing.  By November 2016, CAN Capital's collateral for the securitization allegedly contained millions of dollars of non-performing assets that should have been removed from the securitization, which resulted in losses to investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges CAN Capital with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Rex Venture Group LLC et al., U.S. District Court for Western District of North Carolina (Civil Action No. 3:12-CV-519)  SEC FILES ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO HALT $600 MILLION PYRAMID AND PONZI SCHEME  NORTH CAROLINA COMPANY SOLICITED INVESTORS OVER INTERNET  Company and its Principal Consent to Relief that Court Immediately Orders, Including Asset Freeze, Appointment of Receiver, and Payment of a $4 Million Penalty  On August 17, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Rex Venture Group LLC d/b/a ZeekRewards.com and Paul R. Burks, alleging that the defendants had been operating a combined Ponzi and Pyramid scheme. According to the Complaint, online marketer Paul Burks of Lexington, N.C. and his company Rex Venture Group raised more than $600 million from more than one million Internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website ZeekRewards.com, which they began in January 2011.  The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the Internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described âaffiliate advertising divisionâ for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which â the âRetail Profit Poolâ and the âMatrixâ â involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws.  According to the Complaint, defendants promised investors a share of the companyâs daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The defendants represented that those daily awards were calculated by dividing up to 50 percent of the companyâs ânet profitsâ by the number of âprofit pointsâ outstanding among all âqualified affiliates,â with those purported calculations consistently resulting in daily dividends averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the investor payouts bore no relation to the companyâs net profits. Most of ZeekRewardsâ total revenues and the ânet profitsâ paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion.  The Complaint further alleged that the scheme was teetering on collapse with investor funds at risk of dissipation without its emergency enforcement action. Last month, ZeekRewards brought in approximately $162 million while total investor cash payouts were approximately $160 million. If customers had continued increasingly to elect to receive cash payouts rather than reinvest their money to reach higher levels of rewards points, ZeekRewardsâ cash outflows would have quickly exceeded its total revenue.  The Commission alleged that the defendants offered and sold securities in violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. In addition, the Commission filed motions asking the Court to freeze Rex Ventureâs assets and appoint a receiver over the company and its assets.  Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, and simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the defendants consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions. Burks also agreed to relinquish his interest in the company and its assets, and to pay a $4 million civil penalty. On Friday afternoon, August 17, 2012, the Court entered the consented-to judgments imposing the foregoing relief, and also ordered an emergency asset freeze and appointed a receiver, both as requested by the Commission. According to the Complaint, ZeekRewards holds approximately $225 million in investor funds in 15 foreign and domestic financial institutions. Those funds have been ordered frozen under the emergency asset freeze granted by the court at the SECâs request. Additionally, under the Courtâs order, the receiver has been tasked to collect, marshal, manage and distribute remaining assets for return to harmed investors.  The receiver has established the following website as his primary means of communicating with investors: http://www.zeekrewardsreceivership.com. The Receiver may also be contacted via email at info@zeekrewardsreceivership.com. Investors are encouraged to monitor the Receiverâs website for updates concerning the claims process and for updates regarding the status of their claims.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, alleges that, from at least January 2013 through December 2018, defendants raised over $4 million from over 70 retail investors, many of whom were elderly and unsophisticated in investment matters, by falsely stating that investor funds would be used to fund the development and commercialization of a new form of aspirin to instantly stop heart attacks and strokes. According to the SEC, in reality, no such investment was ever made. Instead of using investor proceeds to pay operating expenses to further the company's efforts to develop a legitimate product for heart attack and stroke prevention, as alleged in the defendants' offering documents and in public filings, Miln allegedly used the majority of the funds for his personal benefit, including, among other things, boating expenses, clothing, spa treatments, divorce payments, and to sustain the operations of his remote-controlled toy racecar business, Island Raceway & Hobby Inc.

The Commission alleges that, beginning in August 2007, the managing director of a bank and private lender firm supplied William James ""Bill"" ""Billy"" D'Avino with the account statements of innocent customers, and then falsified the accounts to make it appear that they belonged to him.  In a parallel action, on December 6, 2009, a federal district court in California entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against DelBiio, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), and (3) the securities laws and with aiding and abetting the scheme by the Commission. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, all defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement of over $1.5 million, prejudgment interest of $2.1 million and a civil penalty of more than $100,000. In addition, in a related criminal proceeding, Delbiio pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and other securities fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud investors and lenders out of approximately $65 million in loans by falsely representing that the loans were secured by collateral and that he would use the funds to purchase an interest in an NHL hockey team. According to a complaint filed in federal court for Northern California, from at least 2003 through 2007 Deli raised over a half-million dollars from investors by capitalizing on his reputation as a prominent venture capital and founder and CEO of an established firm.

""Boots"" Del Biaggio III with Defrauding Clients and Banks out of $65 Million  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a civil injunctive action against Silicon Valley venture capitalist, William J. ""Boots"" Del Biaggio III, in federal district court in the Northern District of California alleging that he engaged in two distinct securities fraud schemes, defrauding investors, banks and private lenders out of $65 million.  The complaint alleges that Del Biaggio used the funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle, which included buying an interest in a professional hockey team, satisfying substantial gambling debts, and paying expenses on his family's luxury home.  Without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, Del Biaggio has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Del Biaggio also has agreed that, at a later date, the court in this matter shall determine the amount of ill-gotten gains (disgorgement) and civil monetary penalties that Del Biaggio shall be required to pay.  According to the Commission's complaint, Del Biaggio engaged in two distinct securities fraud schemes.  First, Del Biaggio fraudulently pledged securities owned by innocent customers of a San Francisco-based broker dealer as collateral for more than $45 million in personal loans.  Beginning in August 2007, Del Biaggio obtained brokerage account statements of unknowing customers with the help of a friend who was a managing director at a San Francisco brokerage firm, and then falsified the account statements to make it appear that Del Biaggio owned the assets in the accounts.  To obtain more than $45 million in loan proceeds, Del Biaggio supplied the forged account statements to multiple banks and private lenders and signed agreements pledging the securities in the innocent customers' accounts.  As alleged in the complaint, Del Biaggio used $25 million of the loan proceeds to purchase an interest in the Nashville Predators professional hockey team, and used the rest for other personal expenses.  In the second scheme, according to the Commission's complaint, Del Biaggio misappropriated more than $19 million from individual investors he advised.  The Commission alleges that between 2003 and 2008, Del Biaggio used his reputation as a prominent venture capitalist and role as the founder and CEO of established venture firm Sand Hill Capital L.P. to entice dozens of his advisory clients to invest in three investment funds he formed.  The complaint alleges that Del Biaggio then misappropriated the money or used it to buy stocks which he then pledged as collateral for personal loans.  The Commission alleges that Del Biaggio used the proceeds of his fraud to pay for other business and personal expenses.  Separately today, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California (USAO) also filed criminal charges arising from some of the same conduct that is alleged in the Commission's complaint.

Barber, Civil Action No. 1:01CV02670 (United States District Court for the District of Columbia)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced that on June 3, 2001, it filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Washington DC charging a former registered representative with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the violations of Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4) in the Commission's Complaint in this action. The Commission alleges that Larry B. Barber, a resident of Waverly, Wash., raised approximately $1.5 million from investors by selling unregistered securities in connection with a series of fraudulent transactions that he orchestrated and caused to generate more than $600,000 in investor funds. According to the complaint, Barber sold the securities while in possession of material non-public information about the transactions to his broker-dealer, which he used to trade securities for his personal benefit and to pay personal expenses, including rent and a mortgage on his home, car, house, jewelry, home equity investments, retirement accounts, 401(k) statements and other financial documents. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the former chief executive officer and controller of Barber's company have consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Barber from violating Section 15(d)(e) the federal securities laws and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date. In addition, on July 20, 2002, Judge James A. Currid entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, other emergency relief and an order barring Barber and his company from associating with any investment adviser, dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization for a period of five years.

NELSON BARBER (United States District Court for the District of Columbia, C. A. No. 1:01CV02670).  On December 27, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in U.S. District Court against Nelson Barber, the former Chief Financial Officer of Fine Host Corporation, alleging that Barber caused Fine Host to engage in an extensive financial fraud.  Fine Host, a provider of food and beverage services to sports arenas, prisons, and schools, was at that time a public company with common stock listed for trading on the Nasdaq National Market System and a market capitalization that reached approximately $390 million.  When the fraud was detected, the stock lost essentially all of its value.  Fine Host subsequently entered a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, from which it emerged as a private company.  According to the Commission's complaint:     The fraud predated Fine Host's June 1996 initial public offering by several years and continued through the third quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997;   The primary mechanism of the fraudulent scheme was the improper capitalization of millions of dollars of company expenses as assets;   Barber also caused Fine Host to manipulate acquisition reserve accounts, income from vendor rebates, and other items for the purpose of managing reported earnings;   In February 1998 Fine Host issued a restatement of its financial statements indicating that from 1992 through the third quarter of 1997, Fine Host overstated its pretax income by over $49 million.  For fiscal years 1994, 1995 and 1996, Fine Host overstated its pretax income by 149%, 213%, and 197%, respectively.  For the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 1997, the Company overstated its pretax income by 324%, 320%, and 170%, respectively.  The Complaint alleges that Barber, through the conduct described above, violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&quot;Securities Act&quot;), and Sections 10(b), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, promulgated thereunder, and aided and abetted Fine Host's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  In settlement of the Commission's claims, Barber, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, consented to the entry of a Final Judgment of the District Court: 1) permanently enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of each of the above provisions of the securities laws; 2) permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of any public company; and 3) ordering him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.  In related matters, the Commission issued settled administrative actions against three certified public accountants:  Rachel Eckhaus, the former assistant controller of Fine Host; Jeffrey Bascik, the engagement partner for the Deloitte &amp; Touche audits of Fine Host's financial statements for the affected periods; and Barbara Horvath, the Deloitte &amp; Touche manager on certain of those audit engagements.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, each respondent consented to the entry of a Commission Order finding, among other things, that the respondent engaged in improper professional conduct for purposes of Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.  The Order in Horvath's case censures her and the Orders in Eckhaus's and Bacsik's cases deny them both the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with the right to request reinstatement after two years.

Robert Louis Carver, et al., Civil Action Number SACV 8-627 CJC (RNBx) (C.D. Cal.)  SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPALS WITH FRAUD AND MISUSE OF INVESTMENT FUNDS  On December 16, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Irvine, California-based Brookstone Capital, Inc. (""Brookstone""), a company controlled by Robert L. ""Carver,"" the majority shareholder, majority control person, and president of Lincoln Funds, a purported consulting and investment advisory firm based in Costa Mesa, Calif.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, from at least 2004 through 2008, defendants fraudulently raised $15 million from investors through a series of unregistered offerings of common stock and limited partnership interests in three limited partnerships, Lincoln Biotech Ventures, LP (LBV I), LBV II, L,P., and LP 111 (LBDV 11), and failed to disclose material information about the defendants' prior felony convictions, including prior criminal convictions and the 1996 CA Bar Order. The complaint further alleges defendants misrepresented to investors that the funds were the successor to Brookfield, that they would use the proceeds to fund an initial public offering (IPO) within 18 to 24 months of the IPO and that their purported IPO would be an IPO within a short period of time. In fact, according to the SEC, these statements were false and misleading. Additionally, as alleged in the Complaint, Defendants have engaged in numerous activities to perpetrate and continue the fraud. Most recently, on June 3,2008, defendant James Lowell DeMers, of Cerritos, CA, allegedly misappropriated $2.9 million of investors' funds by transferring that amount to an account in his son's brokerage account, which was used to cold-call investors and solicit them to purchase securities in a limited liability partnership.

Robert Louis Carver; Robert Louis Carver, II; James Lowell Demers; Lincoln Funds International, Inc., and Paropes Corporation, f/k/a Brookstone Capital, Inc., Defendants, and Lincoln Biotech Ventures, L.P.; Lincoln Biotech Ventures II, L.P.; Lincoln Biotech Ventures III, L.P., and MacAuslan Capital Partners, LLC, as Relief Defendants, Case No. CV08-627 CJC (RNBx) (C.D. Cal.)  SEC Halts a $21 Million Fraud Involving Biotech Investment Funds  The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday announced an action charging advisory firm Lincoln Funds International, Inc. and its three principals who raised at least $21 million from nearly 400 investors nationwide in an alleged securities fraud scheme that involved its biotechnology investment fund companies.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Orange County, one of the defendants, James L. DeMers, age 64, of Cerritos, Calif., cleaned out all of the cash in the Lincoln Funds' accounts earlier this month by transferring approximately $2.9 million to his own separate company.  The SEC obtained a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief in a civil action to halt the defendants' fraudulent activities and strip them of any ill-gotten gains.  Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission's complaint on June 6, the California Department of Corporations issued an Order against two of the individuals and Lincoln Funds ordering them to desist and refrain from offering, buying or selling securities in the state by means of any false or misleading statements.  The Commission's complaint charges Lincoln Funds and its predecessor, Brookstone Capital, Inc., both based in Costa Mesa, Calif., and their principals, Robert L. Carver, age 53, of Irvine, Calif., his son Robert L. Carver, II, age 34, of Irvine, Calif., and DeMers.  The complaint also names as relief defendants Lincoln Biotech Ventures LP, Lincoln Biotech Ventures II, and LP Lincoln Biotech Ventures III LP &mdash; the three biotechnology venture funds created and controlled by the defendants.  Also named is MacAuslan Capital Partners, LLC, a company controlled by DeMers.  These relief defendants held cash or other assets acquired from investor proceeds.  Robert Carver has been the subject of at least five state administrative orders including three by the California Department of Corporations since 1996.  The Commission's complaint alleges that since April 2004, the defendants sold securities in Brookstone Capital, Lincoln Funds, and three Lincoln Biotech Venture funds created purportedly for making biotechnology-related investments.  The defendants enticed investors by dangling the prospect of an upcoming initial public offering in Brookstone Capital and later, Lincoln Funds, when they knew full well that no steps had been taken for this purpose.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants made baseless predictions about the eight- to ten-fold appreciation in the entities' projected stock price, and engaged in a sham transaction designed to hold Lincoln Funds out as a company with no connection to Brookstone Capital or Carver, which were subjects of state regulatory orders.  The defendants additionally concealed Carver's prior criminal record, and failed to invest investor funds in biotechnology ventures, as promised.  At least $2.5 million of the proceeds remain unaccounted for.  Acting on the Commission's lawsuit, on June 6, 2008, the Honorable Judge Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing the defendants' and relief defendants' assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents.  The Court also appointed James H. Donell as the temporary receiver over the assets of Brookstone Capital, Lincoln Funds, and its affiliates, including the three Lincoln Biotech Venture funds.  The Court ordered the temporary restraining order and asset freeze to remain in effect until June 19, 2008, on which date the Court will hold a hearing on the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver at 10:00 a.m.  In addition to emergency relief, the Commission's complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, repayment of all ill-gotten gains, and also civil penalties.  The Commission's complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that all three individuals violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, the Commission alleges that Lincoln Funds and DeMers violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

30,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an alleged $102 million Ponzi scheme that has defrauded at least 637 investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Perry Santillo, Christopher Parris, Paul LaRocco, John Piccarreto, Thomas Brenner, First NationleSolution, LLC, Percipience Global Corporation, and United RL Capital Services (collectively, ""Defendants"") have raised more than $100 million from investors since July 2011. The complaint further alleges the defendants have misappropriated investor funds for their own personal use, including to pay for luxury cars, luxury homes, vacations, parties, a Las Vegas nightclub, lavish nightclubs and a nightclub. According to the complaint, the majority of the funds raised have been used to repay investors who had been promised returns of 7% to 9% per year. In a parallel action the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1), and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1)(2) ofÂ the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 17(e) the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants have consented to a permanent injunction, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon; and from participating in any offering of securities that may be registered with the SEC pursuant to Rule 17a-14. Additionally, defendants will be barred from appearing for five years from association with any FINRA-registered broker-dealer.In a related criminal action, filed on March 5, 2015 in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., the Commission charged that defendants operated a $103 million, multi-million dollar investment scheme from 2011 to 2012, which raised over $107 million for a purported real estate development project in Texas and Ohio. Among other things, they allegedly misused investor money for personal expenses, such as car rentals, entertainment, hotels, condominiums, liquor stores, home furnishings, sporting goods, jewelry, medical services, health care, public radio, radio and television, real-estate development, investment advice and other services. They also allegedly solicited investors by falsely","Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges and obtained an asset freeze against the individuals and companies behind a $102 million Ponzi scheme that bilked investors throughout the U.S.  According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants defrauded more than 600 investors through sales of securities in issuers they controlled, including First Nationle Solution LLC, United RL Capital Services, and Percipience Global Corp.  The complaint alleges that investors were told that their funds would be used for the companies and some were guaranteed dividends or double-digit returns.  But, according to the complaint, the defendants spent at least $20 million to enrich themselves, paid $38.5 million in Ponzi-like payments, and transferred much of the remainder in transactions that appear unrelated to the issuers' purported businesses.  The complaint charges Perry Santillo, of Rochester, New York, Christopher Parris, also of Rochester, Paul LaRocco, of Ocala, Florida, John Piccarreto, of San Antonio, and Thomas Brenner, of Orville, Ohio, along with the three companies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, Brenner, and the three issuers with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It further charges Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, and Brenner with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and aiding and abetting the three issuers' violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Utah)   SEC Charges Val E. Southwick, His Companies, and Their Principals with Fraudulent Offer and Sale of Unregistered Securities in Utah  On February 7, 2007, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, charging Utah-based Vescorp Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with conducting a fraudulent offering of unregistered securities.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from approximately 1990 through at least 2002, VesCor Capital and its subsidiaries, which were headquartered in Ogden, Utah and operated as ""Vescor Capital,"" used approximately 150 corporations and limited liability companies to raise money from investors and develop and manage real estate projects. The complaint further alleges, in connection with the sale of the notes and other securities, Southwick and his companies raised approximately $180 million through the fraudulent offer and sales of securities to investors. According to the complaint, these companies offered and sold the securities in various ways, including offering and selling unsecured notes claiming to pay returns of between 8% and 24% per year, ostensibly to finance several real-estate developments. However, rather than using investor funds to develop specific real property projects, as promised, he used investor money to repay earlier investors, pay new investors' living expenses and fund the ongoing expenses of his enterprise. Virtually all of these developments were unprofitable. In addition, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, S.E.C., the VesCor enterprise was a Ponzi scheme, operating from a now-defunct registered broker-dealer, using new investor monies to make payments to existing investors in advance of a May 2006 ""fire sale"" of an unincorporated property in Las Vegas, Nevada. As a result, investors were told their money would be used to fund either a specific property project or a group of projects; however, they were not told that their investments were secured by interests in those projects and that they would receive monthly interest until the property was fully developed or sold at a later date. Instead, instead of using the money for specific purposes, such as developing specific","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20450 / February 6, 2008  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

SEC Files Civil Action Against VesCor Capital Corp. and Val E. Southwick    The Commission has filed a civil action seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties against VesCor Capital Corp., Val E. Southwick and four related companies in connection with VesCor's and Southwick's fraudulent offers and sales of approximately $180 million in notes to over 800 investors since the early 1990's. The Commission's complaint alleges that many of VesCor's investors were senior citizens who invested substantial portions of their savings or mortgaged their homes to pay for the investments.  The complaint alleges the defendants engaged in a fraudulent, unregistered offering of notes by VesCor-related companies, all of which were controlled by Southwick. The defendants allegedly promised annual returns of 8% to 24% , with the returns being generated by profits from VesCor's real estate projects. The complaint further alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations concerning those real estate projects and operated a Ponzi scheme in which newly invested funds were often used: (1) to pay the promised returns to earlier investors, (2) to fund Southwick's and his family's living expenses and (3) to pay the operating expenses of the VesCor enterprise. Southwick allegedly made a variety of misrepresentations to investors, including: (1) invested funds would be used to develop specific real estate projects; (2) the real estate developments were highly profitable, and (3) the investment risk was nonexistent or extremely limited because investments were secured by recorded property interests or were highly collateralized. Finally, the complaint alleges that, contrary to VesCor and Southwick's representations, investor funds were used in whatever manner Southwick chose, VesCor's real estate projects were not profitable and VesCor's operations were insolvent and could not continue operating without continually obtaining new investor money.  It is alleged that through this conduct the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges the defendants raised the money by inducing borrowers to transfer ownership of millions of shares of publicly traded stock to them as collateral for purported non-recourse loans based on a false promise to return the shares to borrowers who repaid their loans. Unbeknownst to the borrowers, however, they retained substantial sales proceeds, even after funding each loan.

(collectively, the One Equity Companies) with operating an ongoing fraudulent stock loan program.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, since at least 2004, the Spillans, who are residents of Gahanna, Ohio, and the One Equity Companies, which are located in Westerville, Ohio, raised approximately $70 million from 125 borrowers by holding themselves out as stock based lenders, underwriters, or administrators. According to the complaint, the defendants raised the money by inducing borrowers to transfer ownership of millions of shares of publicly traded stock to them as collateral for purported non-recourse loans based on a false promise to return the shares to borrowers who repaid their loans. In fact, the defendants generally sold all of the stock received from borrowers before funding each loan. After funding each loan, the Spillans did not set aside any cash reserves to repurchase and return shares to borrowers who repaid their loans. Instead, they used all of the money to pay expenses, including over $1 million in salaries and benefits to themselves.  In an order dated July 10, the Honorable Judge Edmund A. Sargus, Jr. entered a temporary restraining order that, among other things, prohibits defendants from making any loans, making any disbursements from business accounts without prior Court approval, paying salaries to the Spillans, and destroying or discarding any relevant financial records.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that from approximately December 2017 through February 2019, Dosa obtained nearly $98,000 from 41 investors, about a quarter of whom were cadets at the United States Air Force Academy (AFA), under the guise that he would day-trade stocks on their behalf. Rather than trading stocks as he promised, he used most of the investor funds to pay back prior investors and for personal expenses, including gambling and jewelry. In reality, according to the SEC, rather than investing in stocks, the vast majority of which he received from investors were used to make payments to other investors or to perpetuate the fraud while misappropriating the remainder. The complaint further alleges, however, that for the most recent period of his fraud, as well as in some instances, when he did not trade stocks at all, his scheme continued. He used investor money to repay earlier investors in early 2019 and used the remaining funds for other purposes, such as gambling, jewelry, and gambling. To conceal his misconduct, a court order temporarily enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, prejudgment interest and a penny stock bar against him.

The Commission's complaint alleges that from at least June 2004 through April 2005, the defendants manipulated and supported the price and liquidity of the company's common stock through fraudulent stock transactions. According to the complaint, these manipulative trades were designed to create the false appearance of an active and liquid market for stock in order to facilitate the sale of our stock at artificially inflated levels. In some instances, they orchestrated ""marking-the-close"" transactions, in which the defendant used two brokerage accounts he established in his own name and that of his law firm to execute transactions in ourida stock on the open market.

According to the Complaint, beginning at least as early as July 2002 and continuing through at least October 22, 2002, Fontaine and Signature deceived investors into investing in Signature by fraudulently claiming, among other things, that:  (a) Signature ""averaged over a 39.5% annual return"" over its 13-year history, including returns ""during the bear market of the past 2 years [of ] over 21% per year;"" (b) Signature had approximately $250 million under management; (c) Salomon Smith Barney was the sub-adviser to Signature; and (d) KPMG, LLP performed certain auditing services for Signature.  The defendants also made false and misleading statements about various investment advisory services purportedly offered by Signature, such as a Roth IRA program and a 401(k) program.  All of these representations were false.  Signature and Fontaine had no track record, much less the long and extraordinary one they claimed.  Fontaine simply made up the performance returns  in Signature's marketing materials.  Signature never had anywhere near $250 million under management.  Salomon Smith Barney was not advising Signature, and KPMG did not provide  auditing or any other services to Signature.  A purported KPMG audit report Fontaine sent to prospective investors was a forgery.  The 401(k), IRA and other managed accounts described in Signature's marketing materials did not exist.  The Complaint charges Fontaine and Signature with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and charges Signature with violating Section 7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The Commission has applied for a preliminary injunction, expedited discovery and other interim relief.  Fontaine and Signature have consented to the requested interim relief, and to transfer to the Court registry funds in two Signature accounts, for return to investors.  The litigation is pending.

Arizona)  SEC Charges Former CEO of Bancorp International Group, Inc. with Securities Fraud   The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against former chief executive officer and director of a penny stock company.  According to the Commission's complaint, from early 2005 through at least July 2005, Mario ""Pino,"" a resident of Paradise Valley, Arizona, devised a scheme to usurp the ""corporate identity"" and to profit from the sale of the company's stock. At the time, BCIT was an over-the-counter pink sheet company that traded as a shell and was deficient in its filings with the SEC. To facilitate a market for these fraudulent shares, he also issued multiple false press releases, and issued millions of shares of fraudulent stock to himself and others. The Commission alleges that, to facilitate the market in which the stock sales were being sold, the former CEO and Director of Mellon Research issued and disseminated false stock certificates bearing the same CUSP number as the real name, which he then sold into the inflated market. In a parallel action, on February 24, 2007, a federal district court in Denver entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze, freezing the defendants' assets and appointing a receiver to marshal the assets of each defendant and the relief defendants obtained against them. Without admitting or denying the allegations in today's Commission filing, Bino has agreed to a permanent injunction from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5(a) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as to pay disgorgement of $269,033, plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties equal to his ill-gotten gains, including pre-judgment and post-tax interest, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion motion by B.

The complaint also alleges that Pino issued false press releases between May 2 and July 13, 2005, and issued millions of shares of fraudulent BCIT stock to himself and others. The complaint alleges Pino sold 175,005,000 shares, earning profits of $269,033, in unregistered, non-exempt transactions into the resulting inflated market.   The complaint alleges that Pino violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Zak, Civil Action No 06CV2401 (RCC) (SDNY)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, on April 13, 2005, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other relief to halt an alleged insider trading scheme involving the securities of Connetics Corp., a Palo Alto, California-based marketer and developer of dermatological products.  According to the SEC's amended Complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on June 19, it alleges that Alexander ""Y.J.,"" the former Vice President of Biostatistics and Clinical Operations of the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""), participated in a telephone call with FDA staff discussing the results of a carcinogenicity study of Velac Gel, a developmental stage acne medication that the Company was projecting would contribute significantly to its near-term and long term financial performance.&nbsp;  On April 21, at 2:15 p.m. EST, Zak sold 5,000 shares in his own brokerage account and purchased 2,025 shares from his nominee account in order to profit from the sale of his stock in advance of an announcement by the company announcing that its stock price had fallen 27% from its previous close on volume of more than 30 times its 30-day moving average during the previous three trading days. The SEC further alleged that on the same day the FDA announced its negative view on a cancer-related study on mice that had been conducted by a former FDA employee, Yarashinsky, purchased 1,250 ConNETics put contracts and sold a previously-acquired long position in its securities, which he sold at the close of business on Friday, June 10, after the announcement was made public. In a parallel criminal action, he has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and cooperated with the Department of Justice's Criminal Division in connection with this matter.

Alexander J. Yaroshinsky, Civil Action No. 06CV2401 (S.D.N.Y., filed March 28, 2006)  SEC Charges Massachusetts Man with Illegally Trading on Inside Tip from Drug Executive  Commission adds defendant to insider trading case against executive who traded on FDA comments about carcinogenicity tests of acne drug    The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing yesterday of an Amended Complaint in SEC v. Yaroshinsky, a case pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Amended Complaint adds Victor E. Zak as a defendant in the Commission's previously filed insider trading case against California drug executive Alexander J. Yaroshinsky. The Amended Complaint alleges that Zak, a resident of Newton, Massachusetts, received material non-public information from Yaroshinsky concerning the FDA staff's preliminary analysis of the carcinogenicity tests of Velac Gel, an acne drug being developed by Yaroshinsky's then employer, California-based Connetics Corporation. The Amended Complaint alleges that both Zak and Yaroshinsky traded on the basis of this information. In the end, Zak profited from his illegal trading by more than $900,000 and together, Yaroshinsky and Zak benefited financially by more than $1.58 million.   The Amended Complaint alleges that on April 13, 2005, at 2:15 p.m. Yaroshinsky and other representatives of Connetics participated on a telephone call with FDA staff, during which the FDA staff told Connetics that the FDA's Executive Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee had concluded that the Velac Gel vehicle may be a ""tumor promoter or a carcinogen"" and that ""this is a serious issue for a topical product for the treatment of acne&#133; ."" Shortly after the call, Yaroshinsky called Zak, his friend and former neighbor, and told him what he had learned earlier that day from the FDA staff. Minutes later, Zak, who, prior to April 13 had maintained a 5,000 share long position in Connetics, began executing transactions that positioned him to benefit from a drop in Connetics' share price.   The Amended Complaint further alleges that between April 13 and June 10, Yaroshinsky and Zak executed numerous trades. Yaroshinsky purchased put contracts in his own account and in a nominee account opened in the name of his mother-in-law and sold shares of Connetics common stock in his own account. Zak purchased put contracts, sold short Connetics shares, and sold his long position of Connetics shares. All of the trading by defendants was conducted in advance of a June 13, 2005 public announcement by Connetics stating that it had received a ""not approvable"" letter from the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") concerning Velac Gel. After the announcement, Connetics' stock price fell 27%. Specifically, the Amended Complaint alleges that Yaroshinsky and Zak violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other relief, the Amended Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of all illegal profits, prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.   The Commission expresses its appreciation to the Chicago Board Options Exchange for its assistance in the investigation of this matter.

Tomasek and Patrick Giordano, with conducting a fraudulent and deceptive scheme to disguise public stock sales by corporate affiliates that should have been registered with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1).  According to the complaint the scheme involved the issuance of stock to nominee shareholders and the filing of a Form S-1 registration statement, ostensibly to allow the nominees to sell their BMP stock for public sale on the OTC market without being required by the registration provisions. The complaint also alleges the receipt of attorney opinion letters falsely stated that each nominee was a ""controlled person"" and that all nominees were ""own persons.""  Without admitting or denying the allegations, all three defendants consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by a court at a later date.Â The SECâs complaint charges the following defendants with violations of Sections 5(c), 5 (a), and 17 (b)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section10(d) or Section 15(e) the Exchange Act and Rules 15e-14, 16a-13 and 16b2-2, among other provisions: (1) a temporary restraining order against the defendant defendants; and 2) an officer and director bar against each defendant for aiding and abetting each of these violations. In addition, as part of this conduct, Sargeent and Giordanano were ordered to surrender to PixarBio or its transfer agent or to provide an opinion letter to any person or entity in connection with their issuance or sale of any restricted shares of Pixar Bio stock. These orders also require that defendants surrender their stock certificates and pay a civil penalty of $1,680, which is equal to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, plus a $50,000 penalty, for a period of five years. Finally, in a parallel criminal proceeding","On September 14, 2020, the U.S. District Court in Boston entered a final judgment against New York residents Frederick Mintz and Alan Fraade, whom the SEC charged with involvement in a scheme that used nominee shareholders to fraudulently register microcap company securities for public sale.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint against five individuals filed in June 2019, co-defendant Henry Sargent created BMP Holdings Inc. and issued BMP shares to friends, family, and co-workers for the purpose of creating free-trading shares to be sold later on public markets.  Mintz and Fraade, who were licensed lawyers at that time, prepared false attorney opinion letters to help Sargent and others facilitate the merger of BMP into PixarBio Corporation, a private company that the SEC previously charged, along with three other individuals, in a separate action.  Mintz and Fraade consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The judgment further prohibits Mintz and Fraade from providing legal services pertaining to federal securities law exemptions from registration. Mintz and Fraade have consented to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest for a total of $28,785.96.  No civil penalty was imposed against Mintz and Fraade based on their financial condition.  In related administrative proceedings, the SEC yesterday issued orders permanently suspending Mintz and Fraade from appearing and practicing before the SEC as attorneys.",0.456,0.5317

The complaint further alleges that, contrary to representations made to the investing public and in press releases and public filings, Patton and West transferred the bulk of the proceeds to entities controlled by the Alversons, and then sold the shares back to those entities without a registration statement in effect. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all three defendants agreed to settle the charges against them and pay disgorgement and penalties of $4 million and prejudgment interest in amounts to be determined at a later date. Under the settlement, which is subject to court approval, defendants consented to permanent injunctions and penny stock bars, to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties and to pay a $25,000 civil penalty in connection with the alleged violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as a civil injunctive action in which Patton was also charged with aiding and abetting the violations and, in a parallel action, was ordered to cease and desist from violating the registration provisions of Sections 5, 5 and 17 (a). The Commission also instituted an administrative cease-and-desist and an asset freeze against Patton, who was subsequently convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to six months imprisonment and ordered by a federal judge to surrender his passport. Patton is charged in this matter with violating Section 15(d) by virtue of his role as an officer and director of a publicly-traded company. He has agreed, without admitting to any wrongdoing or causing any harm to others, not to violate the antifraud provisions contained in Section 20(e) the federal securities laws, including Section 13(j) under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Sections 10 (b), 13 (d)(2)(A), and 14(c) in violation","On June 8, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint charging Curative Biosciences, Inc. f/k/a Healthient, Inc. and corporate insiders with fraudulently misrepresenting that the company had issued company shares to third parties in purported compensation for services and in discharge of company debt when, in fact, the company issued the shares for capital raising purposes in violation of the offering registration requirements.

In its action, the Commission accuses C-Tech and Schlotterbeck of securities fraud in connection with the offer and sale of interests in two oil and gas wells near Beeville, Texas.  Schlotterbeck diverted more than $500,000 of the $2.8 million raised in the first offering for his personal use, leaving the well unfinished.  In the second offering, the well was never started and C-Tech lost the lease when Schlotterbeck misappropriated more than $450,000 of the $1.1 million raised.  It appears that, among other personal uses of investor funds, Schlotterbeck used $311,000 for the purchase of a luxury golf course lot in the Austin area.  In the course of offering and selling these interests, C-Tech and its sales staff have engaged in other misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the probability of drilling a successful well, the anticipated returns to investors, and the compensation paid to the C-Tech sales staff.  The Commission has charged the following defendants in its action:       Defendant C-Tech is a limited liability partnership organized in Texas with its principal place of business in Comanche, Texas.  C-Tech was originally founded in 1988 by Schlotterbeck and two other partners, for the purpose of obtaining production prospects and engaging in exploration, development and drilling activities.  The company was reorganized as a limited liability partnership in 2000 for the purpose of pursuing the development of medium depth wells in the Beeville, Texas area.   Defendant Robert W. Schlotterbeck is a resident of Round Rock, Texas and a co-founder and Managing Partner for C-Tech.  As Managing Partner of C-Tech, Schlotterbeck controls the financial affairs of C-Tech and is a signatory on all bank accounts.  In addition, Schlotterbeck established a sole proprietorship known as Millennium Lead Source (&quot;Millennium&quot;) to market C-Tech's oil and gas interests through &quot;cold calls&quot; to potential investors.  The Commission's complaint charges C-Tech and Schlotterbeck with violating the antifraud provisions found in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks an immediate asset freeze, preliminary and permanent injunctions, an interim accounting, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty against each defendant, as well as the appointment of a receiver over the assets of the defendants.  Finally, the Commission also seeks an order prohibiting the movement, alteration and destruction of books and records, and expedited discovery - all of which were granted by the Court today.     &nbsp;SEC Complaint in this matter.",0.5174,0.3467
43,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Jeffrey C. Mack, the former Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of the Board of Digiliti Money Group, Inc., a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based financial technology company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, alleges that between September 2016 and July 2017, Mack and Blaney engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the company's revenue by causing it to improperly recognize $1.65 million of revenue from the four contracts, even though the customer could cancel the contracts without paying the issuer any money. The complaint further alleges Mack was the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Sales and that he signed each of these filings and falsely certified that the filings were not false or misleads. According to the SEC, in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Digiti overstated its revenues by more than 17% and its first-quarter financial results by over 24%.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, each defendant consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and the registration provision of Sections 13(j)(1), 12b2-1, 13a-11 and 13A-13, as well as aiding and abetting the Company's violations of those provisions. In a parallel action, a U.S. District Court Judge entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets and prohibiting them from participating in any offering of any security, prohibiting the destruction of documents; imposing a civil monetary penalty against Mack; ordering the repatriation of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon; granting expedited discovery; barring Mack from serving as an officer or director of an SEC-registered company; requiring the payment of disgorgement of $100,000 to a relief defendant; prohibiting Mack to pay an $80,500 civil penalty and ordering him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of certain federal securities laws, including Section 15(1) or 10Â A.b.a.

According to the SEC's complaint, between September 2016 and July 2017, Jeffrey C. Mack, Digiliti's then CEO, and Lawrence C. Blaney, Digiliti's then VP of Sales, induced Digiliti's largest customer into signing sales contracts worth more than $1.8 million by covertly entering into a series of undisclosed side letters with favorable terms for the customer.  The side letters allegedly gave the customer an unconditional right to cancel the contracts in the future, a contractual term which would preclude revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"").  However, according to the complaint, Mack and Blaney concealed the side letters from Digiliti's finance and accounting personnel, Board of Directors, and external auditor and, as a result, Digiliti improperly recognized revenue on the sales in its financial statements for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.  During this same period, Digiliti raised more than $18 million from investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Minnesota, charges Mack and Blaney with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, the books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Digiliti's uncharged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records and reporting provisions of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Securities and Exchange Commission v. R. Geoffrey Layne, James S. Sholeff, Dale Boeth, and Shawn McGhee, Civil Action No.: C.A. 3:01-CV-1179 (E.D. Washington, D.C.)  SEC Charges Four Former Officers and Employees of PurchasePro.com, Inc. With Fraudulent Scheme   The Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against three former officers and employees of the Las Vegas-based Internet business-to-business electronic-commerce software company, Pro-After Inc., for their roles in a scheme to fraudulently inflate the announced and reported revenues at the company. According to the Commission's complaint, the scheme began in April 2001, when the then-senior vice president of marketing and sales at Purchasepro, who was then a Senior Vice President of Consulting Services, agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) or (3) the books and records, internal accounting controls, books-and-records and internal auditors provisions. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws in connection with the sale of two marketplace license sales by Purchase Pro to a company called Bigstep Inc.; a $3.5 million market place license sale to an entity called Garg Data International Inc; and a ""Statement of Work"" contract between the two entities. In addition, it alleges, in particular, that each of these transactions had a misleading impact on the revenues reported by the Company. For each defendant, this misleading effect was quantitatively material, either to, or directly caused by, material non-compliance with, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as, (i) a materially false and misleading quarterly earnings release; (ii) an improper recognition of revenue from the marketplace sales; or, as a result, a material misappropriation of material information by one or more defendants.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 18999 / December 15 2004  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2152 / December 15, 2004  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

FOUR FORMER PURCHASEPRO EXECUTIVES SETTLE FINANCIAL FRAUD CASE WITH SEC THE FORMER PURCHASEPRO EXECUTIVES ALSO AGREE TO ENTER GUILTY PLEAS TO RELATED FEDERAL CRIMINAL CHARGES  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against four former executives of PurchasePro.com, Inc. for violations of the antifraud, books-and-records, internal accounting controls, periodic reporting and lying-to-auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.   According to the complaint, the defendants-R. Geoffrey Layne, James S. Sholeff, Dale Boeth, and Shawn McGhee-participated in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the first quarter 2001 (""Q1 2001"") revenues of PurchasePro.com, Inc., a Las Vegas-based Internet company now known as Pro-After, Inc.  All four individuals, who were officers or senior employees of PurchasePro, settled the charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations. The Commission's complaint alleges that in Q1 2001 and continuing through April 2001, each defendant took knowing and deliberate steps designed to inflate PurchasePro's revenues in contravention of generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"").  In particular, the complaint alleges that, Layne, while serving as PurchasePro's Executive Vice President, (i) entered into, and concealed the existence of, reciprocal agreements that rendered it improper to recognize $1 million in revenue from two marketplace license sales to PurchasePro customers; and (ii) took steps to make it falsely appear that a purported ""Statement of Work"" contract between PurchasePro and AOL, valued at $3.65 million, was executed during Q1 2001, when in fact it was never properly executed.  The complaint further alleges that Boeth, PurchasePro's Senior Vice President of Consulting Services, and Sholeff, a PurchasePro Vice President, also took steps to make it falsely appear that the Statement of Work agreement was executed during Q1 2001, and that Sholeff took similar steps with respect to a $3.7 million marketplace license sale.  According to the complaint, McGhee, PurchasePro's Chief Operating Officer during the relevant period, took steps to (i) make it falsely appear that a $3.5 million marketplace license sale had been entered into during Q1 2001; and (ii) conceal the existence of reciprocal agreements that rendered it improper to recognize any revenue from that sale.  Each of these transactions had a misleading impact on the revenues announced and reported by PurchasePro.  As reflected in the complaint, by including these transactions, PurchasePro artificially and materially inflated its publicly announced revenues by at least 34% and its reported revenues by over 37%.     In addition, the complaint alleges that, during April 2001, Layne and Sholeff attempted to conceal their conduct by destroying certain documents.  In particular, the complaint alleges that Sholeff and Layne deleted, or requested others to delete, their AOL-related emails, and that Sholeff shredded all of his AOL related documents and destroyed his laptop.  The complaint further alleges that in February 2002, Layne and Sholeff lied to the Commission staff during testimony in order to conceal their fraudulent conduct.  Finally, the complaint alleges that in April 2001, PurchasePro paid Layne a $200,000 retention bonus and that at or about the same time, PurchasePro paid Boeth a total of $150,000 in retention bonuses.  Based on these factual allegations, the Commission charged: (i) Layne and McGhee with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and with aiding and abetting PurchasePro's violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13; (ii) Sholeff with violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting PurchasePro's violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13; and (iii) Boeth with violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, each defendant consented to final judgments that would permanently enjoin each of them from violating the foregoing securities law provisions, and that would: (i) in the case of Layne, permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and order Layne to pay disgorgement of $200,000 plus prejudgment interest; (ii) in the case of Sholeff, permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and order Sholeff to pay a $35,000 civil penalty; (iii) in the case of Boeth, permanently bar him from acting as an officer or director of any public company, and order Boeth to pay disgorgement of $150,000 plus prejudgment interest, but waive payment, and not impose a civil penalty, based on Boeth's demonstrated inability to pay; and (iv) in the case of McGhee, bar him for five years from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  The final judgment against Layne permits him to offset his payment of disgorgement by the corresponding amount of any restitution he pays in connection with the parallel criminal proceeding described below; while the final judgment against Sholeff permits him to offset his payment of civil penalties by the corresponding amount of any criminal fine he pays in connection with that same parallel criminal proceeding.  The final judgments are subject to the approval of the United States District Court.    Also today, in a related criminal proceeding, the United States Attorneys' office for the Eastern District of Virginia announced that Layne, McGhee, Boeth and Sholeff have each agreed to plead guilty to single felony counts arising from the same circumstances as the Commission's complaint.  In particular, Layne will plead to a single felony count of securities fraud; McGhee and Boeth will each plead to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud; and Sholeff will plead to a single felony count of perjury arising from false statements that Sholeff made to the SEC staff during the investigation.

45,"On December 11, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Westport Capital Markets, LLC and its CEO, Christopher E. McClure, with defrauding their advisory clients, and failing to disclose their financial conflicts of interest.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, from March 2012 to June 2015, WESTPORT and McClURE received undisclosed mark-ups and fees for themselves when they sold securities from their own brokerage accounts to client accounts. The SEC alleges that the securities were risky and resulted in substantial losses for clients. In some instances, clients invested in mutual fund share classes that charged a 12b-1 fee, even when a share class of the same fund was available without a fee. As a result, investors were deprived of key information they needed to evaluate the clients' financial motives in investing these risky securities in their accounts, including at least one client who had been told she would not want to invest her funds in those shares. WestPORT, which is a registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, agreed to pay a total of over $780,000 in undisclosed fees and to cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b) and 14(e) the Investment Advisers Act and Rules 10b 5 and 13e 5 thereunder, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $80,500 and an officer-and-director bar in the form of a penny stock bar.

Specifically, West","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut-based investment advisory firm and its principal with breaching their fiduciary duties and defrauding advisory clients, including by repeatedly purchasing securities that generated significant amounts of undisclosed compensation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that Westport Capital Markets, LLC, a dually registered investment adviser and broker-dealer, and Westport's principal, Christopher E. McClure, repeatedly invested advisory clients' funds in risky securities that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed mark-ups for Westport and resulted in more than $1 million in losses for clients.  According to the complaint, Westport for several years purchased securities from underwriters at a discount to the public offering price and then, acting as a principal for its own account, re-sold those same securities to its advisory clients at higher prices without disclosing the mark-up.  Westport and McClure sometimes held the securities in client accounts for only a short period of time before re-selling the securities and then investing client funds in another offering with a mark-up.  The complaint further alleges that Westport and McClure defrauded a client by acting contrary to the client's express objectives and instead repeatedly investing the client in risky offerings that generated hidden mark-ups.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Westport and McClure made false and misleading representations to clients regarding the compensation that Westport would receive from their accounts.  The complaint further alleges that Westport, in its capacity as a broker-dealer, received undisclosed mutual fund distribution fees, known as 12b-1 fees, when Westport and McClure invested advisory clients in certain mutual fund share classes.  Westport and McClure allegedly did not disclose to clients the conflict of interest that this created.  According to the complaint, in certain instances, Westport and McClure invested clients in mutual fund shares with 12b-1 fees even when cheaper shares of the same funds were available without 12b-1 fees.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Westport's advisory clients paid approximately $780,000 in undisclosed mark-ups and fees on top of the advisory fees they paid the firm.  The SEC's complaint charges Westport with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(3), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act and charges McClure with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act and with aiding and abetting Westport's violation of Section 206(3).

Couch, with conducting a fraudulent scheme to raise approximately $9.800,000 from more than 200 investors in 21 states.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least September 2010 through January 2012, Couch and COG, through various means, carried on a scheme and made materially false and misleading statements and omissions to potential and actual investors to make unregistered offers and sales of securities in two of Couch's oil-and-gas investments programs: the Permian-Black Shale-Fifty Nine Well Program and the Ra dial Nine Program (radial nine wells).  The complaint alleges that Couch claimed that investor funds would be used to drill, complete, and complete wells in the Programs, falsely represented that investors would receive working interests in each program; and failed to tell investors that approximately 30% of the funds raised from investors were paid as sales commissions, or for the interests they would acquire in other programs, as well as that the investments were not registered with the Commission or any state. The SEC further alleges Couch misled investors about the nature of his business, its historical experience and success, anticipated well production, costs associated with drilling, completion, geologic matters, marketing and other services provided by the programs and misrepresented the use of investor proceeds in both programs. In addition, defendants allegedly misled potential investors regarding a decision to wind down the Radial Nine program early, which they did not disclose until after Couch decided to stop selling the program in October 2011, when he decided not to sell it at that time and instead stopped selling it in early 2012. As a result of this conduct, investors lost over $2.5 million of their money and were unable to afford the promised returns. To cover expenses unrelated to these investments, they allegedly transferred $3.3 million to a brokerage firm they controlled and used the money for unrelated business expenses, including a workover drilling rig for a boiler room at the company's unrelated Texas oil field operations business. They also allegedly misappropriated $1.2 million in investor money to pay for undisclosed and often unrelated expenses in connection with other offerings, such as payroll and tax liabilitements, credit card payments and overhead, none of which was disclosed in offering documents or PPMs, nor in any offering materials provided to investors.

The Commission's complaint alleges that offering documents prepared and distributed by the defendants falsely claimed that investors would receive working interests in oil and gas wells when, in fact, Couch and Couch Oil &amp; Gas retained those working interests and never transferred them to investors. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely represented to investors that most or all of their funds would be used to drill and complete the wells and failed to inform them that, among other undisclosed expenses, approximately 30% of their funds would be used to make sales commission payments to unregistered brokers. The complaint further alleges that the defendants made unsubstantiated and highly inflated projections concerning potential oil and gas production from the wells and falsely portrayed to investors that defendants were experienced and successful at radial jet drilling technology.

(JSR)   The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against David B. Schlegel, a licensed attorney and the managing partner of the Washington, DC office of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP (""KMR""), for engaging in unlawful insider trading. The Commission's complaint alleges that, on November 5, 2004, while working as an attorney for a law firm, David C. ""Schwinger"" engaged in trading in advance of a merger with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (""JPM"") in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his firm.  According to the complaint, the merger was first publicly announced in January 2005 when Vastera, Inc. issued a press release before the market opened stating that JPM would be acquired for $3.50 per share. On the day after the release, Vasta's share price, which had closed at $2.00 on January 6, rose 50% to $4.75 a share on approximately four-times the historical average daily trading volume. By trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information and his belief that the acquisition was imminent, Schwingers had imputed illicit profits of $13,027.01.

Office  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against David A. Schwinger, an attorney and former managing partner of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP's (KMR) Washington, D.C. office.  Schwinger was charged with engaging in illegal insider trading by purchasing shares of Vastera, Inc. (Vastera), a Virginia-based company assisting businesses in tracking information about international shipments, in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, Schwinger has agreed to settle this matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment against him which imposes injunctive and monetary relief.  The complaint alleges that Schwinger purchased Vastera common stock on November 5, 2004, on the basis of material, nonpublic information that an acquisition of Vastera was imminent.  The complaint further alleges that Schwinger learned of the impending merger while interviewing Vastera's Chief Counsel, who was then seeking to be hired by KMR as a partner.  In responding to Schwinger's inquiries during the interview process about the Chief Counsel's reasons for leaving Vastera, the Chief Counsel allegedly disclosed to Schwinger no later than October 27, 2004 that Vastera's acquisition was imminent.  On the basis of that material, nonpublic information, the complaint alleges that Schwinger purchased 10,000 shares of Vastera common stock on November 5, 2004 at an average price of $1.70 per share.  The complaint further alleges that Schwinger knew that Vastera was a KMR client at the time of the purchase.  According to the complaint, Vastera announced on January 7, 2005 that it was being acquired by JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.  Vastera's share price, which had closed at $2.00 on January 6, rose 50% to $3 a share by the close of the market on January 7 on approximately four times the historical average daily trading volume.  The complaint alleges that Schwinger knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he purchased Vastera shares based on material, nonpublic information obtained during the interview process and in breach of a fiduciary duty owed to his firm, KMR.  Schwinger is alleged to have imputed profits of $13,027.  Based on the facts alleged, the Commission charged Schwinger with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Schwinger has consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (i) permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) requires him to disgorge $13,027 in illicit gains and $1,940 in prejudgment interest thereon; and (iii) orders him to pay a civil penalty of $26,054.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that Ikenna Ikokwu of Cumming, Georgia, and two companies he controlled, Winning the Money Game With Ike, Inc. and Money LLC, raised approximately $5 million from more than twenty of his clients, many of whom were members of a family that invested in FutureGen Company, which was run by a man named Lawrence Schmidt. According to the SEC, while operating the investment advisory business and advising clients on behalf of the firm, Schmidt siphoned off almost $2 million of investors' money for his own benefit and used new investor money to pay off earlier investors. In April 2014, after Schmidt fled the country, he allegedly engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by falsely representing himself as an objective and independent investment advisor and telling them that he had earned substantial kickbacks from Schmidt for persuading clients to invest. The complaint also alleges the defendants lied to investors and told them he conducted substantial due diligence into the company prior to recommending the investments, realizing over $60,000 in undisclosed commissions from the scheme. As a result of their conduct, Ikenna and the entities charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act Section 10(d) (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10d-1, 12b2-2, 13a-14, 14b5-11, 16b3-8, 17b1-3, 18b4-13, 15b6-17, or 16e-20, in violation of Section 13(e)(2)(A) a/k/a the ""Pump and Dump"" provision of Rule 13d2. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC enforcement action, defendants have consented to permanent injunctions prohibiting them from soliciting or selling any investments and from participating in any offering of any security, offering or sale of securities for a period of five years, from committing or causing any violations of these provisions, including Section 17","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against an investment adviser who recommended a Ponzi-like tax lien investment scheme to his clients.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Ikenna Ikokwu, a resident of Cumming, Georgia, persuaded over 20 clients of his companies Winning the Money Game with Ike, Inc. (""WMGI"") and Winning the Money Game, LLC (""WMG""), to collectively invest $5 million in securities issued by FutureGen Company, a company that, along with its principal, Lawrence P. Schmidt, was previously charged by the SEC with defrauding investors across the country in an investment scheme involving unregistered debt offerings.  In exchange for persuading clients to invest in FutureGen, Ikokwu received undisclosed ""kickbacks"" of over $100,000 from FutureGen.  Ikokwu allegedly told his clients that he did not receive compensation from any third party for providing investment advice but did not disclose the FutureGen kickbacks.  He also allegedly told investors that he had conducted extensive due diligence into FutureGen prior to making his recommendation, when he actually did little or no research on the company.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Ikokwu touted the performance of his own family's investments with Schmidt to clients when the largest of those investments was actually in default.  The SEC's complaint charges Ikokwu and his companies, WMGI and WMG, with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule l0b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In addition, the complaint charges Ikokwu and WMGI with violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jack Easton, Dustin Ruta, and Kingdon Kase of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and was supervised by G. Jeffrey Boujoukos.

SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA RESIDENT FOR FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME   On September 27, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against a recidivist securities law violator who was the subject of a 1995 cease-and-desist order from the Pennsylvania Securities Commission. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from spring 2001 to September 2003, Harvey ""Tex,"" a resident of Munieta, Calif., sold approximately $2.3 million in unregistered investments in a wine grape venture known as ""Buy the Vine"" that consisted of four vineyards located in Temecula, California.  According to the complaint, Tex sold the securities to 50 investors nationwide by selling them purported ""general partnership"" interests in one or more of the wine grapes. Although documents distributed to and signed by investors purported to describe their investment as a general partnership, these documents did not contain any of these basic elements of an agreement, such as the structure and rights and voting powers of general partners, access to books and records, or the authority and accountability of any managing general partner. Tex also misappropriated $650,000 of investor funds for purposes unknown to investors, including to pay for his son's college tuition, travel, and loans to family members and friends. Without admitting or denying the allegations in Tex's Complaint, Texas-based Tex has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as to an order requiring Tex to cease and desist from future securities offerings and from participating in any future offering of securities.Tex also agreed to be enjoined from committing or causing any violation of Section 5 of  the federal securities laws and to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties totaling $1.5 million and $600,500, respectively, for a total of $3.2 million.Tabb has also entered into a settlement with the","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19392 / September 26, 2005  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Tabb, a repeat securities law violator who is the subject of a permanent injunction obtained by the Commission in 1995.  The Commission charged Tabb with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with his offering of interests in a wine grape venture in Temecula, California called ""Buy the Vine."" The complaint alleges that, between spring 2001 and September 2003, Tabb raised approximately $2.3 million for Buy the Vine from 50 investors nationwide by selling securities in the form of purported ""general partnership"" interests through general public solicitation.  According to the complaint, when selling the securities, Tabb misrepresented and omitted to disclose information relating to the projected returns on the grape vineyards, the funds needed to operate the venture, the ownership of the vineyard lands, and the business experience and disciplinary histories possessed by him and his son, who was touted as a manager of the venture.  The complaint also alleges that Tabb misappropriated investor funds for purposes undisclosed to investors. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Tabb consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from (1) violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and (2) participating in the sale of or offer to sell any security (including purported partnership interests) in an unregistered transaction.  Tabb also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  The final judgment is subject to court approval.

Chicago D&P, Inc., Patricia Morgen and Shalom Gibson, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case Number 4:04-CV-2586 (N.D. Cal.)  SEC OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF TO HALT $10 MILLION OFFERING FRAUD  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of two California-based real estate development companies and their principals.  According to the Commission&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in Oakland, the defendants have raised at least $11 million since January 2001 from more than 200 investors, many of whom were members of the investment community. The complaint alleges that defendants falsely told investors that their money would be used to fund Chicago-Door Real Estate Acquisitions, and that they would receive a rate of return of from 18% to 27% based on profits generated from the companyâs real-estate acquisition business. In reality, defendants raised approximately $6.4 million from new investors and paid more $3.2 million in so-called profits to existing investors. Additionally, Defendants diverted a significant portion of investor funds, several hundred thousand dollars over the last six months alone, into cash and personal expenses, including payments to clothing stores, spas and for other personal items. As a result of their conduct, they have violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) ofÂ the Securities Exchange and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, all defendants agreed to be enjoined from future violations of these provisions and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties of up to $1.5 million and $230,000, respectively, for their respective roles in connection with the alleged fraud and other conduct alleged in their offering materials.

CHICAGO D&amp;P, INC., PATRICIA MORGEN AND SHALOM GIBSON, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. c 04 1742  SEC FREEZES ASSETS IN BAY AREA PONZI SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an order freezing the assets of Chicago D&amp;P, Inc., a purported real estate company based in Emeryville, California (with offices in Reno, Nevada) that has raised millions of dollars from hundreds of investors nationwide since 2001 (including over $6 million in the last six months alone).  According to the Commission, the company lured investors into a fraudulent Ponzi scheme by guaranteeing profits of over 36% per year, and at times promising to double investors' money within a year.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Chicago D&amp;P fraudulently represented that it would use investor funds to acquire real estate that would generate ""safe"" and ""phenomenal"" returns.  Instead, the company's founder and president, 57-year-old Emeryville, California resident Patricia ""Pat"" Morgen, diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars to personal use.  According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants fooled investors into thinking the investment was profitable by making regular payments of supposed investment returns; in actuality, the money came from new investors.    An order issued by Judge Charles R. Breyer Tuesday morning freezes all funds and assets controlled by Chicago D&amp;P and Morgen, as well as those of Morgen's 27-year-old son Shalom Gibson, of Berkeley, California, who is alleged to have controlled various bank accounts into which Morgen siphoned investor funds.  The Commission reported to the court that, immediately after receiving subpoenas from the Commission over the weekend, Gibson and Morgen attempted to withdraw $300,000 of investors' funds in cash and cashier's checks, a move blocked by the court order.  Based on the evidence presented by the Commission, the Court issued an order temporarily freezing all of Chicago D&amp;P's, Morgen's, and Gibson's funds and providing other emergency relief. The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

51,"On August 20, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Francisco-based investment adviser Michael B. Rothenberg and his investment advisory firm, RVMC, with defrauding more than 200 investors through a scheme to misappropriate money from the funds they managed.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, from 2015 to 2017, Michael and ROTHENBERG created a front-loaded fee structure, which allowed them to charge investors a single-time management fee in excess of the amount of fees they invested. The SEC alleges that the scheme included numerous deceptive acts, including:  (i) taking fees from these funds; (ii) misappropriating over $1 million of investor money; and (iii) creating the false appearance that money was used for legitimate fund expenses or investments or had otherwise been paid back. Over the course of 2015, over a year-long period, Defendants engaged in increasingly frequent acts of concealment to hide their scheme from investors and to conceal their fraud. In addition, according to documents filed with the Commission, by April 2017 they had raised nearly $24.62 million from 62 investors, approximately half of which were non-US investors. As a result of their fraudulent scheme, investors were left with a loss of approximately $4.77 million, and the rest was spent on personal expenses, rent, meals, entertainment, jewelry, travel, sporting goods, home furnishings, a car racing team, an online store and an Amazon.com storefront. To cover up their misconduct, defendants allegedly used investor funds to pay for their own personal business ventures, such as the purchase of a large commercial building in SOMA, Calif., and for rent on an office space at a Silicon Valley-area technology company. On the basis of these deceptive actions, Rothensberg has been able to continue his scheme for years, even though his personal expenditures outpaced that of his venture capital funds and fund investors' income. He has agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 207(2) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 (4)-8 thereunder, as well as disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and a civil money penalty of $100,000, for a total payment of over one-million dollars.

According to SEC filings, Rothenberg's funds had nearly 200 investors and more than $64 million in assets. The SEC's complaint alleges that over a three-year period, Rothenberg and his firm misappropriated millions of dollars from the funds, including an estimated $7 million of excess fees, which Rothenberg used to support personal business ventures he claimed were self-funded and to pay for private parties and events at high-end resorts and Bay Area sporting arenas.  The SEC's complaint alleges Rothenberg and Rothenberg Ventures violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Rothenberg and Rothenberg Ventures agreed to settle the charges. The settlement is subject to approval by the federal district court for the Northern District of California which would determine the amount of disgorgement and civil money penalties.

THERIOT, Civil Action No.: 02-CV-1131 (S.D. Tex.) (Houston Division)  SEC CHARGES THREE COMPANY OFFICERS WITH FRAUD IN THE OFFERING OF FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES  The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, charging three individuals with fraudulently offering and selling unregistered securities in connection with the offer and sale of certain securities. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and the books and records provision of Sections 5(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act and Section 10(b) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement and civil penalties of $25,000 and $5,500, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date. In its complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas on July 27, the Honorable James E. Basinger, U. S. District Judge, entered a temporary restraining order against the three defendants, among other things, freezing their assets, imposing an officer-and-director bar against each of them and imposing a penny stock bar and a five-year bar prohibiting each defendant from participating in any offering of securities for a period of five years. As a result of their actions, defendants have been able to raise approximately $1.2 million from investors, who were told that their funds would be used to purchase, lease, operate, rent, or purchase the stock of a publicly-traded company. Investors were misled to believe their money was being used for legitimate business purposes when in fact the company's stock price was going up by more than $100 per share and that investors were losing money due to a series of misstatements and omissions by defendants in their brokerage account statements and in other SEC filings, including the issuance of","UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No.  17651 / August 1, 2002 Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1607 / August 1, 2002   Securities and Exchange Commission v. Douglas A. Murphy, David G. Kay and Lawrence H. Theriot, Civil Action No. H-02-2908 (S.D. Texas)  SEC SUES FORMER OFFICERS OF AMERICAN RICE, INC. FOR AUTHORIZING FOREIGN BRIBES  On July 30, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against two former officers of American Rice, Inc., Douglas A. Murphy and David G. Kay, alleging that they authorized over $500,000 in bribery payments to Haitian customs officials during 1998 and 1999, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  American Rice is a Houston, Texas based rice company.  The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Kay, with Murphy's knowledge, authorized the bribes to illegally reduce American Rice's import taxes by approximately $1.5 million.  According to the complaint, in advance of certain rice shipments to Haiti between January 1998 and October 1999, Kay directed an American Rice employee to prepare false shipping records that underreported the tonnage of rice on the relevant vessels.  Haitian customs officials used the false records to clear the American Rice vessels through customs.  After the vessels cleared customs, Kay allegedly directed American Rice employees in Haiti pay cash bribes to certain customs officials.  To hide the payments, Kay then directed American Rice's controller in Haiti to improperly record the bribery payments as routine business expenditures.  American Rice employees made at least 12 bribery payments totaling approximately $500,000.  In exchange, American Rice illegally avoided approximately $1.5 million in Haitian import taxes.  The complaint further alleges that Murphy was aware of the bribery scheme, but took no action to stop the payments.  A third individual, Lawrence H. Theriot, a former American Rice consultant, allegedly assisted  Kay and Murphy by monitoring the bribery scheme and exploring alternative arrangements.  The complaint alleges that Kay violated Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aided and abetted American Rice's violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, that Murphy violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act and is liable, as a controlling person, for Kay's violations of Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and that Theriot aided and abetted Kay and Murphy's violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act.  In parallel criminal proceedings, the Department of Justice previously obtained indictments against Murphy and Kay.  On April 16, 2002, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas dismissed the indictments on the grounds that the payments at issue were not made to obtain or retain business in Haiti, as required by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

(""Titan""), a Chicago, Illinois-based investment adviser, and Andrew Buie, Titan's owner and president. According to the SEC's complaint, while not registered with the Commission as broker, Hayden was not associated with any registered brokerage firm at the time of his alleged participation.  In fact, he was a convicted felon and was sentenced to 42 months in prison in November 2010 for his role in an alleged fraudulent offering of securities in which he received $450,000 in commissions from Titan and Titan, as well as from his own sales and solicitation activities.

TWO RECIVIDISTS CHARGED IN A REAL ESTATE FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 29, 2011, it charged two recidivists, Stephen Amella and Andre Hayden, residents of Illinois and Tennessee, respectively, with making misrepresentations to investors regarding investments in a purported real estate joint venture and for acting as unregistered brokers.  The Commission seeks, among other relief, conduct-based injunctions against the defendants, permanently enjoining them from soliciting existing or potential investors to purchase or sell securities.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Stephen Amella and Andre Hayden sold $450,000 in interests in a real estate joint venture on behalf of Titan Investment Partners Corp and its president, Andrew Buie, by making material misrepresentations about the joint venture and by failing to conduct due diligence on the joint venture.  The complaint alleges that Amella and Hayden represented that investments in the purported real estate joint venture would generate a guaranteed 10% monthly profit, and that the joint venture had already acquired some properties for which it needed investor funds to rehab and convert into condominiums for resale.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Amella and Hayden represented that investors&#8217; initial investments in the joint venture would be returned to them when the projects were completed.  The complaint adds that the joint venture did not acquire any real properties, and that Buie misappropriated the entire offering proceeds, spending it on his personal expenses and on commissions to Amella and Hayden.  The complaint states further that had Amella and Hayden conducted due diligence, they would have uncovered that prevailing market conditions rendered it highly improbable that the purported real estate project could generate sufficient revenue to guarantee that investors would recover 10% monthly profits, and that Buie did not acquire any real properties.  The complaint also alleges that Amella and Hayden sold the joint venture interests and received commissions for their selling activities without being registered with the Commission as brokers.  The defendants were previously charged by the Commission with participating in a fraudulent offering in which they misrepresented the use of proceeds, expected returns, and risks of the investment.  As part of that offering, defendants raised $1.3 million from twenty-seven investors to purportedly trade in foreign currency.  [see SEC v. Platinum Capital Advocates, Inc., et al., 07 C 0985 (N.D.

55,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Massachusetts-based real estate developer Donato J. Dandreo III with raising more than $1.5 million from investors in the public markets in 2016 and 2017.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, from 2016 to 2017, the developer offered investors promissory notes that contained a written promise that he would use the money raised to finance construction of residential homes on Boston's north shore. The SEC alleges that, instead of using the funds raised as promised, as he claimed, he used an internet investment platform to attempt to raise funds for his real-estate development company, Bounty Homes Corp., and promised investors that their money would be used for the construction and purchase of resale homes. In reality, however, Dâs promises were false and he did not use investor funds to build the homes, and instead relied on a private fundraising website he created to solicit investors to invest in deals.The SEC also charged a third-party fundraiser who claimed to be a successful fundraiser, but was ultimately unsuccessful in raising any money at all. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaints, all three defendants agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a)(3) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to their disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.Dandreou, who has no criminal history, was arrested in Massachusetts on June 29, 2018 and charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Massachusetts and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with the same conduct. He has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one of aiding and abetting violations of Section 20(d) and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14 and 13b2-1 thereunder. Both defendants have consented to permanent injunctions against future violations and to civil penalties against each of them based on their respective receipt of funds from the offering of securities.","On June 29, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Massachusetts real-estate developer with making several false statements in his attempts to raise funds from potential investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that, from 2016-2017, Donato J. Dandreo made several misrepresentations to potential investors in his attempts to finance construction of residential homes through his real-estate development company Bounty Homes Corporation.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Dandreo used an internet investment platform to attempt to raise funds.  The complaint also alleges that in an attempt to convey the appearance of being a successful fundraiser, Dandreo claimed that Bounty Homes was an ""opportunistic real estate investment company"" and had ""expert first-hand experience at every phase of the investment cycle.""  The complaint further alleges that Dandreo claimed to have raised almost $1.5 million from investors, despite having raised no money at all.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dandreo has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $9,239.

Page, United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division)   The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the U. S. district court for Dallas Division against Texas residents Shane M., of Dallas, Texas, Timothy Burt, of Austin, Tex., and Ryan R. Miller, a resident of Bonita Springs, Florida, for participating in a scheme to evade the registration requirements of the federal securities laws by offering and selling the securities of six companies to the public in violation of Rule 504 of Regulation D, 17 C.F.R. (1999). The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in an unregistered offer and sale of shares to six public companies in 2004 and 2005. The complaint also names as relief defendants, four individuals who are residents of Great Britain, two companies controlled by Miller family members and a former stock broker, as well as three entities controlled and controlled under Miller's ownership and control of Miller and Miller.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that, during 2004, defendants offered and sold the shares of these six publicly traded companies and, to a limited extent, induced their family, friends and others to purchase the stock and induce them to sell their own shares. In addition, it alleged, in some instances, that Miller was the company's sole managing member and that he personally pocketed $1 million in ill-gotten gains from the sales. Finally, on at least four occasions, Miller consented to be enjoined from violating Section 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15 (a)(l) of Securities Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $550,000, which Miller agreed to disgorge and pay civil penalties of up to $2.5 million.

Barham, Ballad Enterprises, Inc., and Bellatalia, L.P., Civil Action No. 3:07-cv-01643 (N.D. Tex.)    On September 26, 2007, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against six individuals and five entities, alleging that they engaged in a scheme to evade the registration requirements of the federal securities laws in connection with their sales of shares of six public companies. The complaint alleges that six companies purported to sell their stock to accredited investors in transactions exempt from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D. In fact, the complaint alleges, the accredited investors were underwriters who immediately resold their stock to the public without registering the transactions with the Commission, thereby precluding any exemption.  The complaint names as defendants Phillip W. Offill, Jr., of Dallas, Texas, and David Stocker, of Phoenix, Arizona, two attorneys who worked on the offerings. According to the complaint, Stocker directed the six companies to issue shares to six Texas entities which represented they were holding the shares for investment. However, five of the Texas entities were controlled by Offill, who immediately transferred the shares to Curtis-Case, Inc., a company controlled by Stocker. Stocker then sold the shares to the public. The complaint also names as defendants Texas residents, Shane A. Mullholand, Ryan M. Reynolds, and Timothy T. Page, who located companies that needed to raise capital. They introduced the companies to Stocker, and then acting through entities they controlled received and sold stock to the public to provide capital to the companies. The complaint alleges that these individuals kept profits from the sales far in excess of funds that they provided to the six companies. The complaint also alleges that Mullholand, Reynolds, Page, and their entities unlawfully acted as unregistered broker-dealers.  The complaint further alleges that Mullholand and Reynolds transferred some of their stock in three of the offerings to ATN Enterprises, LLC, a company owned by Steven P. Fischer, a Florida resident, who sold it to the public to raise funds for promotional campaigns for three of the companies and for his own personal profit. Fischer allegedly provided a portion of his profits to Timothy B. Barham as compensation for his introduction to Mullholand and Reynolds.  Offill, Stocker, Mullholand, Reynolds, Page, and Fischer are charged with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also charges the following entities with violating Sections 5(a) and (c): Curtis-Case, Inc. (controlled by Stocker); RSMR Capital Group, Inc. (controlled by Mullholand and Reynolds); Dissemination Services, L.L.C. (owned by Mullholand, and which provided funds to Reynolds); Page Properties, L.P. (controlled by Page), and ATN Enterprises, L.L.C. (controlled by Fischer). The complaint further charges Mullholand, Reynolds, Page, RSMR Capital Group, Dissemination Services, and Page Properties with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits persons from acting as brokers or dealers without registration with the Commission.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Offill, Stocker, Mullholand, Reynolds, Page, Fischer, and the entity defendants. The Commission also seeks an accounting and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from the stock sales, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, civil penalties, and bars from participating in penny stock offerings. Finally, the complaint names Barham, Ballad Enterprises, Inc. (controlled by Barham), and Bellatalia L.P. (controlled by Reynolds) as relief defendants, and seeks disgorgement from them of money that they received which can be traced to proceeds from unlawful stock sales.

The complaint also alleges that it failed to inform investors that there had been no merger with a third company. According to the complaint, as a result of this conduct, investors were misled to believe that the companies had successfully merged with another company, when, in fact, they had not merged at all, and that they were losing money. In addition, there was a significant amount of investor money that was being used to pay for personal expenses, such as car payments and rent on a home, credit cards, or other financial services.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Dominique S. Alvieri, a former New Jersey investment adviser, and Diversified Financial Corporation, a corporation that Alvieri controlled, with perpetrating an affinity fraud targeted at members of the ethnic Croatian community residing in northern New Jersey.  The Complaint alleges that, between December 1996 and March 1999, Alvieri fraudulently induced at least three of his advisory clients to purchase at least $555,800 worth of shares of either the Diversified Financial Fund or the Diversified Equity Fund, both of which Alvieri knew did not exist.  To induce additional investments in the Funds and conceal the fraud, Alvieri and Diversified engaged in further wrongdoing, including providing the clients with falsified monthly account statements that baselessly reported that the Funds were generating steady returns and telling at least one client that his investment was on deposit in a Financial Fund account at a broker-dealer that did not exist.    The Complaint further alleges that Alvieri misrepresented to his clients that he was the adviser to the Funds and that, through the Funds, he would invest his clients' assets in publicly traded securities.  In fact, Alvieri misappropriated his clients' monies and, after March 1999, fled the United States.  Named in the Complaint are:  Dominique S.

SEC Charges Maryland-Based Investment Adviser and His Firm for Conducting Fraudulent Offering Scheme   On February 2, 2009, the United States Securities Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Annapolis, Maryland, charging Maryland based investment adviser David Wehrrs, 54, and his firm, Mary Land Title &amp;Escrow. The Commission's complaint alleges that from at least July 2009 to the present, defendants fraudulently induced investors to invest in a $1.96 million FDIC-insured money market fund that promised to pay 10.85 percent interest per annum. As alleged in the complaint, Wealth Management Consultants, Inc. and its principal, Michael S. Fuchs, falsely told investors that the fund was affiliated with &#8220;American Funds&#8221; a mutual fund company. In fact, as alleged, American Funds was not registered with the Commission.  The Complaint further alleges, among other things, that defendants misrepresented to investors the nature of the investment and the use of investor funds. For example, Defendants falsely claimed that WealthManagement was a registered broker-dealer that would generate returns of 10 to 15 percent annually on the invested funds, when in fact Wealthmanagement was an entity that had no assets at all. Defendants also falsely represented to potential investors, for example through a false and misleading letterhead and false account statement, ""We will earn 10 percent annual return if you increase your investment."" In reality, according to one investor who provided the investor with a copy of her investment account statements, we knew this was false because the funds had been transferred from her federal retirement account to her bank account. Finally, We knew that she was receiving a Ponzi-like payment if she continued to trade the investments, which she did not intend to do.

Wehrs resides and MTE is headquartered in Annapolis, MD. The SEC also submitted for the Court's consideration a proposed settlement.Simultaneous with the filing of the SEC action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland filed a criminal information charging Wehrs with wire fraud arising out of the same conduct that is the subject of the Commission's Complaint.The SEC's Complaint alleges that through at least July 2009, Wehrs acted as an investment adviser and fraudulently induced at least 13 investors to provide him with at least $1.96 million for investment into a purported FDIC-insured money market fund that Wehrs ""guaranteed"" would pay 10.85 percent interest annually. The SEC alleges that, at times, Wehrs also represented to potential investors that the investment he offered was affiliated with ""American Funds,"" the mutual fund company. In fact, these representations were false.Instead, according to the Commission's Complaint, Wehrs misappropriated and used the investment principal for personal and business reasons, including: (1) to day trade funds in a brokerage account in the name of his business, MTE; (2) to support his home improvement company, Show-Me, Inc. (3) to make escrow payments for his title company; (4) to buy real estate and personal property; (5) to vacation in the British Virgin Islands; and (6) to make Ponzi-like payments to investors.The SEC Complaint further alleges that to conceal his fraudulent scheme, Wehrs fabricated and issued account statements to investors on his businesses' letterhead purporting to show investors' balances in their ""accounts"" and the interest gained on their ""investments."" The scheme appears to have depleted substantially all of the investors' monies.The Complaint alleges that Wehrs and MTE violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint also alleges that Wehrs and MTE violated Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Wehrs consented to entry of a permanent injunction from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

According to the SEC's complaint, in reality, investor funds were used to pay returns to earlier investors and for other purposes, such as to repay investors who had invested their retirement funds in a company that did not exist. The complaint alleges that the investment advisory firm that provided the advisory services was not registered at the time of the alleged scheme, and that investor money was instead used for personal expenses, including rent payments on a home, car, office, or other personal residence.

The SEC filed its complaint under seal on May 11, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  Advance fee frauds solicit investors to make upfront payments before purported deals can go through, and perpetrators fool investors with official-sounding terminology to add an air of legitimacy to the investment programs.  According to the SEC's complaint, which the Court unsealed yesterday at the SEC's request, Thomas G. Ellis and Yasuo Oda, through their company, North Star Finance LLC, and Michael K. Martin and Sharon L. Salinas, through their companies, Capital Source Lending LLC and Capital Source Funding LLC, have collected approximately $5 million from defrauded investors since at least January 2013.  The SEC alleges that North Star and the Capital Source entities promised investors that, for an advance fee that would be safely held in escrow accounts and used only for transactional expenses, they could ""monetize"" bank guarantees to generate millions of dollars.  North Star and Capital Source promised that this windfall could then be made available to investors in the form of project funding on highly favorable terms.  The SEC alleges that the bank guarantees that served as the backbone of North Star's and Capital Source's programs were a fiction, and underscores that several government agencies have warned investors away from transactions involving such instruments.  Even if these bank guarantees did exist, the SEC alleges, they could never be ""monetized"" as there is no formal or informal market on which they might be bought or sold.  The SEC alleges that, with the assistance of Thomas H. Vetter, a trusted member of the NAHB community, Ellis first pitched North Star's scheme at an annual meeting of the NAHB in February 2014, managing to convince multiple building concerns to sign up.  Thereafter, Ellis, Vetter, and Martin allegedly repeatedly lied to investors about the existence of the supposed bank instrument investments and the use of investor funds.  Ellis and Oda sent several emails in which they pressured investors to sign phony documents, on the false pretenses that the investment program was both legitimate and available for only a limited time.  Martin falsely told one of these investors that he had personally been involved in seven other transactions in 2014 in which he had ""secured"" and ""monetized"" bank guarantees.  Salinas participated in and aided and abetted the scheme by establishing bank accounts for Capital Source Funding, by falsely representing herself to be an escrow officer, and by signing at least one document that fraudulently purported to be an escrow agreement for the safekeeping of investor funds.  The SEC further alleges that, more than a year after signing up their first investors from the NAHB, the defendants have yet to produce any funding.  During this time, Martin, Ellis, Oda, and Vetter have lulled investors by giving them a string of phony updates promising funding was just around the corner; blaming delays on fictitious bank processes; and admonishing those investors who asked detailed questions about the status of their investments.  Instead of using investor funds to secure the promised bank instruments and subsequent funding, the defendants converted the funds for their own personal use or unlawfully transferred the funds to third parties.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2013 through the present, Michael J. Birkenheier and his company, BIO Capital Management, LLC, raised approximately $600,000 from investors by falsely claiming that the firm had a track record of providing investment advisory services and that its clients were members of the investment community. The complaint alleges, however, that these representations were false and misleading because, in fact, they were not.Â  According to the complaint filed against him by the SEC and obtained in a parallel criminal action, he repeatedly misled investors about the safety and performance of his investment, including by failing to disclose that he had been suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an investment advisor for a period of five years. In addition, according to one SEC filing, since the company was not registered as a broker-dealer at the time of filing its registration statement, it has violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted the violations of Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4) in connection with the issuance and sale of unregistered promissory notes and an offering of securities in violation of Rule 204(4)-1 thereon. Without admitting or denying the allegations, which were unsealed on May 20, 2018, Judge B. David Fraser has issued a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against the defendants, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a penny stock bar against each defendant, with a right to reapply for reappointment at a later date, subject to court approval, pursuant to which the court will determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction against further violations or a permanent officer-and-director bar, based on the defendant's financial statements.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against a Virginia-based mechanical engineer accused of scheming to manipulate the price of Fitbit stock by making a phony regulatory filing.  According to the SEC's complaint, Robert W. Murray purchased Fitbit call options just minutes before a fake tender offer that he orchestrated was filed on the SEC's EDGAR system purporting that a company named ABM Capital LTD sought to acquire Fitbit's outstanding shares at a substantial premium.  Fitbit's stock price temporarily spiked when the tender offer became publicly available on Nov. 10, 2016, and Murray sold all of his options for a profit of approximately $3,100.  The SEC alleges that Murray created an email account under the name of someone he found on the internet, and the email account was used to gain access to the EDGAR system.  Murray then allegedly listed that person as the CFO of ABM Capital and used a business address associated with that person in the fake filing.  The SEC also alleges that Murray attempted to conceal his identity and actual location at the time of the filing after conducting research into prior SEC cases that highlighted the IP addresses the false filers used to submit forms on EDGAR.  According to the SEC's complaint, it appeared as though the system was being accessed from a different state by using an IP address registered to a company located in Napa, California.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Murray.  The SEC's complaint charges Murray with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-8.

SEC CHARGES FORMER FINANCIAL ADVISER WITH FRAUDULENT SCHEME  On JanuaryÂ 28 March 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, charging a former financial adviser with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to defraud two clients out of approximately $6.5 million.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from approximately late summer of 2007 to the present, defendants, acting as investment advisers, have offered and sold fictitious securities to two of their clients, falsely claiming to have invested them in securities that did not exist. The complaint further alleges the defendants falsely claimed that they had access to debt guaranteed by the U. S. government through the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (""TARP"") and falsely represented that their funds were invested in ""Private Placements"" that were not in fact real. In fact, no such private Placement existed, and defendants had the ability to invest client funds in government-guaranteed commercial paper and bank debt as part of the TARP program. Moreover, Defendants falsely told the NC Client and the CA Client that these private placements had been purchased by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, when in reality they did invest their money in Treasury bonds and other government debt. Finally, they allegedly failed to disclose the fact that the private placement investments were fictitious and that Defendants had no business relationships with the nation's top investment firms. As a result, their scheme was a complete and unprofitable one, with no legitimate basis for existence, for which they were permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the broker-dealer registration provisions.

The Complaint further alleges that Grigg is a purported financial planner and an investment adviser who controls ProTrust.  From approximately 2007 to the present, according to the Complaint, Grigg and ProTrust defrauded at least 27 clients out of approximately $6.5 million by obtaining such funds from them and claiming to have invested them in securities that do not exist.

Timothy J. Huff and Thomas Y. Jimenez (United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division)  SEC CHARGES FORMER CEO OF GLOBETEL COMMUNICATIONS CORP. WITH FRAUDULENT INFLATING RECORDS  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Commission"") today charged a former chief executive officer of GlobeTel Communications, Corp. (GlobeTel), with fraudulently inflating the company's revenues from the third quarter of 2002 through the end of 2004.  According to the Commission's complaint filed in federal court in Miami, the former Chief Executive Officer of Globe Tel was assisted in the creation of phony fax records (CDRs) to disguise the existence of transactions between Globe Tel's telecom subsidiaries in Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines. The fake records were created by ThomasY.Jimenez at the direction of Huff, who was the chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Globetel, and created fake documents to conceal the fact that the purported transactions were actually fake. In fact, according to one SEC filing, none of the phony documents were ever produced. Instead, as a result of this misconduct, Globel reported materially false financial results for at least the period from which it had reported its first reported quarterly income in March 2002 to April 2004, when it reported a loss of $1.6 million in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. To settle the SEC's charges, Huff consented to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.

Huff (""Huff""), the former chief executive officer (""CEO"") of GlobeTel Communications Corp. (""GlobeTel"" or the ""company""), a publicly-traded company headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, now known as Sanswire Corp.  According to the complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Huff participated in a scheme to fraudulently inflate GlobeTel's revenue from approximately May 2002 through October 2004. The complaint alleges that Huff's scheme involved the creation of millions of dollars in fake invoices and call detail records that appeared to reflect transactions between GlobeTel and telecommunications companies in Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of Huff's scheme, GlobeTel issued materially false and misleading periodic reports, registration statements and press releases. Huff allegedly received compensation from the company of about $4.9 million and exercised stock options with a value of more than $1.5 million. The SEC charges Huff with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14 and 13b2-2 thereunder and seeks as relief permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and an officer and director bar.  The SEC previously charged GlobeTel and a number of other former officers in connection with these and other securities law violations. The SEC also charged Huff for violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Gabelli and Bruce Alpert, Civil Action Number: 06-CIV-2288 (SAS) (D.N.Y.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER GGGF FUND MANAGER AND BRUCE ALPERT WITH MARKET TIMING  The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Marc G., of Greenwich, Connecticut, authorized the fund to be market timed, or ""scalped,"" by Headstart Advisers Ltd. (""Headstart""), known during the relevant period as Folkes Asset Management.  According to the Commission's complaint, starting in April 2000, Marc Gabello authorized Head Start to significantly increase the amount of money it was using to market time GGBF in exchange for a ""sticky asset"" investment in a hedge fund he managed. The complaint alleges that, by approving the continuation of the market-timing arrangement, the Defendants knowingly or recklessly caused substantial harm to their mutual fund and the mutual funds they managed, including the loss of approximately $4.2 billion in assets and a $5 million loss in losses to shareholders in their hedge funds, and that the defendants knew or should have known this when they conducted their market timing transactions. In addition, they knew that they were not prohibited from trading in certain funds under the terms of a federal law that prohibited the use of market timers in any fund's investment portfolio.

From January 1, 2000 through June 30, 2002 the firm executed 863 trades or approximately 399 roundtrips, with an aggregate dollar value of about $6.3 billion.

Gabelli, the former portfolio manager of the Gabelli Global Growth Fund (GGGF), currently known as GAMCO Global Growth Fund, and Bruce Alpert, Chief Operating Officer of GGGF's adviser, Gabelli Funds LLC (Gabelli Funds), in connection with an undisclosed market timing arrangement with Folkes Asset Management, currently known as Headstart Advisers Ltd. (Headstart). ""Market timing"" refers to the practice of short term buying, selling, and exchanging of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  The Commission's Complaint, which seeks an injunction, civil penalties, disgorgement, and other relief, alleges as follows:   From September 1999 until August 2002, Marc Gabelli authorized Headstart to place market timing trades in GGGF. Beginning in April 2000, Marc Gabelli authorized Headstart to triple its timing capacity in exchange for a ""sticky asset"" investment in a hedge fund that Marc Gabelli also managed. While Headstart was allowed to time GGGF, Marc Gabelli and Alpert knew that Gabelli Funds' was rejecting, at their direction, other market timers. Alpert allowed Headstart to continue timing GGGF as long as it maintained its investment in other affiliated funds.&nbsp;  Neither Marc Gabelli nor Alpert disclosed to the GGGF Board of Directors that Headstart was allowed to market time GGGF while others were blocked from doing so. To the contrary, Alpert, in Marc Gabelli's presence, assured the Board that market timers were being excluded from GGGF. However, neither Alpert nor Marc Gabelli disclosed to the Board that Headstart was engaging in market-timing activity in GGGF. Indeed, neither Alpert nor Marc Gabelli disclosed to the Board, at that time or any other time during the relevant period, the market timing arrangement with Headstart, the fact that Headstart's investment in Marc Gabelli's hedge fund was made in exchange for increased market timing capacity, or the detrimental effects of Headstart's market timing on GGGF shareholders. By failing to make these disclosures, Marc Gabelli and Alpert aided and abetted Gabelli Funds' breach of fiduciary duty to GGGF.&nbsp;  Over a two-year period, Headstart's internal rates of return on its three accounts were 185 percent, 160 percent, and 73 percent, respectively, while the rate of return for other GGGF shareholders was at most negative 24.1 percent. Gabelli Funds financially benefited from the market timing in that it earned advisory fees from both the market timing and Headstart's investment in the affiliated hedge fund.&nbsp;  In September 2003, Alpert wrote a memorandum to the Board stating that Gabelli Funds had taken a number of steps to discourage market timing. The memorandum, which was posted on Gabelli Funds' parent company's website in the wake of the New York Attorney General's announcement concerning its prosecution of market timers, was designed to assure investors that Gabelli Funds did not have a market timing problem. However, Alpert failed to disclose any facts about Headstart, and the memorandum gave the misleading impression that any failure to exclude market timers resulted from procedural limitations, not intentional conduct by Marc Gabelli and Alpert.   The Complaint charges Marc Gabelli and Alpert with fraud for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It charges Alpert with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Commission simultaneously instituted and settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Gabelli Funds, a registered investment adviser. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Gabelli Funds consented to the issuance of a Commission Order finding that Gabelli Funds willfully violated Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Investment Company Act Rule 17d-1, and willfully aided and abetted and caused violations by GGGF of Section 12(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Investment Company Act in connection with the undisclosed market timing by Headstart. Gabelli Funds was censured, ordered to cease and desist its securities law violations, and ordered to pay $9.7 million in disgorgement, $1.3 million in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $5 million, for a total payment of $16 million. As described in the Order, Gabelli Funds' payment will be distributed to shareholders harmed by the market timing activity during the relevant period.

Greenlaw, Benjamin L. Wissink, Theodore F. Etter, Cara D. Obert and David Hanson.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from at least January 2011 to December 2015, UDF raised approximately $350 million from private and publicly-traded investors through a series of investment funds that raised funds to develop single-family homes and other properties. The complaint further alleges the funds failed to adequately disclose the nature and status of loans made to the developers, which could harm their ability to make distributions to investors. According to SEC filings filed in federal court in Dallas, investors were told that their funds were earning 8% to 9.75% annualized returns and would be used to pay returns to their limited partnership interests. Instead, as alleged, they used the money raised from the investors to fund the development of new development projects and to repay loans to existing and prospective developers. In some cases, developers never actually received the borrowed funds at all and the borrowers never made the promised returns. Finally, when the loans were paid back by the developer, it was able to cause the fund to borrow more money from investors and pay more than $5 million in interest to settle the claims against the other investors in connection with the earlier loans. As a result of the misconduct, defendants charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Under the settlement, a preliminary injunction against future violations of these provisions is set forth in a complaint filed on July 4, 2019.

The SEC also charged a fifth executive for allegedly signing false SEC filings.  According to the SECâs complaint, Texas-based United Development Funding (UDF) is a family of private and publicly-traded investment funds that deploys investor capital as loans to homebuilders and land developers. UDF allegedly solicited investors by advertising annualized returns of up to 9.75 percent as well as regular distributions. According to the complaint, for almost five years, UDF did not tell investors that it lacked the monthly cashflow at times to cover investor distributions in one of its older funds, UDF III. Instead, to pay these distributions, the newer UDF IV fund loaned money to developers who had also borrowed money from UDF III. Rather than using those funds for development projects that were underwritten by UDF IV, UDF directed the developers to use the loaned money to pay down their older loans from UDF III. In most of these cases, the developer never received the borrowed funds at all, and UDF simply transferred the money between funds so that UDF III could make the distributions to its investors. UDF III, UDF IV, and UDF executives Hollis Greenlaw, Benjamin Wissink, Theodore Etter, and Cara Obert knew or should have known that they had misled investors about the use of funds and the nature and status of loans made to developers.  The complaint also alleges that UDF III failed to appropriately impair loans in violation of GAAP, and that UDF IV did not adequately disclose the status of real property within its portfolio. Finally, the complaint alleges that David Hanson signed false and misleading SEC filings and management representation letters without taking sufficient actions to ensure the accuracy of or a sufficient basis for many of their representations.  Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Greenlaw, Wissink, Etter, and Obert agreed to pay $8.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Hanson agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.

The complaint further alleges that from June 27 to July 2, 2008, Grossman and Curshen instructed the agent to purchase approximately 85,000 shares of IBOT stock for a total of approximately $76,000 through matched trades using detailed instructions concerning the size, price and timing of the purchase orders. Thereafter, Grossman and Curshen paid bribes of almost $19,000 to the agent.  The complaint charges Grossman and Curshen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any, plus pre-judgment interest, civil penalties, and an order prohibiting Defendants from participating in any offering of penny stock.

Dawn M. Schlegel, and Sandra L. Hatfield, Case No.: 06-CV-1079 (SDTX)  SEC Charges Former CEO and CFO of DHB Industries, Inc. with Fraudulent Scheme to Manipulate the Company's Inventory and Gross Margins   The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212;Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against former chief financial officer Dawn Schlinger of Pompano Beach, Fla., and former COO Sandra Hutton of Point Blank Body Armor Inc., alleging that they engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the company's inventory and gross margins through fraudulent and repeated violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"").  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least 2003 through the third quarter of 2005, the Defendants routinely overstated the value of inventory by tens of millions of dollars to falsely improve the companies' gross profit and margins. The complaint further alleges that, in every quarter from the beginning of 2003, beginning in 2003 and continuing until the end of 2004, Schterlinger, without any basis whatsoever, falsely inflated the amount of goods sold to materially increase the number of fictitious vests that were used to conceal the fraud. In addition, as part of their scheme, they fraudulently transferred hundreds of thousands of tons of fabricated vist components from inventory to production and sale of an unrelated product line in order to make it appear that the inflated inventory value was actually higher than it actually was. As a result of the fraudulent conduct, Defendants violated Sections 10(b), 13(a)(2)(A), and 13b2-1 of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 12b 2-2, 16a, 17a (1) and 16(2) thereunder, aided and abetted by Defendants' other violations, including Rules 12B-20, 1.2 million or 4%, 13A-11, 15a 1, 14, 20, 2.1 million (2.4 million), 16, 3.3 million and 15,000 (4.5 million","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19806 / August 17, 2006  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2475 / August 17, 2006  SEC v. Dawn M. Schlegel and Sandra Hatfield, (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Civil Action No. 06-61251-CIV-SEITZ/McAliley filed August 17, 2006)    The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of securities fraud charges against Dawn M. Schlegel and Sandra L. Hatfield, two former officers of DHB Industries, Inc., a major supplier of body armor to the United States military and law enforcement agencies. The SEC alleges that Schlegel, DHB's former Chief Financial Officer, and Hatfield, DHB's former Chief Operating Officer, routinely overstated the value of the company's inventory and directed the booking of numerous fraudulent journal entries in order to reduce the company's cost of goods sold. This had the effect of falsely increasing the company's gross profit margins, and in some instances, net income. As a result of their misconduct, DHB materially misstated key financial information in filings with the SEC and in public statements.   According to the SEC's complaint, Schlegel, of Eastport, N.Y., and Hatfield, of Pompano Beach, Fla., regularly overstated the value of DHB's inventory by fraudulently increasing inventory quantities, labor costs, overhead costs, and the amount of raw materials used in DHB's products. The complaint alleges that together Hatfield and Schlegel also transferred millions of dollars of expenses from cost of goods sold to research and development costs to materially increase the company's gross profit. The complaint further alleges that Schlegel falsely inflated DHB's $60 million charge against earnings taken in the third quarter of 2005 to mask her and Hatfield's fraudulent conduct. Schlegel is alleged to have lied to DHB's auditors and provided fake inventory schedules and other documents to conceal the fraud.   The complaint also alleges that during the period of their fraudulent conduct, Schlegel and Hatfield collectively profited by over $8.2 million from the cashless exercise of warrants and sale of over 400,000 DHB shares. Schlegel and Hatfield sold these shares at the end of 2004 at the height of DHB's stock price and before the public knew about the misrepresentations in DHB's filings and public statements.   The Commission's complaint charges Schlegel and Hatfield with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and aiding and abetting DHB's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Schlegel violated Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14 under the Exchange Act. In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, civil penalties, insider trading penalties, and officer and director bars against Schlegel and Hatfield.   The United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York conducted a parallel investigation of this matter. Simultaneous with the SEC's announcement of this action, the United States Attorney's Office announced the filing of charges against Hatfield and Schlegel for securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

Magyar Telekom, PLC, and Deutsche Tippecanese, AG, Civil Action No.: 11-CV-1188 (SDNY)  SEC FILES SETTLED FCPA CHARGES AGAINST DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG AND AGREEMENT TO PAY MORE THAN $10 MILLION IN DISGORGEMENT AND FRAUD  The Commission announced today that it filed a settled enforcement action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Deutsche &amp; Telecommunication, Inc. (""Deutsche&#8217;), a private stock corporation headquartered in Bonn, Germany, for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (""FCPA"").  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, in 2005 and 2006, senior executives then employed by the company, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, organized, approved and executed a plan to bribe government officials in Macedonia to delay or prevent the introduction of a new competitor to the country's telecommunications services provider. The complaint alleges the payments were made with the knowledge, firm belief, or under circumstances that made it substantially certain, that all or a portion of those payments would be offered, promised or paid to Macedonian government and political party officials. In return, these officials would agree to adopt regulatory changes favorable to their respective companies and to prevent a competitor from entering the market. These former executives also offered or promised to receive a valuable business opportunity in return for their party's support of Magyear telekommune's desired benefits. As a result of these payments and offer-and-take-pay schemes, MagYar and its subsidiaries made payments of at least $7.35 million to several third-party consultants under four sham contracts that did not have any legitimate business purpose. This was in order to obtain favorable terms and, at the same time, to facilitate the acquisition of an important competitor. Additionally, as a side note to this scheme, one of its former senior managers offered a contract for a prime Montenegrin government official through a nominee entity identified in connection with a bid to acquire a majority stake in a state-owned telecommunications company in Montenegro. According to","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22213 / December 29, 2011  SEC v. Magyar Telekom Plc. and Deutsche Telekom AG, Case No. 11 civ 9646 (S.D.N.Y.) SEC v. Straub, et al., Case No. 11 civ 9645 (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC CHARGES MAGYAR TELEKOM AND FORMER EXECUTIVES WITH BRIBING OFFICIALS IN MACEDONIA AND MONTENEGRO  Firm and Its Parent Agree to Pay $95 Million to Settle Civil and Criminal Charges  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the largest telecommunications provider in Hungary and three of its former top executives with bribing government and political party officials in Macedonia and Montenegro to win business and shut out competition in the telecommunications industry.    The SEC alleges that three senior executives at Magyar Telekom Plc. orchestrated, approved, and executed a plan to bribe Macedonian officials in 2005 and 2006 to prevent the introduction of a new competitor and gain other regulatory benefits.  Magyar Telekom&#8217;s subsidiaries in Macedonia made illegal payments of approximately $6 million under the guise of bogus consulting and marketing contracts.  The same executives orchestrated a second scheme in 2005 in Montenegro related to Magyar Telekom&#8217;s acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company there.  Magyar Telekom paid approximately $9 million through four sham contracts to funnel money to government officials in Montenegro.  Magyar Telekom&#8217;s parent company Deutsche Telekom AG also is charged with books and records and internal controls violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Magyar Telekom agreed to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges by paying more than $31.2 million in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest.  Magyar Telekom also agreed to pay a $59.6 million criminal penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Deutsche Telekom settled the SEC&#8217;s charges, and as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice agreed to pay a penalty of $4.36 million.  The three former top executives at Magyar Telekom charged by the SEC for orchestrating the bribery schemes are:    Elek Straub, former Chairman and CEO.&nbsp;  Andras Balogh, former Director of Central Strategic Organization.&nbsp;  Tamas Morvai, former Director of Business Development and Acquisitions.    According to the SEC&#8217;s complaints filed in the Southern District of New York, in the wake of legislation intended to liberalize the Macedonian telecommunications market, Magyar Telekom entered into a secret agreement entitled the &#8220;Protocol of Cooperation&#8221; with senior Macedonian government officials to delay or preclude the issuance of a license to a new competitor and mitigate other adverse effects of the new law.  To win their support, Magyar Telekom paid &#8364;4.875 million to a third-party intermediary under a series of sham contracts with the intention that the intermediary would forward money to the government officials.  Magyar Telekom also promised a Macedonian political party the opportunity to designate the beneficiary of a business venture in exchange for the party&#8217;s support.  The SEC further alleges that in Montenegro, Magyar Telekom used intermediaries to pay bribes to government officials in return for their support of Magyar Telekom&#8217;s acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company on terms favorable to Magyar Telekom.  At least two Montenegrin government officials involved in the acquisition received payments made through the bogus contracts.  A family member of a top Montenegrin government official also received payments.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint against Straub, Balogh, and Morvai alleges that they violated Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and that they aided and abetted violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC seeks disgorgement and penalties and the imposition of permanent injunctions.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint against Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom alleges that Magyar Telekom violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act and that Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

69,"On October 11, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California charging four former officers and employees of homebuilder company Desarrolladora Homex, S.A.B. de C.V. with fraud and other violations of the antifraud, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2010 and continuing through the third quarter of 2016, four senior executives and former CFO Carlos Moctezuma, a Mexican citizen residing in Mexico, engaged in a multi-billion dollar fraud to artificially inflate the company's revenues and overstate its number of homes sold and its reported sales. The scheme was designed to create the false appearance of a profitable real estate development company, when, in fact, it was a financial fraud. In addition, according to the complaint, de Nicolás, who served as Chief Executive Officer and Controller from at least 2010 through 2012, improperly entered false revenue from tens of thousands of fictitious home sales over multiple years, as well as manually entered fake cost-of-sale and inventory information from the fictitious transactions. As a result, De Nicolasco made profits and avoided losses from selling HomeX securities, including during the first half of 2013, while participating in this fraud at the Company. Moreover, all four defendants agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying the allegations in connection with the Commission's motion for a permanent injunction against future violations and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting them from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(e) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13e-1, 12a-11, 16a, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 32, 35, 36, 38, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 58, 52, 51, 57, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 67, 70, 78, 66, 74, 77, 79, 85, 90, 82, 88, 89, 91, 98, 93, 94, 102, 97, 105, 99, 95, 96, 86, 100,  and 98%  respectively, for fiscal years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Home","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against former senior officers of Mexico-based homebuilding company Desarrolladora Homex S.A.B. de C.V. for their roles in the company's $3.3 billion accounting fraud.  Homex settled SEC charges earlier this year without admitting or denying allegations that it reported fake sales of more than 100,000 homes to boost revenues during at least a three-year period.  The SEC used satellite imagery to help uncover the accounting scheme and illustrate its allegation that Homex had not even broken ground on many of the homes for which it reported revenues.    According to the SEC's complaint, the multi-billion dollar financial fraud was masterminded by Homex's then-Chief Executive Officer, Gerardo de Nicol&aacute;s, its then-Chief Financial Officer, Carlos Moctezuma, then-Controller, Ram&oacute;n Lafarga, and Noe Corrales, then a manager in the company's operations department.  The complaint alleges that Homex's annual reports for 2010 through 2012, which were filed with the SEC, portrayed the company as productive and financially sound, and that de Nicolas and Moctezuma certified them when they knew Homex was in a dire financial state.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that de Nicolas and Moctezuma caused Homex to enter into loan agreements with at least 13 Mexican banks, which Homex was able to repay only by additional bank borrowing, in check-kiting fashion.  The SEC alleges that de NicolÃ¡s and Moctezuma hid the true nature of these loans from Homex's investors and mischaracterized them to Homex's auditors. The SEC's complaint alleges that Lafarga directed Corrales to create a false second set of books, through which the fraud was perpetrated.  Homex filed for the Mexican equivalent of bankruptcy protection in April 2014 and emerged under new equity ownership in October 2015.  The SEC's complaint alleges that during the Mexican bankruptcy proceedings, de NicolÃ¡s and Moctezuma incorporated the allegedly fraudulent 2010-2012 financial reports into Homex's post-bankruptcy business plan, which they knew would be shared with the company's investors.  The SEC's complaint charges de NicolÃ¡s, Moctezuma, Lafarga, and Corrales with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Homex's violations Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16 thereunder.  The complaint also charges de Nicolas and Moctezuma with violating Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14 under the Exchange Act.  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, civil penalties, and officer and director bars.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Wu Xiaonghua, a resident of Toronto, Canada, is the manager of a hedge funds and the owner and co-chief executive officer of one of his companies. The complaint also names as a relief defendant a Chinese Fund Limited Partnership (the ""Hedge Fund""), a private equity fund whose principals are also members. According to the complaint, Wu told investors that he and his fund, which he controls, generated more than $17.3 million in illicit profits from trading in 2006 and 2007 and posted fake profits in 2008 and 2009. Tang also allegedly used funds from new investors to pay out purported profit investors. In addition, Tang allegedly misappropriated investor funds for his own personal benefit, including to make payments to earlier investors and to fund his lavish lifestyle. Wu allegedly also solicited investors by telling them that his hedge Fund had a minimum return of between 30% and 40% per year, but that the fund was not profitable at all and that it would not be able to meet that goal. To further his scheme, he allegedly misrepresented Wu's income, assets, liabilities, net worth, returns and trading profits. He also claimed that investors' funds were being used to ""purchase"" shares and pay other investors a portion of their initial investment, when in fact they were not.The complaint charges Wu with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar against Wu","UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20988 / April 6, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

SEC Halts On-Going Multi-Million Dollar Ponzi Scheme and Affinity Fraud Involving Investments in a Canadian-Based Hedge Fund  On April 3, 2009, the Commission filed an emergency action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas to halt an on-going multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud involving investments in Oversea Chinese Fund Limited Partnership, a hedge fund based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that Defendant Weizhen Tang, 50, of Toronto orchestrated the fraud scheme through entities he controls, including Defendants Oversea Chinese Fund Limited Partnership (&#8220;Hedge Fund&#8221;) and WinWin Capital Management, LLC, a Plano, Texas-based investment adviser (&#8220;Investment Adviser&#8221;).

The complaint alleges that from at least as early as 2004 to the present, Tang, acting through the Hedge Fund and other entities he controls, raised between $50 million and $75 million from more than 200 investors.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, Weizhen Tang (the self-described &#8220;Chinese Warren Buffet&#8221;) recently admitted to investors that the Hedge Fund operated as a Ponzi scheme since at least 2006.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that Tang told investors in February 2009 that he and the Hedge Fund posted false profits on investors&#8217; account statements for the purpose of concealing substantial trading losses, and to attract new investors to the Hedge Fund.  Further, the Commission alleges that Tang admitted he used funds from new investors to return principal and pay out &#8220;fake&#8221; profits to other investors, which totaled at least $8 million in 2006, 2007, and 2008 &#8212; despite significant trading losses incurred during that time.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, Tang specifically targeted members of the Chinese-American community and solicited U.S. investors to directly and indirectly invest in the Hedge Fund.  The Commission alleges that since at least November 2007, Tang raised capital for the Hedge Fund from U.S. investors by offering and selling limited partnership interests in WinWin Capital Limited Partnership.  The Commission alleges that WinWin Partners&#8217; sole business is investing partnership capital in the Hedge Fund.  As detailed in the complaint, WinWin Partners had raised, as of March 10, 2009, almost $17.3 million in principal investments from approximately 75 investors, most of which are located in the Dallas area, but also include investors in California.  According to the complaint, the U.S. investors have withdrawn approximately $8.4 million from the Hedge Fund, of which at least $700,000 was paid out as purported profits; leaving nearly $9.6 million in investor principal unaccounted for.  The Commission further alleges that, consistent with Tang&#8217;s recent confession to investors, funds invested with WinWin Partners were used to pay other investors in a Ponzi fashion.  The complaint alleges that the Defendants Oversea Chinese Fund, Limited Partnership, Weizhen Tang &amp; Associates, Inc., Weizhen Tang Corp., WinWin Capital Management, LLC, WinWin Capital Limited Partnership, J.O.R &amp; Associates, LLC, and Weizhen Tang violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the offering registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also alleges that Tang, Weizhen Tang &amp; Associates, Inc., J.O.R &amp; Associates, LLC, and WinWin Capital Management, LLC violated Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Tang, Weizhen Tang &amp; Associates, Inc., and J.O.R &amp; Associates, LLC violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  In addition to the emergency relief granted by the Court, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against the Defendants.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that from November 2012 to June 2019, the defendant raised at least $3.5 million from investors worldwide through his entity, Eastern Metal Securities (EMS), which claimed to offer and sell an investment called a ""Pre Funded Retirement Plan"" (PFRPP).  According to the SEC&#8217;s Complaint, EMS claimed that its investment platform was run by award-winning economists and other professional economists from South Africa and Switzerland, and promised a huge ""payout"" on the value of gold entitling investors to an initial $98 investment. The complaint alleges, however, that no such pre-funded pension plan existed and no payment of promised returns was ever made to any investors. Instead, investors transferred more than $4 million of investor funds to other digital asset payment processors, which then misappropriated the funds for their own benefit. In a parallel action, on September 29, 2020, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued a temporary restraining order halting the scheme and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling approximately $1.2 million, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting the violations of Section 20(d) (of the) Securities Rule and Rules 20d-1, 17a-3, 13a2-2, 12b3-11, 15a3 and 16a4-13, respectively.Karlsson has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty of $5,000.

According to the complaint, Karlsson solicited investors for what he described as a ""Pre Funded Reversed Pension Plan,"" falsely claiming that the investment platform was run by award-winning economists and promising a payout based on the value of gold.  Karlsson allegedly claimed that the investment had no risk of loss.  At least 847 of the investors were members of a community for the Deaf that invested more than $2 million in Eastern Metal Securities since 2015 as their retirement investment.

SEC Charges California-Based Financial Adviser With Misappropriating Over $3 Million in Investment Adviser Client Funds   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that, from 2003 to 2009, Brenda â a former financial adviser and registered representative of a nationally recognized financial planning and brokerage firm &#8212; engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate more than three million dollars in investment adviser client funds.  According to the Commission&#8221;s complaint, the misappropriation occurred through the manipulation of client account statements, which falsely stated that the funds were being invested in real estate investment trusts (REITs), when in fact they had not been invested and were instead being transferred to her own personal accounts for personal use. The Complaint alleges that from at least 2003 through 2009 Ó the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief to halt the alleged fraud by the former chief financial officer of Aventine Financial Services, Inc., a registered broker-dealer that provided investment advisory services to clients, including investment advisers and broker dealers. In a parallel action, on February 3, 2011, a federal district court in California entered an order freezing the assets of the defendants, appointing a receiver to preserve and preserve assets, granting expedited discovery and preventing the destruction of documents. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Commission's complaint or any other complaint filed in federal court during the period from March 2003 until October 2009; and, in connection with the issuance of that order and the appointment of an emergency court; the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order, freezing all assets under the control of defendants; appointing an independent receiver; granting a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; freezing assets with prejudgment interest thereon; imposing civil money penalties; ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest; requiring the payment of civil monetary relief; prohibiting any alteration or alteration of records","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22259 / February 15, 2012  SEC CHARGES INVESTMENT ADVISER BRENDA A. ESCHBACH WITH MULTI-YEAR MISAPPROPRIATION OF CLIENT FUNDS  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Brenda A. Eschbach, No. SA CV 12 0244 (AG) (JPRx) (C.D. Cal.).  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on February 14, 2012, it filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California charging Brenda A. Eschbach of Tustin, California with securities fraud, investment advisory fraud, and acting as an unregistered broker-dealer. In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Eschbach misappropriated over $3 million in investment advisory client funds from 2003 through 2009.  The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Eschbach violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933(Securities Act), Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of those provisions, disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil money penalty.  The complaint alleges that Eschbach began to misappropriate client funds while operating a franchise of a large investment adviser and broker-dealer and that the theft of client funds continued after Eschbach founded Aventine Investment Services, Inc., a now-defunct California corporation. The complaint further alleges that Eschbach did not make investments as directed by her clients, instead stealing their funds and using them to pay for, among other things, living expenses, business expenses, credit card payments, Mercedes lease payments, private school tuition for her daughter, and trips to Las Vegas and Atlanta. The complaint alleges that Eschbach concealed her misappropriations by issuing and mailing false and misleading account statements to those clients whom she had defrauded.  Without denying the Commissionâs allegations, Eschbach has consented to entry of a proposed final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; and (2) ordering disgorgement of $2,561,873, payment of which would be deemed satisfied dollar for dollar by criminal restitution ordered in a related criminal proceeding, U.S. v. Brenda A. Eschbach, 8:10-cr-00017-JVS (C.D. Cal.). Entry of the proposed final judgment is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  In the related federal prosecution, Eschbach entered a plea of guilty on September 30, 2011 to one count of mail fraud and one count of money laundering. She is currently awaiting sentencing.  Eschbach has also consented to the issuance of a Commission Order barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. Issuance of such an Order is predicated on entry of the proposed injunction against Eschbach and her plea of guilty in the federal prosecution.

73,"On February 11, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Roger S. Bliss, a resident of Bountiful, Utah, and his investment club, Roger Bliss and Associates Equities, LLC, with engaging in a fraudulent day-trading scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2008, Bliss solicited investors to invest money in his purported ""investment club"" operated out of a large, nice home and a vacation property. The complaint alleges that Bliss claimed to have tremendous success trading Apple Inc. stock, achieving annual returns for his investors of between 100 to 300%. Bliss also allegedly claimed that he had no losses in the past six years and that investors could expect to earn a 100% return on investment each year, but that returns would likely be higher because Bliss has suffered substantial losses and he did not use investor funds to support his trading activities. In addition, according to Bliss' brokerage account showed an ending balance on December 31, 2014 of only $32,362.84. Contrary to his representations, however, he allegedly incurred losses totaling approximately $3,299,689. That same trading account was closed on January 15, 2016, showing an end balance that was only slightly higher than the amount represented on the account's balance sheet. As a result, investors' funds were not used as promised. According the complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (the ""Defendants""), Bliss is not registered as an investment adviser or broker dealer and has no affiliation with any broker-dealer or investment dealer, nor does he have a registered representative. He has been soliciting investors through his website, www.millcreekequities.com, which he uses to solicit investments, by making material misrepresentations and omissions concerning his past performance and expected future profitability; the use of investor money; his ability to manage funds; and the safety of the investment. For example, contrary to what Bliss told investors and potential investors about his supposed track record of trading in Apple stock (AAPL), he has never had a trading day where he lost money and claims that there is no risk for investors as he indemnifies them against the loss of their principal. Despite these assurances, as alleged in Bliss's SEC Complaint, his account shows that from January 1, 2012 through January 12 2015 he incurred a loss totaling $4,959,290, an increase of $48,341.92. This is the","On February 11, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a temporary restraining order and an emergency asset freeze in an offering fraud orchestrated by Roger S. Bliss through his entities, Roger Bliss and Associates Equities, LLC, Roger Bliss and Associates Club LLC, and/or Bliss Club LLC. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bliss, who claims to operate an investment club in which members contribute funds for Bliss to day-trade stock for profit, represents to investors that he has an excellent trading record and has never had a trading day where he has lost money in the last six years. The complaint also alleges that, Bliss tells investors that he trades over $300 million in assets and that investors can expect at least a 100% profit per year. Contrary to Bliss' representations, Bliss' trading has not been profitable.  Bliss' brokerage account shows that from January 1, 2012 through January 12, 2015, Bliss incurred total losses of $3,299,689. On December 31, 2014, Bliss' brokerage account held just $32,362.84.

Brooks, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action Number 07-CV-11-CIV-1949 (ANx)  Securities and Exchange Commission Files Settled Charges Against Former Brookstreet Securities Corp. President and CEO   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil action in the U. S. District court in Orange County, California against former broker-dealer and investment adviser Stanley Brooks. The Commission's complaint alleges that from 2004 to 2007, Brooks and his registered representatives sold unsuitable Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) to retail customers with conservative investment goals, including retirees and retirement accounts.  According to the complaint, the CMO Program was intended to provide safe, secure, liquid investments that were suitable for retirees, retirement account holders, and retail investors. However, as the price of the securities dropped precipitously, many of these customers did not have sufficient equity to cover the margin calls they had received from Brooks or his brokerage firm. As a result of Brooks' actions, some customers lost their savings, their homes, or their ability to retire or stay retired. In addition, certain customers ended up with negative account balances, reflecting the losses they incurred in selling the risky, illiquid programs to customers who had no margin at all. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint or any other SEC enforcement action, Brook and Brooks have consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a) and (c) ofthe Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000 and prohibits Brooks from serving in a supervisory capacity as an officer or director of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from participating in any offering of penny stock or other securities offering. This settlement is subject to approval by the court. Among other things, each defendant has agreed to disgorge $1,077, plus interest, to be paid in civil penalties and to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of this matter.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21328 / December 8, 2009  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA FIRM AND CEO WITH DEFRAUDING CUSTOMERS IN SALES OF RISKY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Irvine, Calif.-based Brookstreet Securities Corp. and its President and CEO Stanley C. Brooks with fraud for systematically selling risky mortgage-backed securities to customers with conservative investment goals.  The fraud cost many Brookstreet investors their savings, homes, or retirement cushions, and eventually caused the firm to collapse.    The SEC alleges that Brookstreet and Brooks developed an internal program through which the firm&#8217;s registered representatives sold particularly risky and illiquid types of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;) to more than 1,000 seniors, retirees, and others for whom they were unsuitable.  The SEC further alleges that Brookstreet continued to promote and sell risky CMOs to retail investors even after Brooks received numerous indications and personal warnings that these were &#8220;dangerous&#8221; investments that could become worthless overnight.  One trader even called Brookstreet&#8217;s program a &#8220;scam.&#8221;  Finally, in a last-ditch effort to save Brookstreet from failing during the financial crisis, Brooks directed the unauthorized sale of CMOs from Brookstreet customers&#8217; cash-only accounts, causing substantial investor losses.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Ana, Calif., Brookstreet customers invested approximately $300&nbsp;million through the firm&#8217;s CMO program between 2004 and 2007.  The SEC alleges that Brooks knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Brookstreet and its registered representatives were selling unsuitable CMOs to retail customers.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint specifically alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against both defendants, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Brooks.  The SEC previously charged 10 Brookstreet registered representatives with making misrepresentations to investors related to the sale of risky CMOs.

Kevin B. Collins, Civil Action No 2:07-cv-0086 (M.D. Tex.)  SEC Charges Former International Business Machines Corporation Business Unit Executive for Aiding and Abetting Accounting Fraud by Dollar General Corporation  On July 21, 2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Texas, alleging that Kevin Collins aided and abetted the commission of accounting fraud by the former owner of the now-defunct National Enron Corporation (""Dollar General"") through a sham transaction. The complaint alleges that in 2000 and 2001, Collins devised and proposed a solution to, as he wrote in an e-mail, a ""book loss"" problem that caused the company to overstate its net income by approximately $10 million for fiscal year 2000. According to the complaint, at the time the Omron transaction was proposed, it was not a bona fide transaction because, among other reasons, IBM intended to destroy the equipment. In addition, although the ""purchase"" price was going to be paid for new IBM equipment for a later date, that purchase price would be offset by an offsetting increase in dollar general's pre-tax income. As a result of this transaction, dollar General overstated its reported pretax income in fiscal 2000 by 6.5%.  The Commission's complaint charges Collins with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b), 13(a)(2)(A) and 17(d)(3)(B), and Rules 10b-5, 12b20 and 13a-11, and the books-and-records and internal-controls provisions. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, defendant Collins has consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement of $7.1 million, plus prejudgment interest of 3.75%, and a $1.25 million civil penalty, both of which will be deemed satisfied by a permanent injunction against future violations of those provisions by certain other defendants.

Kevin B. Collins, Civil Action No. 3:07-0676 (M.D. Tenn.) (filed June 25, 2007)  In the Matter of International Business Machines Corporation, Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-55954, Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Rel. No. 2623 (June 25, 2007)  SEC Files Settled Actions Against Kevin B. Collins and IBM for Assisting in Dollar General Corporation's Accounting Fraud    The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled civil action against Kevin B. Collins, an employee of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), for aiding and abetting Dollar General Corporation's commission of accounting fraud. The Commission filed the civil action against Collins in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. As set forth in the Commission's complaint, Collins assisted Dollar General's commission of accounting fraud through a sham transaction that was designed to achieve a particular accounting result for Dollar General. Also today, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against IBM for its role in the Dollar General fraud and for IBM's own books and records violations.  According to the Commission's complaint, in 1999, IBM and Dollar General agreed that Dollar General would lease new electronic cash registers from IBM to replace Dollar General's old registers. As originally planned, Dollar General would phase out the old registers and purchase the new IBM equipment over a multi-year period. As alleged in the Commission's complaint, in the second half of 2000, IBM, through Collins, instead suggested that Dollar General accelerate the roll-out of new IBM equipment by leasing for approximately $10 million all of the new equipment by the end of 2000. This would have the result of increasing IBM's revenue for fiscal year 2000, as well as increasing Collins' bonus compensation for that period. As alleged by the Commission, Dollar General initially rejected the proposal, however, due to an accounting problem. Specifically, if Dollar General replaced all of the Omron equipment, it would be required to write off the book value of that equipment as an expense. This ""book loss"" problem, as it became known, in turn, would have a negative impact on Dollar General's earnings for its fiscal year 2000.  The Commission further alleges in its complaint that IBM, through Collins, devised a way to solve Dollar General's ""book loss"" problem. Specifically, Collins proposed that IBM would purchase Dollar General's old cash registers for approximately $11 million. As alleged, by selling the equipment at that price, Dollar General would avoid most of the negative consequences of having to write off the book value of the equipment that would have occurred if it simply replaced the old registers with the new IBM equipment. According to the Commission's complaint, the proposed ""purchase"" was not a bona fide transaction because, among other reasons, IBM's purchase price for Dollar General's old cash registers was repaid to IBM by an offsetting increase in the amount that Dollar General was to pay for the new IBM equipment. In addition, although IBM agreed to buy the Omron equipment for more than Dollar General was going to pay for the new IBM registers, IBM and Collins knew that the old cash registers were worthless to IBM, IBM intended to destroy the equipment, and ultimately IBM never took possession of any of the sales registers. As alleged, IBM nevertheless engaged in the ""purchase"" and Dollar General removed the old cash registers from its books and minimized the negative impact on its earnings in fiscal year 2000.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, as a result of his conduct, Collins aided and abetted Dollar General's violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-11. Collins has agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from aiding and abetting violations of these provisions. In addition, the final judgment orders Collins to pay $95,000, comprising $48,769 in disgorgement, $21,231 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $25,000. Collins' settlement is subject to court approval.  In the related administrative proceeding instituted today against IBM, the Commission found that, as a result of the above-referenced conduct, IBM caused Dollar General's violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20 and 13a-11. The Commission's order also finds that IBM maintained inaccurate books and records during 2000 and 2001 as a result of numerous discrete revenue recognition errors that took place in the United States and at least 23 other countries, totaling approximately $577 million in revenues over that two-year period. The order also finds that IBM violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) by failing to keep accurate books and records. IBM, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, consented to the issuance of the Commission's order directing IBM to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of these provisions. Under the terms of the order, IBM also undertakes to pay $7 million to the court in connection with the Commission's previously filed action SEC v. Dollar General, et al. C.A.

76,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Robert A. Karmann, the former CFO of a California solar energy company, with orchestrating a massive Ponzi scheme that bilked over $910 million from investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of California, from at least 2011 through 2018, Company S, a company owned by Karman, raised approximately $2.7 billion from approximately 17,600 investors through a series of investment contracts that were purportedly to be used to develop, manufacture, and lease mobile solar power generation equipment (generators).  The complaint alleges that, instead of using investor funds to manufacture and operate the Generators as promised, as the company claimed, investors paid hundreds of millions of dollars for them to lease them and used the money to make lease payments and distributions to earlier investors, including luxury vehicles and real estate, for their personal benefit, such as car purchases and purchases of luxury cars and homes.Â  The SEC alleges in its complaint that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by transferring and/or coordinating the transfer of funds among various bank accounts to hide the lack of legitimate lease revenue and by providing false and misleading reports and financial statements that he knew contained false information to investors and the Company. The defendants also violated Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) respectively of Securities Act and Section 206(e)(2), and Rules 17a-1, 17b2-2, 13a-'13 and 13b1-13.

The defendant has agreed to settle the SEC's charges, with monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, Robert A. Karmann, the CFO for one of the two companies, was an integral participant in a massive Ponzi scheme that raised approximately $910 million from 17 investors between 2011 and 2018.  Investors allegedly were induced by others involved in the scheme to invest in tax credit investment contracts and sale leaseback investments through promises of gains in the form of tax credits, guaranteed lease payments, and profits from the operation of mobile service generators.  In reality, the complaint alleges, thousands of the purportedly profitable generators were never even manufactured, let alone put into use, and the vast majority of revenue to investors came from Ponzi-like payments, where funds from new investors were used to pay off old investors, not from actual lease payments.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in late 2014, Karmann advanced the scheme by transferring or coordinating the transfer of funds among the bank accounts of the two California-based companies to hide the lack of legitimate lease revenue.  He also provided brokers, investors and prospective investors reports and financial statements that he knew contained false information.  The SEC's complaint charges Karmann with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Ahmed recommended that Oak's funds make multi-million dollar investments in companies that he advised - funds whose money came from public pension funds and other institutional and individual investors - and recommended the purchase of shares of a Chinese e-commerce company at a price that was significantly higher than the sellers actually agreed to sell their shares. According to the complaint, Ahmed then diverted the excess funds to an account he controlled, which he used to pay for his personal expenses. The complaint further alleges Ahmed violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(2), 207(4), and 206 (4)-8 of Investment Advisers Act (Adviser Act).

In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut on last Wednesday and unsealed today, the SEC alleges that Iftikar Ahmed illegally profited by having funds managed by Oak Investment Partners pay inflated prices for two e-commerce investments and by failing to disclose his beneficial interest in a company that the fund transacted with.  The complaint alleges that Ahmed transferred approximately $27.5 million in illegal profits to accounts under his control at the expense of investors in the Oak funds, including public pension investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, Ahmed had Oak funds pay $20 million for a $2 million stake in an Asian e-commerce joint venture in December 2014, pocketing the $18 million difference for himself.  It alleges that in another investment in August 2014, an Oak fund overpaid for shares in a China-based e-commerce company, allowing Ahmed to pocket $2 million.  In a third transaction, the complaint alleges that in 2013, Ahmed advised an Oak fund to invest $25 million in a U.S.-based e-commerce company without disclosing his interest in I-Cubed Domains LLC, which had a significant stake in the same company.  The following year, at Ahmed's advice, the Oak fund paid $7.5 million to I-Cubed to buy shares in the company that I-Cubed had acquired for $2 million.  The complaint alleges that Ahmed again failed to disclose his ties to I-Cubed, violating his duty to act in the best interest of the Oak fund investors and avoid self-dealing.

The SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction to continue the freeze of Ahmed's assets and seeks to have Ahmed return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil monetary penalties.  The complaint names two firms allegedly controlled by Ahmed, Iftikar Ali Ahmed Sole Prop and I-Cubed Domains LLC, as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering allegedly ill-gotten gains.  The emergency court order obtained by the SEC freezes up to $55,089,446 million of Ahmed's assets, prohibits him from destroying evidence and orders expedited discovery.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jay A. Scoggins and Jeffrey E. Oraker of the Market Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office.  The case has been supervised by Daniel M. Hawke, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and Joseph G. Sansone, Co-Deputy Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.  Nicholas P.

July 16, 2002)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 29, 2002, it filed an amended Complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against National Presto Industries, Inc. (&quot;National Presto&quot;) located in Eau Clare, Wisconsin.  The Complaint alleges that National Presto, since at least 1994, has operated as an unregistered investment company in violation of Section 7(a) of the Investment Company Act.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that National Presto is primarily engaged in investing and reinvesting in securities and that the company's balance sheets demonstrate that National Presto's investment securities have exceeded 40% of its total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) since at least 1994.  In fact, from 1994-2000, National Presto had investment securities totaling at least 70% of its total assets.  The complaint also alleges that National Presto's board, including, Melvin Cohen, National Presto's Chairman Emeritus, and Maryjo Cohen, National Presto's Chairwoman, President and Chief Executive Officer, have directed National Presto's investment activities since at least 1994.  National Presto's treasurer invested the company's assets at the direction of and pursuant to policies set by the Cohens and the complaint alleges that the board and the Cohens have been aware of the facts and circumstances surrounding National Presto's violation of the Investment Company Act since at least 1996.  Nevertheless, National Presto's Board and the Cohens failed to cause National Presto to comply with the Investment Company Act.  As a result of National Presto's failure to register as an investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the Investment Company Act, the Commission alleges that shareholders have been denied the benefits of the Investment Company Act, including several provisions designed to protect them from, among other things, theft, self-dealing, fraud, excessive fees, and breach of fiduciary duty.      &nbsp;SEC Complaint in this matter.",0.4803,0.4783

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Robert Goldstein, MSI's former Chief Executive Officer, solicited investors to purchase a series of securities promising a return of principal plus 22 percent annual interest, almost always for a term of five years (Notes).  MSI advertised the 22% Notes in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and Investor's Business Daily from at least October 2010 through approximately August 2011 and raised more than $1 million through sales of the Notes. The complaint further alleges Goldstein was the primary salesperson for MSI, and he and Goldstein both communicated with potential and actual investors about the notes. According to the complaint:  Goldstein knew, or recklessly disregarded, that these statements were false and that Goldstein provided investors with a wide array of material facts and otherwise misleading information in an effort to sell the shares. Specifically, Goldstein misrepresented that MSI had millions of dollars in cash and other assets and had no overseas operations, let alone significant revenues from Mexico.&nbsp;  Among Goldstein&rsquo;s misrepresentations were statements that he knew and was reckless in not knowing, but necessary to prevent his affirmative statements from being misleading. Among other misstatements, among other things, were representations that the company's ""explosive"" growth potential was an infinitesimal part of its assets; that its ""anti-piracy"" and anti-terrorism"" business was ""probably one ofthe largest ... on the high seas"" in 2011; and &ldash;that such business, including in Somalia and Yemen, was expected","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22120 / October 11, 2011  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

WITH FRAUD AND CONDUCTING AN ILLEGAL OFFERING OF SECURITIES  On October 7, 2011, United States District Judge John G. Koeltl entered an order, consistent with a stipulated agreement between the Commission and Defendants, preliminarily enjoining Murdoch Security &amp; Investigations, Inc. (&#8220;Murdoch&#8221;) and its two principal officers, Robert Goldstein and William Vassell from continuing an allegedly illegal, unregistered offering and sale of securities that the Commission alleges raised more than $1 million from noteholders, who were promised 22% annual interest on their investments.  Judge Koeltl&#8217;s order also preliminarily enjoined Defendants Murdoch and Goldstein from further violations of certain anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and froze certain of Defendants&#8217; assets pending final disposition of the case.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Defendants, beginning in approximately October 2010, offered and sold notes to investors by placing advertisements in the Wall Street Journal and other financial press.  The Commission further alleges that Murdoch, through Goldstein, misrepresented material facts to investors about the security company, including boasts of highly lucrative overseas operations when, in fact, Murdoch lacked any international business whatsoever.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, Murdoch told investors that capital was needed to finance acquisitions of additional security companies that would enhance Murdoch&#8217;s overall revenues and fund 22% interest payments to noteholders.  In reality, the Commission alleges, money from new investors has been used primarily to fund interest payments to earlier investors and to pay the salaries of Defendants Goldstein and Vassell.   The Commission&#8217;s complaint charges each Defendant with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Defendants Murdoch and Goldstein with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions against the defendants, and to have them return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and pay civil monetary penalties.

The Commission's complaint alleges that the five defendants knew, among other things, that:  (1) that they knew that their city faced severe difficulty funding its pension and retiree health care obligations unless new revenues were obtained, pension benefits were reduced, or City services were cut; and (2) they were aware that, at the time of their disclosures, City's projected financial crisis was imminent.&nbsp; (3) They also knew they had substantial knowledge of and experience in raising the funds for City employees' pension plans and other non-pension benefits, when, in fact, they did not.

In addition, according to the complaint, during the relevant period, city staff and CERS made presentations to rating agencies on a yearly basis, both in and out of conference calls and in press releases, to determine whether to underfund City pension obligations and/or other pension liabilities.

Uberuaga, the former San Diego City Manager, Edward P. Ryan, the former Auditor &amp; Comptroller, Patricia Frazier, the former Deputy City Manager for Finance, Teresa A. Webster, the former Assistant Auditor &amp; Comptroller, and Mary E. Vattimo, the former City Treasurer, with fraud in connection with the City&#8217;s false and misleading financial statements in five 2002 and 2003 bond offerings.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, these five former officials knew that the city had been intentionally under-funding its pension obligations so that it could increase pension benefits but defer the costs.  They were aware that the city would face severe difficulty funding its future pension and retiree health care obligations unless new revenues were obtained, pension and health care benefits were reduced, or city services were cut.  They specifically knew that the city&#8217;s unfunded liability to its pension plan was projected to dramatically increase, growing from $284 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 to an estimated $2 billion by 2009, and that the city&#8217;s liability for retiree health care was another estimated $1.1 billion.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that the officials violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by failing to disclose these and other material facts to rating agencies or to investors in bond offering documents and continuing disclosures.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the officials from further violations of the securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, alleges the following.  Uberuaga signed the closing letter for one of the bond offerings, falsely certifying that it was accurate and did not contain any misleading statements.  Ryan signed letters falsely representing that the city&#8217;s audited financial statements included in the securities offerings were accurate.  Frazier regularly reviewed and revised the false and misleading disclosure documents, and signed the closing letter for two of the five bond offerings.  She falsely certified that the disclosures were accurate and did not contain any misleading statements.  Additionally, she reviewed and made presentations to the rating agencies.  Webster reviewed the city&#8217;s financial statements that contained some of the false and misleading disclosures, and Vattimo participated in drafting the city&#8217;s false and misleading disclosures.  Additionally, Vattimo and Webster both knew that in 2003, the rating agencies had concerns about the city&#8217;s growing pension obligations and that those obligations could negatively affect the city&#8217;s credit rating.  Nevertheless, they withheld material facts from the rating agencies.    The Commission previously entered an order sanctioning the City of San Diego for committing securities fraud by failing to disclose to the investing public important information about its pension and retiree health care obligations in the sale of its municipal bonds in 2002 and 2003.&nbsp; To settle the action, the city agreed to cease and desist from future securities fraud violations and to retain an independent consultant for three years to foster compliance with its disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws.&nbsp;   The Commission also previously filed a settled civil injunctive action against the outside auditors for the City of San Diego and its pension system, Thomas J.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, between 2007 and 2013, Kuhnavash and Jimoff engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell the stock of a plastics manufacturing company they controlled. They claimed that it could transform ""garbage to gold"" into high-quality plastics that met customer specifications. The complaint alleges that, instead of telling customers the truth, they routinely sent them fake test results to fool them into thinking that their products passed customer standards. In fact, according to one of the complaint's complaints, these false tests were used to hide the fraud from the public and allowed the defendants to raise more than $1.3 million from prospective buyers. As alleged, in September 2013 and January 2014, when the alleged fraud was discovered by Citadel Plastics Holdings, LLC, both of which owned and operated a significant equity stake in this company and were sold to a third-party company, LuCent, for a total of over $538,000 in proceeds. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant agreed to settle the action by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, an officer-and-director bar and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Sections 13(e), 14(d), and 15(c) (a)(1), 13a-14, 13b2-1 and (2) the securities registration and audit provision of Rule 13e-3 there under the Investment Advisers Act (the ""Adviser Act"").

According to the Commission's complaint, from at least March 2008 through June 2008, Daniel S. Laikin, a Los Angeles, California resident, paid kickbacks in exchange for generating or causing purchases of stock to a stock promoter and the Cooperating Witness (CW), an individual whom they believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives. In reality, the CW was, at all times, cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The complaint further alleges that, as part of this scheme, Dougherty generated purchases for himself and others in order to keep the stock price above the minimum listing requirements of a publicly traded stock exchange. The Commission alleges, however, that the defendants never disclosed the manipulative scheme and made materially misleading statements in connection with their July 17, 2007 tender offer to acquire the shares in an offer that was not subject to approval by the SEC. As a result of their illegal activity, these shares were sold at a profit and at the price of $5.00 per share, which would have artificially boosted the share price.

Laikin, National Lampoon's CEO, Charged with Paying Kickbacks in Exchange for Manipulating the Market for National Lampoon's Stock  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it charged seven individuals and two corporations with engaging in three separate fraudulent schemes to manipulate the market for publicly traded securities through the payment of prearranged kickbacks. The defendants include National Lampoon, Inc. and its CEO, Daniel S. Laikin, as well as stock promoters, a consultant, and an officer of another company. The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today separately announced criminal charges involving the same conduct.  The Commission's actions, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, allege that, in each case, individuals who controlled the stock of a public company arranged with corrupt promoters and others to generate purchases of the company's stock in exchange for cash kickbacks. In each case, a witness secretly cooperating with the government (the ""CW"") was paid a kickback to make purchases in the stock. The goal of the manipulators was to create the appearance of market interest, induce public purchases of the stock, and ultimately increase the stock's trading price. For example, the Commission alleges that Daniel Laikin and another defendant paid at least $68,000 in cash kickbacks for the purchase of National Lampoon stock in order to artificially inflate the stock price.  The Commission's complaints allege as follows:  SEC v. National Lampoon, Inc. et al.  Defendants: National Lampoon, Inc., headquartered in Los Angeles, California, is a media and entertainment company that develops, produces and distributes media projects including feature films, television programming, online and interactive entertainment, home video, and book publishing. The company produced such widely known films as National Lampoon's Animal House, and the National Lampoon Vacation series. National Lampoon's common stock is registered with the Commission and is listed on the NYSE Alternext, formerly the American Stock Exchange (""AMEX""). Daniel S. Laikin, of Los Angeles, California, has been the Chief Executive Officer of National Lampoon since 2005. Laikin controls approximately 40 percent of the voting stock of National Lampoon. Dennis S. Barsky, of Las Vegas, Nevada, is a consultant to National Lampoon, and a significant stockholder. Eduardo Rodriguez, of Livingston, New Jersey, is a stock promoter. Tim Dougherty, of Webster, New York, is a stock promoter and principal of OTC Advisors, Inc., a stock promotion company.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least March 2008 through June 2008, Laikin, Barsky, Rodriguez and Dougherty engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of National Lampoon. Specifically, Laikin, along with Barsky, paid kickbacks in exchange for generating or causing purchases of National Lampoon stock to Rodriguez, a corrupt stock promoter, and the CW, whom Laikin, Barsky and Rodriguez believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives. As part of this scheme, Dougherty generated purchases of National Lampoon stock in exchange for a portion of the kickbacks. Dougherty made his purchases over the course of a number of days and used various accounts to give the false impression of a steady demand for the stock.  The complaint alleges that Laikin and Barsky paid at least $68,000 that went to Rodriguez, Dougherty, and the CW to cause the purchase of at least 87,500 shares of National Lampoon stock. Through these efforts, Laikin and Barsky sought to artificially push National Lampoon's stock price from under $2 per share to at least $5 per share, in part, to keep the company's stock price above the minimum listing requirements of the AMEX, and to increase National Lampoon's ability to enter into possible ""strategic partnerships"" and acquisitions. In addition to paying others to purchase the stock, Laikin shared confidential financial information regarding National Lampoon, non-public news releases, and confidential shareholder lists, and coordinated the release of news with the illegal purchases in the stock. Barsky helped direct the purchases and facilitated the kickback payments. National Lampoon and Laikin also made materially misleading statements in a tender offer.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b) and 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13e-4 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, from the individual defendants, and an officer and director bar against Laikin.  SEC v. Advatech Corporation, et al.  Defendant Advatech Corporation is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida. It describes itself as an early stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development for the commercialization of products for non-invasive therapeutic medicine. Advatech's securities trade on the grey market. Grey market stocks have no market makers, and are not listed, traded or quoted on any stock exchange, or the over-the-counter bulletin board. However, customers may trade through brokers on an unsolicited basis, and trading data is publicly available throughout the trading day. Defendant Richard J. Margulies, of Edison, New Jersey, is Advatech's Chief Financial Officer and a member of its board of directors. Margulies owns and/or controls a significant portion of Advatech stock either directly or through nominees.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least May 2008 through June 2008, Margulies engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Advatech's common stock. In furtherance of the scheme, Margulies arranged to pay a 20 percent kickback to Rodriguez and the CW for purchases of Advatech stock. Before Rodriguez and the CW made the illegal purchases, Margulies provided them with shareholder lists, confidential information about the company, and non-public press releases. Margulies coordinated the release of news with the purchases, said that he wanted to increase Advatech's stock price from approximately $0.30 to $2.00 per share, and instructed Rodriguez and the CW that they should ""move [the stock] up nice and slow, so it doesn't look like we're a bunch of idiots.""  The complaint alleges that, to effectuate his scheme, Margulies paid at least $1,040 in kickbacks as partial payments to the CW in exchange for purchases of at least 5,000 shares of Advatech stock on June 17 and 18, 2008.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Advatech and Margulies, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Margulies.  SEC v. Alex Kanakaris, et al.  Defendants Alex Kanakaris, of Newport Beach, California, and Richard Epstein, of Parkland, Florida, are stock promoters who are significant investors in the stock of SwedishVegas, Inc., headquartered in Arcadia, California, whose stated business plan is to ""launch a series of themed eateries with an extensive beer and wine menu and reasonably priced lunches, dinners and appetizers."" Until July 23, 2008, when the Commission suspended trading in its stock, SwedishVegas common stock was quoted on an inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system in the over-the-counter securities market which is operated by Pink OTC Markets, Inc., commonly known as the ""Pink Sheets.""  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least June through July 2008, Kanakaris and Epstein engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of SwedishVegas. Specifically, the defendants paid a kickback to Rodriguez, a corrupt stock promoter, and the CW, whom they believed had connections to corrupt stockbrokers, to buy Swedish Vegas stock in an effort to create the appearance of market interest, induce public purchases of stock, and ultimately increase the stock's trading price. At one point, Kanakaris told Rodriguez and the CW that he wanted them to buy as much stock as possible in order to make the stock price ""fly.""  The complaint further alleges that, in accordance with their scheme, Kanakaris and Epstein paid at least $15,000 to Rodriguez and the CW in exchange for completed purchases of at least 125,000 shares of SwedishVegas stock on July 22, 2008. After this initial stock purchase, actually made with FBI funds, the Commission suspended trading in the stock.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, together with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars from the defendants.  In addition to the enforcement actions, the Commission today entered an order suspending trading in the securities of National Lampoon, Inc. and Advatech Corporation for a ten day period commencing 9:30 a.m. December 15, 2008.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).    Complaint v.

Escala Group, Inc., et al., Civil Action No.: 09-CV-1079 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES ESCALA GROUP, INC. AND ITS FORMER CFO WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH INTERNATIONAL MARKET PONZI SCHEME  On September 29, the Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging escala with violations of the antifraud, reporting and books and records provisions of federal securities laws in connection with a series of fraudulent related party transactions involving the sale of hundreds of thousands of tons of stamps to investors in Spain.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, beginning in October 2003, Gregory Manning and Larry Lee Crawford, then the company's then-chief financial officer and chief executive officer, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the prices of stamp and art collections in Europe in order to satisfy a demand for stamp portfolios that Spanish authorities had called a ""ponzi scheme.""  According to the complaint, these fraudulent transactions contributed more than $80 million toEscala's revenues and allowed it to meet its forecasts for either revenue or pre-tax net income for fiscal years 2004 and fiscal year-end 2005. As a result of these transactions and related parties' control of certain stamp portfolio values and sales of other products, Escalan went from trading at $1.47 per share on January 23, 2003 to $898 million on September 30, 2006, when it was delisted and deregistered for failing to file its SEC Form 10-Q and quarterly reports for 2003 and 2005, which were filed with the Commission. The complaint further alleges, among other things, that Manning, who served as CEO, was a member of an executive committee that negotiated a deal with Afinsa Group Inc. (GMAI) to acquire the right to sell the stamps in exchange for payment for business combination-related expenses. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Manning has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Ex","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20965 / March 23, 2009  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3031 / March 23, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Escala Group, Inc., Gregory Manning, and Larry Lee Crawford, CPA, Civil Action No. 09 CV 2646 (DLC) (S.D.N.Y., March 23, 2009)  SEC Charges Escala Group, Inc., its Former CEO and CFO with Disclosure and Accounting Fraud Concerning Related Party Transactions with Parent Company Afinsa  Escala enters into a proposed simultaneous settlement  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a disclosure and accounting fraud case against then-NASDAQ National Market issuer Escala Group, Inc.; its founder and former CEO Gregory Manning, 62; and its former CFO Larry Lee Crawford, 60, alleging fraudulent related party transactions between Escala and its parent company, Afinsa Bienes Tangibles, S.A. (""Afinsa""). Escala is a network of companies in the collectibles market specializing in stamps, among other things. Afinsa was a privately held Spanish company that sold investments in portfolios of stamps in Europe. According to the complaint, the fraudulent related-party transactions ceased after May 2006, when Spanish authorities raided Afinsa's offices and charged Afinsa and certain individuals with engaging in a massive unlawful pyramid scheme.  The SEC complaint alleges a fraudulent business scheme based upon the secret and dramatic manipulation of collectible stamp values, in which Escala, Manning, and Crawford violated the antifraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by:   failing to disclose the related party status of Barrett &amp; Worthen, Inc., resulting in control of the Brookman Catalogue, and failing to disclose the revenues obtained by virtue of Afinsa and Manning's control of the prices in the Brookman Catalogue;  falsely representing that Escala sold Afinsa several large stamp archives at prices determined by reference to independent stamp catalogues and appraisals when in fact Manning set the catalogue prices and influenced and edited the appraisals; and  falsely reporting a payment for business combination-related expenses as the ""sale"" of certain antiques. The complaint alleges that Escala and Manning also violated the antifraud provisions by selling back to Afinsa in a round-trip transaction inventory acquired from Afinsa in direct contravention of Escala's public promise not to do so.   The complaint alleges that these false and misleading disclosures and omissions were material in that the related-party transactions contributed over $80 million to Escala's revenues and allowed Escala to meet its forecasts for either revenue or pre-tax net income for the third quarter and for year-end of fiscal year 2004, and for the first quarter and year-end in fiscal 2005. According to the complaint, as a result of these transactions, Escala went from trading at $1.47 per share on January 23, 2003, to a $32-per-share company with a purported market cap of $898 million in the span of a few years.  The complaint charges Escala with violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 78j(b), 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)] and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, [17 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 240.10b-5, 240.12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13]. Simultaneous with the filing of the complaint in a Consent and proposed Final Judgment submitted for the Court's consideration, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Escala consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions.  The complaint charges defendants Manning and Crawford with violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 78j(b) and 78m(b)(5)] and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14, [17 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 240.10b-5, 240.13b2-1, 240.13b2-2 and 240.13a-14], aiding and abetting Escala's violations of Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, and seeks permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer and director bars.

85,"On December 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Laguna Niguel-based investment advisory firm and its principal, Craig Arsenault, with defrauding several of his advisory clients out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that, from at least January 2014 to the present, Atlas Capital Management, Inc. and ACT Global Investments (ACT) raised approximately $5.7 million from approximately nine clients, many of whom are doctors, by promising that their funds would be invested in income-producible investments and guaranteed to be used within 30 to 60 days should the client default on a loan. The complaint alleges, however, that the investments were not generating the reported interest income, and the clients were instead misappropriating substantial portions of client funds to make short-term loans to doctors and to repay other clients. In addition, as alleged, ACT's monthly account statements failed to disclose the substantial amount of investor money that had been invested, which was not disclosed to any of its clients or the investors who invested the funds in ACT. Finally, in a parallel action, on December 14, 2019, a federal court in Los Angeles entered a temporary restraining order against ACT and Atlas, both of which are located in Orange County, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) and (c) of the federal securities laws and Section 10(b) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating those provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $50,000 and $25,849, respectively. ACT has also agreed to a preliminary injunction against future violations of these provisions, to which it has offered to submit a sworn sworn statement of financial condition, an accounting for its assets under management and an order prohibiting it from being used as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. A preliminary hearing on the Commission's motion has been scheduled for 12/13/18, but the hearing will be held at 1:00 p.m. ET on January 31, 2020 to determine whether the appropriate time for discovery is appropriate.","The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Laguna Niguel, California investment adviser with misappropriating client funds and misleading his clients about how their money was invested and how their investments were performing.  The SEC is seeking an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver to prevent any ongoing misappropriation or dissipation of assets.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Craig Arsenault defrauded clients of his advisory firm, Atlas Capital Management, Inc., who had invested $5.7 million in a company he controlled, ACT Global Investments.  According to the complaint, Arsenault solicited investments in ACT, telling his advisory clients that their funds would be used to make secured loans to doctors for the purpose of acquiring medical equipment.  The complaint alleges that Arsenault and ACT used client funds instead to make unsecured loans to, for example, a used car dealership, and to acquire undeveloped real estate.  As alleged in to the complaint, Arsenault then provided clients with deceptive account statements that made it appear as if these investments were generating substantial income when they were not.  The SEC also alleges that Arsenault misappropriated and misused over $1 million of the client money invested in ACT.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges Arsenault, Atlas, and ACT with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Arsenault and Atlas with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants raised approximately $3.5 million from at least 60 investors by offering false and misleading promises of safe investments and guaranteed returns, including paying back an investor, purchasing an unrelated real estate investment and operating a multi-family housing project. According to the complaint, defendants solicited investments by claiming that investors were ready to invest in ""multi-million dollar properties under construction."" They claimed that their money would be used to purchase and purchase several thousand units of real property, which would yield a net 123% total investment return over five years. None of these representations were true.  The complaint further alleges, among other things, that defendants made misrepresentations about the safety of the investments, failed to disclose the fact that certain investments were not profitable, or that funds were being misappropriated for personal use. In addition, there was no reasonable basis for defendants' claims of a safe and secure investment. Instead, they used investor funds to pay returns to other investors, fund the purchase of other properties, pay off an earlier investor with an additional $80 million in commissions, transfer investor money to and from other companies owned and controlled, make personal loan payments to a third individual, misused investor monies to fund personal living expenses and other expenses for unrelated personal expenses.

Mass. March 1, 2010)SEC CHARGES MASSACHUSETTS-BASED OPERATORS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FRAUDThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an enforcement action on March 1, 2010 in federal district court in Massachusetts against three individuals and the four entities that they operate in connection with inter-related real estate investment frauds. The Commission's complaint alleges that Kathleen S. Dobens and Charles T. Dobens, husband and wife business partners from Duxbury, Massachusetts, together with another business partner, Joseph A. Roche of Braintree, Massachusetts, defrauded approximately 60 investors who invested approximately $3.5 million beginning as early as 2007.The Commission's complaint alleges that the individual defendants established four entities through which they operated. These entities, which were each operated out of the Dobens' home and are each named as defendants in the case, are Silex Group, LLC, Preakness Apartments I &amp; II, LLC, Cherry Hills Apartments of Fort Worth, LLC, and Clear River Partners, LLC.The Commission's complaint alleges that in February 2009, the individual defendants created Silex to solicit investors' money with false promises of secured investments and guaranteed annual returns of 9% or 12%. According to the complaint, Silex and the individual defendants used a website and a series of other oral and written representations to solicit investments. The website claimed, among other things, that Silex owned over $20 million in real estate assets and would pool investors' money to invest in ""multi-family housing assets."" In reality, Silex never owned any real estate assets and the funds raised for Silex were diverted to repay an earlier Silex investor, for personal expenses of the individual defendants, and for expenses for other entities owned and controlled by the individual defendants (including three entities charged by the Commission as relief defendants: East Coast Investment Solutions, LLC; Dobens Company, LLC; and Crosscreeks Apartments II, LLC). The complaint also alleges that Silex commingled funds with relief defendant Crosscreeks Apartments I.The Commission's complaint also alleges that the individual defendants operated earlier real estate investment frauds using the other entity defendants that they created. According to the complaint, during 2007 and 2008, the individual defendants, acting through Clear River Partners, solicited investors in Preakness Apartments, an entity that owned an apartment complex in Lexington, Kentucky, and Cherry Hills Apartments, an entity that owned an apartment complex in Forth Worth, Texas. The complaint alleges that investors in those entities were misled to believe that they stood to gain substantial profits. For example, according to the complaint, investors in Preakness Apartments were told that they would receive a yearly return of 9% on their investment, and investors in Cherry Hills Apartments were told that they would earn a 123% return in five years. In fact, according to the complaint, neither investment was profitable. The complaint alleges that Cherry Hills Apartments was foreclosed upon and auctioned off in January 2010, and that during that same month, defendant Roche was soliciting investors for additional funds just to keep Preakness Apartments afloat for the year, promising investors a premium if they put more money into Preakness Apartments.The Commission's complaint alleges that defendants Kathleen S. Dobens, Charles T. Dobens, Joseph A. Roche, Silex Group, LLC, Preakness Apartments I &amp; II, LLC, Cherry Hills Apartments of Fort Worth, LLC, and Clear River Partners, LLC, violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission seeks the entry of permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against the defendants. The Commission also charged as relief defendants East Coast Investment Solutions, LLC, Dobens Company, LLC, Crosscreeks Apartments I, and Crosscreeks Apartments II, LLC, and seeks from them disgorgement plus prejudgment interest concerning investor funds that were diverted to them.On March 3, 2010, the Honorable Mark L.

Kansas)  SEC Files Settled Enforcement Action Against Former Senior Executives of Brooke Corporation, Its Subsidiaries, and Broker-Dealer Aleritas Capital Corporation and Former Broomankers Kyle L. Garst and Travis W. Vrbas, for Their Role in Improperly Defrauding Brooke Franchisees   The Commission announced today that it filed an enforcement action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas against four former senior executives of the Brooke corporation and its wholly-traded subsidiaries. The complaint alleges that the former executives misrepresented the health of their company's business, the number of franchisee locations and the financial condition of its franchisees. Specifically, according to the complaint:  Brooke Corporation was primarily engaged in insurance franchisor financing and insurance agency financing.&nbsp;Brooke Capital, a Kansas corporation previously headquartered in Overland Park and Phillipsburg, Kansas, was a holding company that owned and operated a majority interest in Brooke Capital&rsquo;s insurance company, which was in bankruptcy liquidation in 2008 and subsequently ceased all operations and transferred its loan servicing duties directly to its lenders and securitization trustees. In addition, as a result of these alleged misstatements and omissions, Brooke was required to write off or expense uncollectable amounts owed to investors by its many failed franchisers. Finally, because the company had few, if any, tangible assets other than profits from its ongoing operations, it was unable to make new loans to customers. By 2008, Broke Capital was so burdensome that its financial assistance to franchisiones was nearly impossible to originate any loans. It also had to borrow millions of dollars from insurance customers that were supposed to be held in trust for payment of insurance premiums to independent third-party insurance companies. They also hid Brooke's inability to timely pay funds owed by other Brooke companies and other investors. As part of this scheme, they misstated the total number and extent of Brooks Capital's loans by including failed and abandoned locations in totals, thereby concealing the true nature of those loans, including making franchise loan payments to a company subsidiary, Al","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 21957 / May 4, 2011  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3276 / May 4, 2011  SEC v.

Kansas May 4, 2011)  SEC CHARGES SIX FORMER EXECUTIVES OF THE BROOKE COMPANIES WITH FINANCIAL AND DISCLOSURE FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged six former senior executives of Kansas-based Brooke Corporation and its other, publicly-traded subsidiaries, Brooke Capital Corporation, an insurance agency franchisor, and Aleritas Capital Corporation, a lender to insurance agency franchises and other businesses, with conducting an extensive financial and disclosure fraud. The Complaint alleges that in SEC filings and other public statements for year-end 2007 and the first and second quarters of 2008, senior executives at the Brooke companies misrepresented, among other things, the number of Brooke Capital franchisees and their financial health, the deterioration of Aleritas&#8217; corresponding loan portfolio, and the increasingly dire liquidity and financial condition of the Brooke companies.  According to the SEC&#8217;s Complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, Brooke Capital&#8217;s former management inflated the number of franchise locations by including failed and abandoned locations in totals. They also concealed the nature and extent of Brooke Capital&#8217;s financial assistance to its franchisees, which included making franchise loan payments on behalf of struggling franchisees. Aleritas&#8217; former management hid the company&#8217;s inability to repurchase millions of dollars of short-term loans sold to its network of regional lenders. They also sold or pledged the same loans as collateral to more than one lender, and improperly diverted payments from borrowers for the company&#8217;s operating expenses. Aleritas&#8217; former management also concealed the rapid deterioration of the company&#8217;s loan portfolio by falsifying loan performance reports to lenders, understating loan loss reserves, and by failing to write-down its residual interests in securitization and credit facility assets.

Orr, founder and former chairman of the board of Brooke Corporation, former chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Brooke Capital, and former chief financial officer of Aleritas   Leland G.

The Complaint also alleges that Robert Orr violated Exchange Act Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3 thereunder; Robert Orr, Leland Orr, Lowry, Hess, and Garst violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; Robert Orr, Leland Orr, Hess, Garst, and Vrbas violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and aided and abetted violations by Brooke Corporation and Brooke Capital of Rule 13a-1; and Robert Orr and Hess aided and abetted violations by Aleritas of Exchange Act Rule 13a-11.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officers and director bars against each defendant, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Robert Orr, Leland Orr, and Lowry.  Robert Orr, Leland Orr, Lowry, Hess, and Vrbas agreed to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. These settlements are subject to approval by the Court. Each of the defendants consented to be permanently enjoined from violating or aiding and abetting all of the provisions that the Commission alleges they violated, and to officer and director bars.

(May 5, 2003)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced that it filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, alleging illegal insider trading in LendingTree, Inc. (""Lendingtree"") by David Anderson (""Anderson"") and his friend, Nancy D. dipietre (""Dipietor""), in advance of the May 5 public announcement that the company would be acquired by USA Interactive at a substantial premium to shareholders (""the ""Announcement""). Anderson, in breach of his fiduciary duty, provided material, nonpublic information concerning the pending acquisition to his friends, Michael J. Ricks (""Ricks""), John H. Woody (""Woody7""), and Mark P. Mead (""Mead""), each of whom could reasonably have been expected to use this information to their respective advantage. After the Announcement, Anderson's tippees, together, realized approximately $220,000 in ill-gotten gains and profits.   According to the Commission's complaint, shortly before the announcement on April 4,2003, that American Interactive was about to take over the lending-tree network, the stock price rose, and Anderson sold his shares, realizing profits of $7,895.00. Shortly thereafter, after being tipped by Anderson on the basis of this non-public, material information, he purchased shares of LendedTree common stock in two separate accounts. The Commission alleges that shortly after the acquisition was announced, as a result of ongoing negotiations and negotiations, LendTree's stock opened at $21.30 per share, up more than 44% from its previous trading day's closing price. On the morning of April 24, 2004, at approximately 10:22 a.m., Anderson attended a senior management meeting where he was instructed not to discuss the merger with anyone but his own friends and colleagues. At that time, Woody, Mead and a friend of Anderson also submitted market orders in their Charles Schwab accounts to purchase 5.000 shares. This was the largest purchase order ever placed in an account in a single day.

Securities and Exchange Commission Files Action Against Senior Vice President of LendingTree and His Tippee for Illegal Insider Trading  U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina Charges Senior Vice President of LendingTree With Obstruction of Justice, Witness Tampering, and Making False Statements    The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an insider trading complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against David N. Anderson, Senior Vice President and General Manager of LendingTree settlement services, and Nancy C. Dipietro, Anderson's close friend and former business associate. LendingTree is a financial services company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Commission's complaint alleges that, shortly before the May 5, 2003, public announcement that LendingTree was being acquired by USA Interactive at a substantial premium to LendingTree shareholders (the ""Announcement""), Anderson improperly provided material nonpublic information concerning the pending acquisition to three friends and colleagues at LendingTree &#151; Michael J. Ricks, John H. Woody, and Mark P. Mead &#151; as well as to a friend outside the company, Dipietro. The complaint alleges that Anderson's tippees then purchased shares of LendingTree while in possession of this material nonpublic information. The complaint further alleges that after the Announcement, the price of LendingTree stock soared, and Anderson's tippees made nearly $220,000 in illegal profits.  The complaint alleges that Anderson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by improperly tipping Ricks, Woody, Mead, and Dipietro with material, nonpublic information concerning the pending acquisition, and that Dipietro violated Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by trading on that information. The Commission's complaint seeks, among other things, permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits plus prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil money penalties. In addition, the Commission's complaint seeks an officer and director bar against Anderson.  The Commission previously filed and settled an insider trading case against Ricks, Woody, Mead, see SEC v. Ricks, Woody, and Mead, No. 3:04CV576 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 22, 2004)/Lit. Rel. No. 18983, and has filed insider trading cases against other individuals in connection with this investigation. See SEC v.

PIMCO Advisors Fund Management LLC, PEACAPITAL LLC f/k/a PimCO Equity Advisers LLC and PIPCO Equities Ltd., Case No.: 04-CV-3464 (SAS) (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES TWO FORMER OFFICERS OF PAFM AND PEA WITH FRAUDULENT FEDERAL FUNDS   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging two former senior executives of a hedge fund advisory firm and their principal with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants, Stephen J. Treadway, of Greenwich, Conn., and Kenneth W. Corba of Stamford, Connecticut, negotiated and approved the timing and sticky asset arrangement with Canary Capital Partners, LLC (PAFM), a broker-dealer registered with the Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, that enabled the funds to avoid market timing violations. The SEC alleges that Canary invested over $60 million in a fund called the ""Prime Growth Fund"" and invested $27 million of that fund's assets into two hedge funds: the PAP Equity Fund (the ""Investment Fund""), which received $25 million from Canary, and the Hedge Fund: Multi-Manager Series (which included the Growth, Target, Opportunity, Innovation, Select Growth and Value Funds). Canary also invested a significant amount of money into a mutual fund that was not in any way related to market-timing. In addition, Canary failed to have written policies designed to prevent the misuse of nonpublic portfolio holdings, which gave the misleading impression that the mutual fundsdiscouraged timing. To conceal Canary's actions, PAM and TREADWAY, both of them, concealed the arrangement from the investing public by, among other things, failing to disclose the Canary arrangement to investors, or by disclosing the transactions and redemptions to a brokerage firm that executed Canary trades. Canary and PAI have agreed to settle the charges against them.Â  The settlement is subject to approval by the district court. For further information, see Lit.

Treadway, the chief executive officer of PAFM and PAD as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for the PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series, and Kenneth W. Corba, PEA's former CEO, alleging violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws in defrauding PIMCO mutual fund investors, in connection with an undisclosed market timing arrangement with Canary Capital Partners LLC.  According to the complaint, from February 2002 to April 2003, Canary engaged in approximately 108 round-trip exchanges in an aggregate amount of over $4 billion in several PIMCO Funds pursuant to its special market timing arrangement. PAFM is an investment adviser for the PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series, PEA is the investment sub-adviser for several of the PIMCO Funds, and PAD is a broker-dealer that serves as the distributor for the PIMCO Funds. The Commission's complaint, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, alleges as follows.  ""Market timing"" refers to the practice of short term buying and selling of mutual fund shares.  From February 2002 to April 2003, the PIMCO Funds' advisers provided ""timing capacity"" in their mutual funds to Canary in return for long-term investments (referred to as ""sticky assets"") in a mutual fund and a hedge fund from which PAFM and PEA earned management fees.  The prospectuses for the mutual funds failed to disclose to investors that an agreement had been made to permit timing in the funds in exchange for sticky assets.  In addition, the prospectuses also gave the misleading impression that the PIMCO mutual funds discouraged timing.&nbsp; At the height of the agreement, Canary used over $60 million in timing capacity in several different mutual funds and invested $27 million in sticky assets into a mutual fund and a hedge fund.  Even as it allowed Canary to engage in this market timing activity, the distributor of the PIMCO Funds, PAD, simultaneously prevented numerous other shareholders from engaging in the same rapid trading as Canary by issuing warning letters, freezing accounts, or blocking trades.  For instance, in 2002 PAD froze nearly 400 accounts because of market timing or frequent trading in those accounts.  Finally, PEA disclosed nonpublic portfolio holdings to the broker-dealer that executed Canary's trades.&nbsp; Stephen J. Treadway, age 56, of New York, N.Y., the CEO of PAFM and PAD as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for the PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series, approved the market timing arrangement in approximately January 2002 but did not disclose his knowledge of the arrangement to the board of trustees until approximately September 2003.&nbsp; Kenneth W. Corba, age 51, of Greenwich, Conn., the former CEO of PEA, negotiated and approved the timing and sticky asset arrangement with Canary.  He was the portfolio manager for the PIMCO Growth Fund, which provided Canary with $30 million in market timing capacity, and for the PIMCO Select Growth Fund, which received $25 million in sticky assets from Canary.&nbsp;  PAFM, PEA, PAD, Treadway, and Corba are charged with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  PAFM, PEA, Treadway, and Corba are further charged with violations of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for making false and misleading portfolio disclosures.  PAFM, PEA, and PAD are also charged with violating Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder for participating in joint transactions raising a conflict of interest.  Finally, PAFM and PEA are charged with violations of Section 204A of the Advisers Act for failing to have written policies to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic portfolio holdings to Canary's brokers and others.  The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, monetary penalties, and an order pursuant to Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act preventing the defendants from serving as investment advisers, principal underwriters, officers, directors, or members of any advisory boards to any registered investment company.

According to the complaint, plus Money was the investment adviser to three purported hedge funds: The Premium Fund II, LLC, RETURN Fund III LLC and RETURNFUND V LLC.  PlusMoney and La MADRID also allegedly transferred nearly all of the funds they raised to a bank account they established in September 2007 and wired $5 million to various individuals and entities, including several real estate title companies, $95,000 toward the purchase of a car dealership. In the alternative, they transferred the money to other entities controlled by the defendants.

Benitez, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of California, issued an order on April 30 temporarily freezing the assets of the defendants and the relief defendants.  The Commission's complaint alleges that since at least May 2004, the defendants have managed hedge funds (the ""Premium Return Funds"") that raised more than $30 million from over 300 investors by telling them they would engage in a covered call options trading strategy. The complaint further alleges that, unbeknownst to investors, in the fall 2007 Plus Money and La Madrid abandoned the covered call trading strategy, emptied out the monies in the Premium Return Funds' brokerage accounts, and dissipated the money through a series of illicit transfers.  The SEC's complaint alleges that investors were not told that in the fall 2007, La Madrid and Plus Money transferred nearly all monies from the Premium Return Funds' brokerage accounts to Vision Quest Investments, a La Madrid dba, which in turn transferred $10 million to relief defendant Palladium Holding Company. The complaint further alleges that Palladium:   Transferred $5 million to its own brokerage account and used the funds to trade in numerous short-sell transactions involving Treasury bonds; as of April 25, this activity had depleted more than half of the account's value Wired $500,000 back to La Madrid Transferred $1.8 million to several real estate title companies Used $95,000 towards the purchase of two automobiles Transferred another $90,000 to a Denver-based car dealership   According to the SEC's complaint, Plus Money failed to make monthly payments to the Premium Return Funds' investors beginning in February 2008.

The court also issued orders freezing the defendants and relief defendants' assets and prohibiting the defendants from destroying documents.  Also named in the complaint as relief defendants based on their receipt of investor funds are the three purported hedge funds (The Premium Return Fund Limited-Liability Limited Partnership, The Premium Return Fund II Limited-Liability Limited Partnership, The Premium Return Fund III Limited-Liability Limited Partnership); six entities created by Plus Money (Return Fund, LLC, Return Fund II, LLC, Return Fund III, LLC, Return Fund IV, LLC, Return Fund V, LLC, Return Fund VI, LLC); Donald Lopez of Denver, Colo.; and Palladium Holding Company, an entity formed and controlled by Lopez.  The Commission's complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, return of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and penalties against the defendants. The complaint also alleges that the defendants transferred significant amounts of investor monies to the relief defendants and seeks the return of those monies.

According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants purchased call options on the common stock of Swiss parent company CNS Inc. (CNS) on September 28 and 29 and sold the options for profits of approximately $499,696. The Commission alleges that the stock price rose by more than 28% after the announcement.

The First Amended Complaint alleges that Kohler purchased out-of-the-money call options in CNS in his personal account and in an account in the name of Swiss Real Estate, a company controlled by Kohler, based on material non-public information relating to the company's potential acquisition.  The Commission alleges that Kohler and Swiss Real Estate realized illicit gains of approximately $387,566. The Commission further alleges that Kohler tipped his wife and his brother-in-law, who then traded in CNS options in advance of the announcement of the acquisition of CNS and realized significant illicit gains.  The First Amended Complaint also names Sacho Todorov Dermendjiev (Dermendjiev) as a relief defendant.  The Commission alleges that Dermendjiev, who resides in Bulgaria, was the beneficial owner of banking and securities accounts over which Kohler held power of attorney.  According to the First Amended Complaint, Kohler purchased option contracts on CNS stock for Dermendjiev's account just prior to announcement of the acquisition of CNS and sold these options immediately after announcement of the CNS acquisition, resulting in illicit gains of $74,655 for Dermendjiev.  According to the First Amended Complaint, Kohler has engaged in a pattern of highly suspicious trading both prior to and immediately after the trades in CNS securities that are charged in the First Amended Complaint.  During late 2005 and 2006, Kohler and a group of his friends and relatives also traded in the securities of five other public companies in advance of acquisitions or earnings announcements.  The First Amended Complaint alleges that Kohler and his circle of traders realized over $5 million in profits on these trades.  In the pending lawsuit, the Commission alleges that Kohler and Swiss Real Estate engaged in illegal insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The First Amended Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.

S. Department of Justice, charging Mississippi based Tuba-based Tulse Land Co. with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and related provisions of federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that from 2001-2006, the company made payments valued at approximately $43,000 (including cash, payment of travel and hotel expenses, air conditioners, computers, office furniture and refrigerators) to multiple officials at the Turkish Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs (MOA). The payments were made in order to obtain governmental reports and certifications necessary to purchase the cotton seeds from Turkish farmers. In a number of cases, MOA inspectors did not actually inspect the fields prior to completing inspection reports, as they were required to do. Finally, according to the complaint, in 2006, when the payments came to light in connection with due diligence being performed by a potential acquirer of Delta and another potential acquisitionr, they failed to maintain adequate internal controls sufficient to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements.

First, on July 25, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Delta & Pine and Turk Deltapine with violating the FCPA and seeking a civil penalty.  Second, on July 26, the Commission issued an administrative order finding that Delta & Pine violated the books-and-records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and that Turk Deltapine violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.  In the administrative proceeding, the Commission ordered the respondents to cease and desist from such violations, and required Delta & Pine to retain an independent consultant to review and make recommendations concerning the company's FCPA compliance policies and procedures.  In the federal lawsuit, Delta & Pine and Turk Deltapine agreed to the entry of a final judgment requiring them to pay jointly and severally a $300,000 penalty.  Delta & Pine was acquired on June 1, 2007 by Monsanto Company; the conduct charged by the Commission occurred prior to the acquisition.

In a parallel action filed in federal court on August 27, 2013, U. S. District Judge William M. Jeffries entered a temporary restraining order enjoining Melvin from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Melvin has consented to a permanent injunction, to which he will be permanently enjoined from further violations and to pay disgorgement of approximately $6,020, which represents Melvin's total illicit profits from unlawful trading in his personal securities holdings. On the same day that the preliminary injunction was entered, an independent board member informed Melvin that it was ""willing to consider"" a potential acquisition at Chattom, but that he would not be able to do so without the knowledge and consent of Melvin. At the time he disclosed this information to his longtime accountant and tipped another individual who also traded, Rook received a benefit from trading","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22469 / September 4, 2012  SEC v. R. Jeffrey Rooks, Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-02988-CAP, United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia  SEC Charges Griffin, Georgia CPA with Insider Trading  On August 28, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the Northern District of Georgia against R. Jeffrey Rooks (âRooksâ), a Griffin, Georgia based CPA. The Commission alleges that Thomas D. Melvin (âMelvinâ), a Griffin, Georgia based CPA and partner of Rooks, disclosed material non-public information about the pending tender offer for Chattem, Inc. (âChattemâ) securities to Rooks. The Commission also alleges that Rooks tipped one other individual. The Commission further alleges that Rooks traded in the securities of Chattem based on that material non-public information and caused the other individual to also trade.  According to the Commissionâs complaint, on December 21, 2009, Sanofi-Aventis (âSanofiâ), a French pharmaceutical company, announced its intent to make a tender offer for Chattem, a Tennessee-based distributor of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, at the price of $93.50 per share (âAnnouncementâ). Shares of Chattem closed 32.60% higher on the day of the Announcement than the prior trading dayâs close of $69.98 and volume increased more than 3,000% to 10.3 million shares.  The Commission alleges that in early December 2009, several weeks before the Announcement, an independent board member of Chattem who owned Chattem options that would automatically exercise in the event of an ownership change at Chattem, initiated a series of confidential conversations and meetings with his longtime accountant, Melvin, to discuss potential methods of ameliorating the effect of an acquisition of Chattem on his tax liability. The Chattem board member told Melvin sufficient facts such that, given Melvinâs knowledge of the board memberâs affairs, Melvin would have clearly known that the board member was discussing Chattem. Melvin and the Chattem board member also discussed the price impact of the tender offer on the board memberâs options.  The Commission further alleges that Melvin misappropriated material non-public information regarding the impending tender offer for Chattem securities. Within days of his first meeting with the board member, Melvin disclosed material non-public information about the impending tender offer to Rooks. Rooks traded in Chattem securities based on the material non-public information disclosed by Melvin, and Rooks caused another individual to trade based on that information.  Rooks has agreed to settle the Commission claims against him by consenting to the entry of a final judgment providing permanent injunctive relief under Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and by agreeing to pay disgorgement of $18,482.14, prejudgment interest of $1,432.68, and a penalty of $4,620.54. The terms of Rooksâ settlement reflect credit given to him for his cooperation and substantial assistance to the investigation. Rooks neither admits nor denies the Commissionâs allegations, and his settlement is subject to court approval.

One or More Unknown Purchasers of Call Options for the Common Stock of TXU Corp., Defendants, Civil Action No.: 1:07-CV-00796-JVS (N.D. Ill.)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court in Chicago against one or more unknown purchasers in connection with highly profitable and suspicious purchases of call option contracts for common stock of Texas Pacific Group, a New York based private equity firm. The Commission's complaint alleges that these purchases were made in advance of a public announcement (the ""Announcement"") on February 26,2007, that TXUS had executed a merger agreement with two private-equity groups headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs. As a result of the Announcement, the stock price increased more than 13% over its previous trading day closing price, placing the unknown buyers in a position to gain substantial profits.  According to the complaint, at the time of their illegal trading, approximately $4.7 million in trading profits had been made from the illegal purchases. In a parallel action, on March 3, 2008, Judge James B. Berkowitz entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against the defendants, including an order freezing their assets, prohibiting the destruction of documents, imposing a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and imposing civil penalties of $150,000 and a penny stock bar, for a total of over $5.3 million. On February 23, an unknown purchaser purchased 6,700 call options contracts through an omnibus account at Credit Suisse in Zurich, Switzerland, which in turn executed the purchase orders through the facilities of UBS AG London. Following the announcement, Houston, Texas-based KKR and its broker-dealer, Goldrnan Sachs & Co., cleared the trades through several foreign brokerage firms, clearing the purchases through their domestic brokerage accounts and thereby securing more Than $6.5 million of illegal profits from illegal insider trading.

STOCK PRIOR TO ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT  Orders Placed From Foreign Accounts Just Prior to $45 Billion Acquisition Announcement; as much as $5.4 Million Frozen    On March 2, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago, entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets of certain Unknown Purchasers of Call Options for the common stock of TXU Corp. (""Unknown Purchasers""). The Commission's complaint alleges that the Unknown Purchasers engaged in illegal insider trading, in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to freezing approximately $5.4 million in assets, the Court's order (i) requires that the Unknown Purchasers identify themselves, (ii) provides for expedited discovery, and (iii) prohibits the defendants from destroying evidence.  The Commission's complaint alleges that highly profitable and suspicious purchases of call option contracts for the common stock of TXU Corp. were placed by the Unknown Purchasers through overseas accounts in late February 2007. These purchases were made in advance of a public announcement (the ""Announcement"") on February 26, 2007, that TXU had executed a merger agreement with private equity groups headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of the Announcement, TXU's common stock jumped more than 13% over its previous trading day closing price, placing the Unknown Purchasers in a position to gain substantial profits.  The Commission further alleges that between February 21 and February 23 - prior to the public disclosure of the merger agreement - while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding this acquisition offer, the Unknown Purchasers, using overseas accounts, purchased over 8,020 call option contracts for TXU stock in accounts at three broker-dealers in the United States. As the complaint alleges, the call option contracts were ""out of the money"" and most were set to expire in March, within weeks of the purchase date. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the increase in price of TXU stock following the Announcement, the unrealized illicit profits on these option contracts total approximately $5.4 million. The Commission alleges that the Unknown Purchasers in this case engaged in insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil monetary penalties.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least March 2017, Pierre ran an investment club called the Amongst Friends Investment Group. Investors, who were largely Haitian New Yorkers, received ""Investment Promissory Note"" (the ""Notes"") promising unrealistically high returns of 5% per month (60 percent per annum) plus profit sharing of 40% of the franchise's gross operating profits (Franchise Agreements).  The complaint alleges that, instead of generating profits as promised,Pierre sustained significant trading losses that he needed to make the interest payments to earlier investors in order to pay the Franchise investors the promised returns. The SEC also alleges Pierre used money that Pierre stole from a former employer to fund his fraudulent scheme, which resulted in losses of approximately $1.2 million in investor funds.

From at least March 2017, Pierre allegedly raised over $2 million from at least 100 investors, predominately Haitian New Yorkers, who purchased high-yield promissory notes through Amongst Friends.  As alleged, Pierre induced investors by promising unrealistically high rates of return of at least 20% every 60 days.  In reality, the complaint alleges that Pierre incurred heavy losses trading securities and concealed them by using new investor funds to pay older investors and issuing false account statements showing investment gains.  Pierre allegedly further financed the fraud by using money that he embezzled from a former employer to make interest payments to investors.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Pierre fraudulently raised at least $375,000 from more than 15 investors related to a scheme involving the sale of partnership interests in a fast food chain.  In or about November 2018, Pierre began to sell partnership interests in a fast food franchise, with agreements that falsely guaranteed monthly returns of 10% (60% per year) plus quarterly profit sharing.  As alleged, at the time he sold these interests, Pierre knew that the franchise could not provide sufficient profits to pay investors the promised returns.  The SECâs complaint, filed in Federal District Court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Pierre with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Wilmington Trust Company, Civil Action No., 4:04-CV-422 (D. Del.)   The Securities and Exhange Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the federal district court for the District of Delaware against Wilmington Trade Company (Wilmington Trust) for its non-compliance with certain key recordkeeping and reporting requirements under federal securities laws in connection with its transfer agent operations. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least October 2000 through July 2003, Wilmington was required to maintain a master securityholder file and a control book for each security issue for which it provided transferagent services. As a result of Wilmington's failure to do so, the company failed to report any aged record differences that existed at the end of each calendar year, without limitation by any monetary threshold, or to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Wilmington also did not file required annual reports with the FDIC, its appropriate regulatory agency, and its own audit committee concerning the adequacy of its internal accounting controls for transferring agent functions. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Wilmington has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17A(d)(1) and Rules 17Ad-11(a), (c), and (d) thereunder, ordering it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of these provisions and from any future violations and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty. In a related administrative proceeding, on June 5, 2005, a Delaware federal court entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief in an emergency action brought by the Commission in response to an SEC enforcement action filed by Wilmington in July 2005. This action is the first of a series of actions that the SEC has taken in recent months to halt an ongoing investigation into the matter. Among other things, these actions arise from the discovery of significant differences between the amounts of principal and assets of certain issuers and the amount of related securities that Wilmington had transferred agent services to. For example, in 2000 and 2001 Wilmington reported a total of approximately $5.8 billion in aged records differences for certain issues, which Wilmington failed timely to reconcile against","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 18759 / June 23, 2004  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. WILMINGTON TRUST COMPANY, Civil Action No. 04-CV-422 (D. Del.)  SEC CHARGES WILMINGTON TRUST COMPANY WITH VIOLATIONS OF TRANSFER AGENT RULES  WILMINGTON TRUST AGREES TO PAY $125,000 PENALTY  On June 23, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a complaint seeking a $125,000 penalty against Wilmington Trust Company (Wilmington Trust) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Wilmington Trust violated certain key recordkeeping and reporting requirements while acting as a registered bank transfer agent.  Wilmington Trust consented to the imposition of the penalty without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Wilmington Trust Corporation.  According to the complaint, between September 2000 and July 2003, Wilmington Trust failed to maintain current and accurate master securityholder files for the debt securities for which it acted as transfer agent.  In particular, the complaint alleges that Wilmington Trust did not verify that the actual payments it processed were accurately recorded in the master securityholder files.  By January 2003, almost 2,000 recordkeeping items on Wilmington Trust's master securityholder files, totaling in excess of $5.8 billion, had not been reconciled against the actual payments processed.  Wilmington Trust also did not reconcile the principal balances in the master securityholder files with those in the control book.  When Wilmington Trust ultimately reconciled its records, it found 17 active debt issues for which the principal balances in the master securityholder files differed from those in the control book by approximately $185 million.  The complaint alleges that although these record differences did not represent any actual cash payment errors or financial loss to any issuers or shareholders or to Wilmington Trust, they did represent recordkeeping errors that, in many instances, had existed for one or more years.  The complaint further alleges that Wilmington Trust failed to timely report these aged record differences to the issuers or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and failed to disclose the aged record differences in its Forms TA-2.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Wilmington Trust failed to either provide reports to its Board of Directors or the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors or file an independent accountant's report with the FDIC and Commission concerning the adequacy of the internal accounting controls for its transfer agent operations.  The complaint alleges that as a result of the conduct described above Wilmington Trust violated Section 17A(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17Ad-10(a), 17Ad-10(b), 17Ad-11(b), 17Ad-11(c), 17Ac2-2 and 17Ad-13 thereunder.  The Commission also simultaneously entered a cease-and-desist order prohibiting Wilmington Trust from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of these recordkeeping and reporting requirements in a related action before the Commission.  Wilmington Trust consented to the entry of the cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the findings of the order.  The Commission thanks the FDIC for its assistance in this matter.

Streiner with conducting a fraudulent scheme to conceal the company's prior criminal fraud conviction from third parties.  According to the SEC's complaint, between 2012 and 2017, Nerlinger and his four control persons solicited and sold securities for the purpose of concealing his role as a de facto officer or control person of Giga, a company that provided cable television to customers in and around Roanoke, Virginia. The complaint further alleges that the defendants made material misstatements to existing and potential investors regarding the marketing campaign for SELFEO, another mobile device application that was featured on the Apple App Store. As alleged in the complaint filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, from May 2016 until early 2017 GIGA, under the direction of the control group, made false and misleading statements to investors about the growth of downloads and the high ranking the app achieved in Apple's app store. In addition, according to a complaint by the Commission, N.Y.-based software developer Gary ""Nerlinger"" Silver (""Silver"") and CFO Alfred ""Alfred"" Coluci (""Colucci"") lied when asked by a prospective underwriter, respectively, about their role in running the scheme. Finally, in a communication to an investor in November 2016, Silver allegedly overstated the number of ""user acquisition"" downloads by at least 300% in connection with the fraud, which he later admitted to in an effort to hide from investors the fact that he had been convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to six months in prison for securities fraud in 2013 and 2014.

According to the SEC's complaint, between February and August 2016, the company bought at least 559,662 downloads from outside marketing firms to boost the profile of the company's mobile app, SELFEO. These firms provided Giga with a shortcut to propel its app to the top of the Apple Store download rankings. But instead of disclosing the real cause of the app's artificial meteoric rise, the company misled its shareholders into believing that this success was due to traditional marketing tactics like billboards and radio advertisements. The complaint alleges that when the company stopped paying for downloads in August 2016, the app's rankings on the Apple Store plummeted. Rather than come clean about the fact that the spike in downloads was a result of paid download campaigns, the company, Nerlinger, Streiner, and Colucci lied and told shareholders that the number of downloads continued to grow at the same high rate. Further, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, and Noska lied and falsified documents to conceal Nerlinger's role as Giga's de facto CEO to prevent the investors from discovering his prior criminal conviction for mail fraud.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, charges: (i) Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, and Colucci with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Noska with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Streiner with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and aiding and abetting Giga's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder; and (iv) Giga with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the findings, Giga, Nerlinger, Silver, Colucci, Noska, and Streiner consented to the entry of an SEC order finding that they violated the antifraud provisions, and a finding that Giga violated registration provisions of the federal securities laws.

Furman, and Harvey Braun, Civil Action No.: 04-CV-1388 (SAS) (SDW)  SEC CHARGES ASSOCIATES OF CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY WITH FRAUDULENT SALES OF SOFTWARE  On November 11, 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California charging a La Jolla, California-based company and its former chief executive officer with fraud and other violations of the antifraud, issuer reporting and record-keeping, books and records and internal controls provisions of federal securities laws. The Commission's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2004, Island Pacific, which was headquartered in Irvine, Calif., engaged in a fraudulent scheme to overstate its financial results by recording revenue from a sham software transaction with an Australian software company, QQQ Systems Pty Ltd, in order to artificially inflate the company's revenues. According to the complaint, during the period of this fraudulent accounting scheme, defendants Barry Schechtter and his wife Ran Hurman caused the Company to improperly record and report $3.9 million in revenues from the sham transaction. In fact, no contract finalizing the offsetting transaction was signed until the fourth quarter of 2004. As a result of these improper accounting maneuvers, Islands Pacific overstated its net income by 140% and gross profit by 214%, respectively, by overstating its revenue by approximately $6.7 million. Additionally, as the Complaint alleges, Fisher-Price, a California resident and self-employed, was a controlling person and defacto officer of IslandPacific and controlled a substantial number of its shares.

SEC Sues Island Pacific and Former CEOs and CFO for Accounting Fraud Scheme  Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against Retail Pro, Inc. (formerly known as Island Pacific, Inc.), and two former CEOs and a former CFO for their roles in an accounting fraud scheme designed to falsely inflate Island Pacific's revenues. The Commission's lawsuit, filed in federal district court in San Diego, Calif., names Retail Pro, Inc., a La Jolla, Calif. software company, Barry M. Schechter, age 54, of La Jolla, Calif., Ran H. Furman, age 39, of San Diego, Calif., and Harvey Braun, age 69, of Livingston, New Jersey. Island Pacific, Schechter, and Braun have agreed to settle the charges.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Schechter, the former CEO, Furman, the former CFO, and Braun, another former CEO, caused Island Pacific to improperly record and report $3.9 million in revenue from a barter transaction. As alleged in the complaint, the barter transaction had little economic purpose or business substance aside from manipulating Island Pacific's financial statements. The complaint further alleges that as a result of improperly recognizing and reporting the $3.9 million as revenue, Island Pacific overstated its revenues by 140% for the second quarter of 2004, 29% for the nine months ending the third quarter of 2004, and 22% for the 2004 fiscal year. In addition, Island Pacific reported a small profit instead of a massive loss for the second quarter of 2004.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to disclose the barter nature of the transaction and actively concealed their fraud from Island Pacific's outside auditors and the public by creating forged and backdated documents in an attempt to show that recognizing revenue from the transaction was proper. In addition, the complaint alleges that Schechter sold 637,750 shares of Island Pacific stock for more than $1.5 million during the fraudulent scheme.  To settle the Commission's charges, Island Pacific, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  To settle the Commission's charges, Schechter, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, internal controls, and lying to the accountants provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder and aiding and abetting Island Pacific's reporting violations; ordering him to pay disgorgement of $488,410 in ill-gotten gains from his stock sales during the fraud, prejudgment interest of $27,437, and a civil penalty of $120,000; and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of ten years. Schechter, who was Chartered Accountant in South Africa, also consented, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, to entry of an administrative order that makes findings and suspends him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.

D.C. filed April 1, 2007)  SEC Charges Los Angeles-Based Broker-Dealer With Violating Section 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  The Commission announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that, from at least January 1999 through April 2007, a broker-dealer registered with the Commission failed to establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information by its employees and associated persons.  According to the complaint, the firm violated the antifraud, internal controls, books and records, and internal control provisions contained in its securities registration. The complaint further alleges that from 1999 to September 15, 2003, when the brokerage firm was acquired by Duff &amp; Phelps, an investment bank headquartered in New York, Dallas, London and London, it had no written policies, procedures, training materials, or training for its personnel on its insider trading policies or procedures. In addition, as a result, its compliance program was inadequate and its procedures were inadequate. Finally, in October 2006, after the acquisition of that financial advisory firm by a third-party, Chan-in deregistered as an broker, which was not required to comply with its own rules and regulations. Without admitting or denying the allegations in today's complaint filed in federal district court in Washington, U. S. District Judge Frederick J. Bates III granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an order appointing a receiver to preserve and marshal assets, prohibiting the destruction of documents and preventing the alteration of records. Among other things, Bates ordered the company to cease and desist from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordered it to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $7,500 and a one-year officer-and-director bar, for an amount to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of a motion filed on April 2, 2006.Chanin has agreed to settle the matter by consenting","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20551 / May 1, 2008  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

Chanin, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&#8217;s complaint, has consented to the entry of the proposed final judgment against it, which orders it to pay a $75,000 penalty.    The complaint alleges that, between January 1999 and September 2003, Chanin had certain written policies and procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information, but failed to enforce them.  In September 2003, and again in 2004, Chanin revised its written policies and procedures.  While its adherence to its own policies improved after September 2003, Chanin continued to lack policies and procedures reasonably designed to address the continued maintenance and enforcement of its new compliance program.  Chanin ceased functioning as a broker-dealer on or about October 31, 2006, and de-registered as a broker-dealer effective April 1, 2007.    In a related administrative proceeding, A. Carlos Martinez (Martinez), Chanin&#8217;s compliance officer during the period, consented to the entry of a Commission Order against him, without admitting or denying any of the findings in the Order except as to the jurisdiction of the Commission over him.  The Commission&#8217;s Order finds that Martinez, who was responsible for implementing and enforcing Chanin&#8217;s compliance and insider trading policies, willfully aided and abetted and caused Chanin&#8217;s failure to implement, maintain or enforce its own written policies and procedures prior to September 15, 2003, and its failure to adequately implement, maintain or enforce its policies and procedures after September 15, 2003.  The Commission&#8217;s Order censures Martinez, orders him to pay $25,000 pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, and orders him to cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Section 15(f).

Gallivan, Case No: 05-CIV-0457 (SDLC) (SAS)  SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA BANK PROFESSIONAL WITH INSIDER TRADING AND TIP-INS IN CONNECTION WITH BROTHERS' MERGER SCHEMES  On September 19, 2004, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against a California-based securities law recidivist and bank-owned life insurance (""BOLI"") sales representative for his role in five separate mergers that occurred over a one-and-a-half year period.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from July 2002 through December 2003, a sales agent associated with the C&amp;B Consulting Firm, which provided compensation and benefits consulting services to California community banks, obtained material, nonpublic information regarding the securities of five California communities banks involved in merger transactions: Valencia Bank 8 Trust (""Valencia""), Monterey Bay Bank (""Monterey""), Sun Country Bank (Sun Country), Mid Valley Bancorp (Mid Valley), and Harbor National Bank. According to the complaint, in certain transactions, Gallagher obtained information from a member of the board of directors of one of these banks to recommend the purchase of stock of Valencia. The complaint further alleges, among other things, that the stock price on the basis of this information was significantly higher than it had been in prior years. In addition to his duties as a BOLi sales rep and consulting on these transactions and his compensation consulting consulting duties, he also allegedly tipped several friends and relatives of his to trade on this confidential information, including his own wife, cousin, son-in-law, and a friend who resides in Minnesota. As a result of trading in Valencia stock, his trading profits totaled approximately $8,636.

Gallivan With Insider Trading in the Securities of Five California Community Banks  Gallivan Agrees to Pay $338,000 to Settle Charges    The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") today filed an insider trading complaint against Robert J. Gallivan (""Gallivan"") of Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California, alleging that over a 17-month period during 2002 and 2003, Gallivan violated the federal securities laws by serially purchasing, and/or recommending that friends and relatives purchase, the securities of five California community banks after learning material, nonpublic information regarding the proposed acquisition of each of these banks.  The Commission's complaint alleges that:    Prior to the public announcement of proposed mergers involving Valencia Bank & Trust (announced August 6, 2002), Monterey Bay Bank (announced April 8, 2003), Sun Country Bank (announced April 30, 2003), Mid Valley Bank (announced September 16, 2003) and Harbor National Bank (announced December 1, 2003), Gallivan obtained nonpublic information that each of the five banks was engaged in negotiations to be acquired.&nbsp;  Gallivan obtained the merger information concerning Valencia, Monterey and Mid Valley through his position as a bank-owned life insurance sales representative with a compensation and benefits consulting firm that had sold insurance to these banks. Gallivan learned of the Valencia and Monterey mergers when consulted by the merging banks, and he learned of the Mid Valley merger when told by his employer that Mid Valley had made a request for merger-related benefits calculations. As to Sun Country and Harbor, Gallivan obtained the information in his capacity as a longtime friend and confidential adviser on California community banks to a prominent private investor negotiating to buy these banks. Gallivan had a duty to keep all of the merger information confidential.&nbsp;  On the basis of this material, nonpublic information, Gallivan bought Valencia, Monterey and Sun Country stock, in breach of his duty to maintain the confidentiality of the information. Gallivan personally profited by a total of $51,963 from his unlawful trades.&nbsp;  Gallivan also unlawfully recommended that friends and relatives purchase stock in Valencia, Monterey, Mid Valley and Harbor. Gallivan's friends and relatives collectively profited by $54,748 from their trades in these bank stocks.   Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gallivan has agreed to pay a total of $338,000, consisting of: (1) $106,711 in disgorgement of illegal profits from his trading and that of his friends and relatives, (2) $17,867 in prejudgment interest, and (3) a civil penalty of $213,422, equal to two times the total illicit profits. Finally, he also has consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, which are antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to approval by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  In a separate matter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California today filed criminal charges against Gallivan with respect to his trading and/or recommending that others trade in the securities of four of the community banks. Gallivan entered a guilty plea to four counts of securities fraud regarding purchases made in Valencia, Monterey, Sun Country and Harbor stock.  ***  The Commission's investigation that led to these actions was conducted in cooperation with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducted their own separate, parallel investigation.

Securities and Exchange Commission Settles Securities Fraud Charges Against North Carolina Resident in Connection With a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) Offering by CompuDyne Corporation  On June 15, 2007, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Carolina, charging John ""Mangan"" J. ""Hugh"" McColl, III, a resident of Charlotte and a registered representative of FBR, with engaging in unlawful insider trading and unregistered sales of securities in connection with a private investment in public equity offering by the company.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, beginning in September 2001, Murnahan learned material, non-public information concerning the PIPPE offering from his employment as a sales staff member at a Charlotte-based broker-dealer, which was the placement agent for this offering. According to the complaint, on the basis of this information, and in breach of duties of trust and confidence, he traded in shares of Compudyne common stock in advance of the public announcement on October 9, 2001. As a result of his improper trading, Mangon reaped approximately $56,937 in ill-gotten profits. The complaint further alleges, in a parallel action, that F BR, an Arlington, Virginia-registered broker dealer, failed to disclose the price at which the shares would be offered to investors. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fbr consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Mangan, Jr., Civil Action No. 06-CV-531 (W.D.N.C.)  SEC Charges Former Registered Representative and Hedge Fund Manager John F. Mangan, Jr., With Unlawful Insider Trading and Unregistered Sales of Securities in Connection With CompuDyne Pipe Offering    On December 28, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a complaint against John F. Mangan, Jr. (Mangan) in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina alleging that Mangan committed unlawful insider trading by short selling securities of CompuDyne Corporation prior to the public announcement of a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering. The complaint also alleges that Mangan engaged in unregistered sales of securities. At the time of the relevant conduct, Mangan was a registered representative of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., Inc. (FBR), a registered broker-dealer and the placement agent for the PIPE offering. Mangan executed his alleged illegal trades through the account of HLM Securities, LLC (HLM), which was an account of his business partner, Hugh L. McColl, III (McColl III).  The Commission's complaint alleges that in the fall of 2001, Mangan, on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning the PIPE offering, and in breach of duties of trust and confidence, traded in CompuDyne stock in advance of the public announcement of the CompuDyne PIPE offering and its terms. As a result of his unlawful insider trading, Mangan reaped $56,937 in ill-gotten gains.  The complaint further alleges that after the public announcement of the PIPE offering, Mangan continued short selling CompuDyne stock. After the resale registration statement became effective, Mangan used the shares that HLM obtained in the PIPE offering to cover all of the short sales. By short selling CompuDyne securities before the effective date of the resale registration statement for the CompuDyne PIPE shares, and covering the short sales with the shares HLM received from the PIPE offering, Mangan effectively sold HLM's PIPE shares prior to their registration. As a result of Mangan's unregistered sales of CompuDyne stock, he obtained an additional $121,933 in ill-gotten gains. Mangan split the profits he earned from his improper trading with McColl III.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Mangan's short selling of CompuDyne shares prior to the public announcement of the PIPE offering violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Mangan violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by short selling CompuDyne shares prior to the effective date of the resale registration statement for the PIPE shares and covering those short sales with the shares HLM purchased in the PIPE offering. The complaint also alleges that the Commission has named McColl III solely as a relief defendant in that action, in connection with his receipt of trading profits from Mangan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, McColl III has consented to the entry of a final order, subject to the court's approval, requiring McColl III, solely as a relief defendant, to pay a total of $115,643.

SEC CHARGES MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT MANAGER WITH FRAUDULENT SCHEME  The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Marcus Luna, a Nevada-based securities law violator, and four other individuals for their roles in a multi-million dollar scheme that raised approximately $6.88 million from November 2006 to December 2007.  According to the Commission's complaint, from October 2006 through October 2007, Luna and his cohorts, Nathan Montgomery, Adam Daskivich and David Murtha, created and sold several corporate entities in Minnesota and Nevada that purported to be accredited investors. The complaint alleges that, in reality, none of the entities had any legitimate business operations. Instead, the defendants allegedly sold their unregistered stock into the public market and made millions of dollars in illegal profits by selling the stock to unsuspecting investors and then selling it to unaccredited investors who were not registered to buy the company's stock at the time. As a result, they received ill-gotten gains totaling $2.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of their illegal stock sales and the proceeds of Luna's scheme, which were paid out to investors in the form of kickbacks and other undisclosed profits. In addition, as a condition of participating in this fraudulent scheme Luna failed to meet the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, including Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

(""Matrix VC"") for their roles in a multi-million dollar scheme and for selling shares of Axis Technologies Group, Inc. stock in a public distribution without registration with the Commission.The Commission's complaint alleges that:Luna drafted and issued a legal opinion letter to a transfer agent that falsely stated the shares of Axis were unrestricted because they were issued pursuant to a valid exemption from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D.Luna further misrepresented that St. Paul VF, Minnesota VC, Real Estate MN and Matrix VC were accredited investors in Minnesota, and claimed that Minnesota state law permitted an exemption allowing accredited investors to purchase unrestricted shares from Axis.These entities were not accredited investors, and moreover were simply conduits for distribution of the stock to the public. Soon after these alleged accredited investors received their shares, they transferred shares to promoters and sold the remaining shares to the public.Luna, Montgomery, Daskivich and Murtha received profits totaling $6.88 million from St. Paul VF, Minnesota VC, Real Estate MN and Matrix VC sales of their shares of Axis stock.The Commission's complaint alleges that Luna violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Luna, Montgomery, Daskivich, Murtha and their entities violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The Commission's complaint seeks from Montgomery, Daskivich, Murtha, St. Paul VF, Minnesota VC, Real Estate MN and Matrix VC: (1) a permanent injunction; (2) disgorgement of profits, including prejudgment interest; (3) a civil penalty; and (4) a penny stock bar.

SEC CHARGES FLORIDA-BASED FINANCING AND INVESTMENT COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPALS WITH INSIDER TRADING  On August 2, 2000, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against a Florida-based financial services company and its principal, Anthony ""Tony"" Blissetset, for engaging in insider trading in violation of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. The Commission's Complaint alleges that, from at least 1997 through the present, Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate investor funds for their personal use, to pay personal expenses, and to make payments to certain individuals and entities. According to the complaint, defendants have misrepresented to investors that their funds would be used to fund the company's operations. In fact, as alleged, they have not invested the money as required by federal law. As part of their scheme, BlissBotet and his companies have misappropriated more than $1.5 million from investors, including approximately $600,000 from the sale of jewelry and other personal items. These defendants are also alleged to have been in possession of confidential information that was provided to them by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Blisset has consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13a-13 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(e), 14(d), and 17(f) (U.S.) and (c) Securities Act Section 15A and Rule 13e-3.

Financing and Investments, Inc. and Anthony Blissett, Case No. 02-23487-CIV-UNGARO-BENAGES (S.D. Fla., filed December 6, 2002)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that on December 6, 2002, it filed an emergency action to halt an affinity fraud conducted by Miami-based A. B. Financing and Investments, Inc. (""A. B. Financing"") and its principal, Anthony Blissett (""Blissett""), that has raised at least $31 million.  According to the SEC's Complaint, the affinity fraud targeted African Americans, and has been ongoing since at least 1998.  Also on December 6, 2002, Judge Ursula Ungaro-Benages, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, issued various emergency orders against the defendants, including temporary restraining orders, asset freezes, and orders that they repatriate investor assets that have been sent overseas.  The SEC's Complaint alleges that A. B. Financing and Blissett falsely guarantee to investors and potential investors that A. B. Financing will generate a 30%, risk- and tax-free annual return on their investment.  According to the SEC's Complaint, Blissett entices potential investors to invest with A. B. Finance by claiming that he can offer them an opportunity to make the type of investments, and corresponding profits, that have thus far been offered only to ""whites"" or select African Americans.  The defendants also falsely represent that A. B. Financing has over $36 million in assets, when, according to the SEC's Complaint, its financials and its federal income tax return for 2001 actually reflect a negative net worth of over $27 million.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that, although A. B. Financing and Blissett claim to generate returns for investors by making investments in, among other things, real property and securities that are insured, in reality the speculative stock and real estate purchases that A. B. Financing and Blissett have made with investor proceeds have lost millions of dollars and do not provide safe or guaranteed returns.   According to the SEC's Complaint, investor losses from A. B. Financing's securities trading alone were nearly $2.5 million as of 2001.  Moreover, the real estate assets purchased using investor funds are illiquid and most are encumbered by mortgages.  As a result, the SEC alleges, the defendants have conducted a typical Ponzi scheme by using proceeds that are coming in from new investors to make interest payments to existing investors.   The SEC's complaint charges A. B. Financing and Blissett with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Those sections and rules prohibit certain transactions in securities not registered with the Commission, prohibit fraud in the offer and sale, and in connection with the purchase and sale, of securities, and prohibit investment advisers from defrauding clients.  The complaint also name Blissco Properties, Inc., Jamrock Market Place, Inc. and Carribean Cultural Art & Exhibition Centre, Inc. as relief defendants three companies controlled by Blissett that have received investor funds.  Investors are advised to read the SEC's ""Affinity Fraud"" Investor Alert, which provides tips on how to avoid being a victim in an affinity fraud.

Cal., filed October 12, 2006)  SEC Charges Former Officers of Riverstone Networks, Inc. with Financial Fraud    The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it has filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against five former officers and one former employee of Riverstone Networks, Inc. (""Riverstone""), a California-based company that, until recently, was a worldwide provider of communications routers, as a result of their roles in a scheme to inflate Riverstone's net revenues.   The complaint alleges that, from June 2001 through June 2002, chief executive officer Romulus S. Pereira, chief financial officer Robert B. Stanton, executive vice president of sales L. John Kern, vice president of marketing Andrew D. Feldman, vice president of finance William F. McFarland, and director of sales operations Lori H. Cornmesser negotiated, reviewed, approved, or were otherwise aware of sales transactions for which Riverstone improperly recognized revenues in contravention of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Specifically, Riverstone improperly recognized revenues on sales transactions that involved side agreements with purchasers, under which the customer's payment for Riverstone product was contingent upon resale or the purchaser was granted full return, exchange, or cancellation rights. Due to the defendants' actions and omissions, the side agreements were concealed from Riverstone's outside auditors. Riverstone reported almost $30 million of fraudulent revenues as a result of these contingent sales, causing revenue overstatements in four fiscal quarters ranging between 14.3 and 23.1 percent. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, the defendants also circumvented Riverstone's internal accounting controls, falsified Riverstone's accounting records, and lied to Riverstone's outside auditors.   The Commission's complaint charges Pereira, Stanton, Kern, Feldman, and McFarland with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges various defendants with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against First United Financial Group, Inc. (""First United""), a financial services firm based in Carlsbad, Maryland, and its principals Robert Hall, Jr. and Carletus Willis.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least June 2001 until August 2003, the defendants offered and sold securities titled ""Asset Placement Agreements"" in unregistered transactions to over 150 investors in 18 states and the Caribbean and raised more than $1.38 million from approximately 50 of these investors. The Commission alleges that the Defendants made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning, among other things, their use of investor funds and expected returns. In particular, they misrepresented and failed to disclose the true financial condition of the company, which was operating out of a bank account in Washington, DC, at the time of its alleged fraudulent conduct. Among other alleged misstatements, Hall and Willis made numerous false excuses, including, but not limited to, suggesting errors by the bank, promising to make the agreed payments upon the future sale of properties and claiming that investor proceeds had been stolen. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b), 13(d), and 15(e) of The Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, imposing civil penalties and imposing penny stock bars against each of them and ordering a permanent injunction against future violations of those provisions, with the disgorgement amount to be determined at a later date upon a motion by a federal district court in which the Court will hold a hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against further violations, as well as an order appointing a receiver over the assets of each defendant and prohibiting the destruction of any evidence.","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No.   18886 / September 15, 2004  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. FIRST UNITED FINANCIAL GROUP, LLC, CIV. ACTION NO. 04-1601 (United District Court for the District of Columbia) (Judge Kotelly)  SEC CHARGES DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC OFFICIAL AND OTHERS WITH OPERATING A PONZI SCHEME  On September 15, 2004, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, against First United Financial Group, LLC, Robert L. Hall, Jr., and Carletus Willis, alleging that they defrauded customers by operating a ""Ponzi"" scheme.    Hall, 32, is a District of Columbia resident, and was the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of First United.  Hall is Chairman of D.C. Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6C, an elected DC governmental position.   First United is a Washington, DC limited liability corporation incorporated in 2001.  In promotional materials sent to investors, First United purported to be a ""multi-million dollar DC based [financial services] consulting firm.""  Willis, 30, is also a Washington, DC resident and was the Chief Operating Officer of First United from May 2001 to November 2002.   The Commission's Complaint alleges that, from at least June 2001 until August 2003, the defendants offered and sold securities called ""Asset Placement Agreements"" in unregistered transactions to more than 150 investors in at least 18 states.  Through cold calls, seminars, sales agents and newspaper advertisements, First United raised over $1.38 million.  In connection with the offer and sale of securities, according to the complaint, Hall and Willis made misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor funds, expected returns, and the investment risks, including the following.   The Asset Placement Agreements offered fixed rates of return as unrealistically high as 15% per month or 180% per year. First United, Hall and Willis represented that the investment did not pose any risk to investors' principal.   First United, Hall and Willis represented that investors' pooled funds would be invested in real estate in Washington, DC to assist lower and moderate income residents in a ""friendly real estate development system"" to assist residents who might be displaced ""by the market pressures of gentrification.""  In fact, the defendants invested no funds in real estate projects in Washington, DC or elsewhere. First United, Hall and Willis used most of the funds invested to pay the ""capital gains"" of earlier investors, and dissipated the remaining funds in personal use and in paying the alleged operating expenses of First United.  The defendants did not inform investors that their funds would not be invested in real estate but instead would be used to pay the ""capital gains"" of earlier investors.   First United, Hall and Willis issued misleading account statements to investors misrepresenting returns on investments that did not exist.   The Commission alleges that the proposed defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties from each of the proposed defendants.  The Commission also seeks a permanent conduct-based injunction enjoining Hall from participating in any sale or offer of any security in an unregistered transaction.   The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter.

Frank A. Dunn, Douglas C. Beatty, Michael J. Gollogly, Mary Anne E. Pahapilla, James B. Kinney and Kenneth R. W. Taylor, Civil Action No.: 07-CV-2058 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES FORMER CFO OF NORTEL NETWORKS CORP. WITH FRAUDULENT RECORDS AND MISAPPROPRIATION SCHEME  The Commission today announced the filing of an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, from at least July 2002 through the first half of 2003, three former senior executives of Nortel Networks Corporation (Nortel) engaged in a fraudulent accounting scheme, a revenue fraud scheme and an earnings management scheme.  According to the SEC&#8217;s amended Complaint, the defendants accelerated material amounts of revenues into 2000 and caused the company to report materially false and misleading financial results in order to meet the unrealistic revenue and earnings guidance that its top executives had provided to Wall Street in 2000, and again in 2002 and 2003. The SEC alleges that the scheme resulted in two separate accounting schemes, one of which was led by Dunn and Beaty and the other by a third (but different) corporate executive and four business unit executives, which were at the center of the fraud. In both schemes the former executives improperly established, maintained and released billions of dollars in excess reserves to improve the revenue recognition performance of North America-leading telecommunications and internet companies. As a result of their misconduct, Dunn was terminated for cause in April 2004 and was ordered to pay a total of more than $1.2 million in bonuses to himself and other executives and employees. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 12(j), 13(d)(2)(A), and 13 (b)(6)(B).

Taylor, Civil Action No. 07 CV 2058 (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC Charges Four Additional Former Officers of Nortel Networks Corporation in Financial Fraud Scheme    The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four more former officers of Nortel Networks Corporation with engaging in accounting fraud by manipulating reserves to manage Nortel's earnings. The Commission filed an amended complaint in SEC v. Dunn, et al., Civil Action No. 07 CV 2058 (S.D.N.Y.), to add as defendants Douglas A. Hamilton, Craig A. Johnson, James B. Kinney and Kenneth R.W. Taylor, who were the former vice presidents of finance for Nortel's Optical, Wireline, Wireless and Enterprise business units, respectively. The Commission's original complaint, among other things, charged three former corporate officers of Nortel &#8212; CEO Frank Dunn, CFO Douglas Beatty and Controller Michael Gollogly &#8212; with directing the earnings management fraud.  Among other allegations, the amended complaint alleges that Hamilton, Johnson, Kinney and Taylor engaged in the following misconduct:   From the second half of 2002 through January 2003, Hamilton, Johnson, Kinney and Taylor all determined that their business units held tens of millions of dollars in excess reserves. The four finance vice presidents did not immediately release those excess reserves as required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), but instead maintained them for earnings management purposes.&nbsp;  In early January 2003, during the 2002 year-end closing process, Hamilton, Johnson, Kinney and Taylor acted on orders received from former executives Dunn, Beatty and Gollogly and improperly established over $44 million in additional excess reserves in order to lower Nortel's consolidated earnings and bring it in line with internal and market expectations. Their efforts helped erase Nortel's pro forma profit for the fourth quarter of 2002 and caused it to report a loss instead.&nbsp;  In the first and second quarters of 2003, Dunn, Beatty and Gollogly directed the improper company-wide release of approximately $500 million of excess reserves specifically to inflate earnings and pay bonuses. These efforts turned Nortel's first quarter 2003 loss into a reported profit under US GAAP, largely erased Nortel's second quarter loss and generated a pro forma profit in the second quarter. The efforts of Hamilton, Johnson, Kinney and Taylor were essential to creating these false results because the four vice presidents improperly released approximately $154 million in reserves in the first quarter of 2003, and approximately $191 million in reserves in the second quarter.   The amended complaint charges Hamilton, Johnson, Kinney and Taylor with violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission seeks a permanent injunction, a civil monetary penalty, an officer and director bar, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against each of these defendants.  In its original complaint, filed on March 12, 2007, the Commission alleged that (1) Dunn, Beatty and Gollogly learned that the Company was carrying massive amounts of excess reserves and then directed the alleged reserve manipulations to meet earnings targets, fabricate profits and pay performance-related bonuses, and also (2) that Dunn, Beatty and former Assistant Controller MaryAnne Pahapill altered Nortel's revenue recognition policies from late 2000 through January 2001 to accelerate revenue to meet publicly announced revenue targets.

Devlin, et al., Civil Action No.: 09-CV-1188 (SDNY)  SEC Files Settled Charges Against Former Lehman Broker-Dealer for Misappropriating Nonpublic Information  On September 26, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging a former broker-dealer and two of his clients with insider trading based on nonpublic information he received from his wife.  The Commission's complaint alleges that over a four year period, from at least March 2004 through July 2008, Matthew Codelman, a registered representative at Lehmann Brothers, Inc. (""Lehman""), traded on and tipped his wives and friends with inside information about 13 pending corporate transactions involving publicly traded companies.

Corbin, 32, who is a self-employed attorney and a resident of Boca Raton, Fla., engaged in trading on behalf of their clients in connection with the deals. According to the complaint, in each instance, he misappropriated the confidential, non-public, information that he obtained from the wife or husband of one of her clients. As a result, they reaped more than $4.8 million in illicit profits. In a parallel action, on September 27, 2009, Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of each defendant and appointing a receiver over the defendants' assets and any assets under the control of a federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y. and ordered the relief defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,072, which will be deemed satisfied by the restitution ordered against him by a court-ordered administrative proceeding entered earlier this month.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of FINRA and the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20831 / December 18, 2008  SEC v.

Corbin, LLC and Checa International, Inc., relief defendants, Civil Action No. 08-CV-11001 (S.D.N.Y.) (JGK)  SEC Charges Wall Street Professionals and Others with Widespread Insider Trading  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against nine defendants and also named three relief defendants. The Commission's complaint alleges that from at least March 2004 through July 2008, Matthew Devlin, then a registered representative at Lehman Brothers, Inc. (""Lehman"") in New York City, traded on and tipped at least four of his clients and friends with inside information about 13 impending corporate transactions. According to the complaint, some of Devlin's clients and friends, three of whom worked in the securities or legal professions, tipped others who also traded in the securities. The complaint alleges that the illicit trading yielded over $4.8 million in profits.  As alleged in the complaint, although many of the defendants had accounts with Lehman, they often attempted to avoid detection by trading in the securities of the target companies in numerous accounts that were not associated with Lehman or Devlin. The complaint alleges that to further conceal their illicit trading, at least two of the defendants sold off some of the shares they had purchased based on inside information prior to public announcements of the deals. In addition, Devlin and one of his tippees arranged to buy shares on Devlin's behalf so Devlin could profit from the nonpublic information but evade scrutiny. When this tippee's name appeared on a watch list, Devlin and the tippee agreed that Devlin would stop providing him inside information.  The complaint alleges that Devlin misappropriated the confidential nonpublic information about the corporate transactions from his wife, a partner in the New York City office of an international public relations firm working on the deals. As alleged in the complaint, because the inside information was valuable, some of the traders referred to Devlin and his wife as the ""golden goose."" The complaint further alleges that by providing inside information, Devlin curried favor with his friends and business associates and, in return, was rewarded with cash and luxury items, including a Cartier watch, a Barneys New York gift card, a widescreen TV, a Ralph Lauren leather jacket and Porsche driving lessons.  The complaint alleges that, based on the information provided by Devlin, the defendants variously purchased the common stock and/or options of the following public companies: InVision Technologies, Inc.; Eon Labs, Inc.; Mylan, Inc.; Abgenix, Inc.; Aztar Corporation; Veritas, DGC, Inc.; Mercantile Bankshares Corporation; Alcan, Inc.; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.; Pharmion Corporation; Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; Anheuser-Busch, Inc.; and Rohm and Haas Company. At the time that Devlin tipped the other defendants about these companies, each company was confidentially engaged in a significant transaction that involved a merger, tender offer, or stock repurchase.  The Commission's complaint contains the following additional allegations:  Bouchareb Trading Group   Devlin tipped Jamil Bouchareb, age 27, his friend and client at Lehman about 12 of the deals. Bouchareb, a Miami Beach, Florida-based trader, traded in his own accounts and tipped his friends and business partners. He also caused his parents to trade.   Bouchareb's tippees include his friend and business partner, Daniel Corbin, age 32, who traded in a number of the deals through accounts in the name of his companies, Augustus Management LLC and Corbin Investment Holdings LLC. Corbin, a Miami-based trader, shared some of the profits he made with Bouchareb. Bouchareb and Corbin also shared an interest in a number of accounts that traded in the deals. In turn, Daniel Corbin, provided the information to his father Lee Corbin, age 66, an attorney based in White Plains, New York. Lee Corbin traded in his personal accounts in four of the deals and owned an interest in the Corbin Investment Holdings account that Daniel used to trade in the deals. Bouchareb and Corbin introduced Devlin to Lee Corbin, who steered Devlin business from some of his trusts and estates clients. Bouchareb also provided the information to his girlfriend, Maria Checa, age 38, who currently resides in Greensboro, North Carolina. Checa traded in her accounts, Checa International, Inc. and Playmate Capital LLC. Bouchareb shared in some of the profits that Checa made. In total, Bouchareb, Daniel Corbin, Lee Corbin, Maria Checa and Bouchareb's parents reaped illegal profits of more than $4.2 million.   Devlin's Other Tippees   Frederick Bowers, age 40, a registered representative at Lehman and one of Devlin's work partners was tipped on at least three of the transactions. Bowers then tipped Thomas Faulhaber, one of Bowers' clients at Lehman. Faulhaber realized profits of approximately $217,000. Faulhaber kicked back cash to Bowers who shared some of it with Devlin. Devlin received at least $10,000.  Eric Holzer, age 34, Devlin's friend and a tax associate in the New York City office of an international law firm, traded in at least three of the transactions. Holzer reaped profits of $175,000 in his own accounts and two accounts controlled by his father. Holzer gave Devlin cash, some of which came from shares he had his father buy on Devlin's behalf.  Jeffrey Glover, age 46, another of Devlin's Lehman clients and an investment adviser, traded in at least five of the deals. Glover, who is a resident of Bellaire, Texas, made approximately $189,000 in illicit profits.    Defendants Devlin, Bouchareb, Daniel Corbin, Bowers, Faulhaber, Holzer, Glover, Corbin Investment Holdings, LLC and Augustus Management, LLC are charged with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Defendants Checa, Checa International, Inc. and Lee Corbin are charged as relief defendants and the SEC seeks their trading profits.

The complaint alleges that, in May 2016 and August 2016, the company's then-CFO opined on two occasions that the notes the Company offered and sold likely were not securities. In the second opinion, Atlas knowingly falsified or omitted important facts, including how the note would be used and the fees it would charge investors.

Atlas, while a partner at a Fort Lauderdale-based law firm that was acting as outside counsel to 1 Global, drafted two opinion letters in which he knowingly falsified or omitted important facts and offered the opinion that 1 Global's notes likely were not securities.  The complaint alleges that 1 Global used the opinion letters to falsely represent to a network of external sales agents that its notes were not securities and that its offering did not have to be registered with the SEC.  1 Global then allegedly induced thousands of retail investors to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in its notes.  According to the complaint, Atlas received a percentage of the commissions generated on the sale of 1 Global's notes, which totaled more than $600,000.

Pope, Chet Inglis, Matthew Leaverton, William Hill, Erik Rhodes, and Robert Gilliam with defrauding hundreds of investors out of more than $10 million in connection with various securities offerings conducted for the purported purposes of drilling oil and gas wells and drilling-related equipment.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least May 2013 through August 2016, defendants operated a limited liability company called Texas Energy Mutual, LLC (""TEM""), which offered and sold investments in oil-and-gas drilling programs and promissory notes. The complaint alleges that the defendants sold the securities through a combination of high-pressure and deceptive sales pitches and false and misleading offering materials. In addition, according to The Complaint, these defendants misappropriated investor funds, spending them on such things as dating websites as a dating website, luxury international vacations and payments to disgorge investors to prevent complaints. Finally, The SEC alleges, that, as part of their scheme, TEM failed to disclose its control person and the company's apparent authority at the time, including that of its then-de facto head of sales and that it did not have a registered broker-dealer and had no jurisdiction to issue securities to certain investors. As a result of the conduct described in the complaint and in its complaint filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas:   The defendants raised approximately $11.5 million from investors in Texas through two fraudulent offerings, known as ""Thunderhead"" and ""Miner Interest Lease Program"" (MILP). The offerings were purportedly to invest in natural gas, oil, gas and mineral interests, but no such investments were actually ever actually offered.&nbsp;  In the Thunderhead program, investors were promised a 10% annual return and full repayment within three years of investment, while the MILP program was purportedly a multi-year investment with guaranteed annual returns of up to 10%.  As alleged, in both programs, each unit cost $120,000 and consisted of a 3.33% working interest and 2.4% net revenue interest. Investors were told that their money would be used to develop the wells, when in fact the money was used for other purposes, such as to pay for dating site expenses, travel expenses and other personal expenses. Instead, they spent it on other expenses as well as on luxury","The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Texas resident James VanBlaricum and six others for running an oil and gas Ponzi scheme.  The SEC's complaint alleges that VanBlaricum was the driving force behind a company called Texas Energy Mutual, LLC (f/k/a Texas Energy Management).  Because he was a securities fraud recidivist with a history of running fraudulent schemes, the complaint also alleges that VanBlaricum convinced Rodney Pope and Chet Inglis to serve as the face of the company.  Together, they enlisted Robert Gilliam, Matthew Leaverton, William Hill, and Erik Rhodes to solicit investors.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the defendants raised over $10 million by guaranteeing investment returns and promising investors that their funds would be used to drill oil wells.  Instead, the defendants used investor money for a variety of personal expenditures, including luxury international vacations and wedding expenses.  According to the complaint, VanBlaricum created a ""special needs"" program to keep dissatisfied investors from discovering the fraudulent conduct.  The defendants allegedly lulled investors with cash Ponzi payments that purported to be a return on their investment or rolled over investors from a failed drilling program to a newer one.

SEC CHARGES FORMER FUND MANAGER IN FRAUDULENT SCHEME   On September 24, 2010, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the former portfolio manager of the Seaside Partners Fund. The Commission's complaint alleges that, between at least as early as September 2004 and March 2010 the fund had four to six investors, including two funds of funds that each had 35 investors. Among other things, Duncan misappropriated the Fund's assets and used them to pay for personal expenses, falsified the account statements that he sent to accountants, and fabricated the documents that purported to be its audited financial statements. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, on September 25, 2011, a federal district court in Atlanta entered an order freezing the defendants' assets, appointing a receiver for Duncan and ordering the repatriation of assets held by the Commission. In a related administrative proceeding, an administrative order was entered against Duncan on October 30, 2012, in connection with the filing of a civil injunctive action against him in federal court for securities fraud and other violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206 (2), and 206 of Investment Advisers Act. According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in Federal Court in Athens, Georgia, from September 2005 through 2010 Duncan raised approximately $4.5 million from investors through a short-term trading fund known as the ""Seaside Fund."" The Fund retained an accounting firm to prepare monthly statements for each of its funds, which Duncan sent. Contrary to his representations to investors and/or to clients that the funds were invested in equities and short positions, however, he used investor funds to purchase a Maserati for himself and a Mercedes for his wife. As a result of his fraudulent scheme, his account balances and assets were overstated by over 40%.

SEC FILES SETTLED PONZI SCHEME INVOLVING $50 MILLION   The Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against three individuals and two companies they controlled: BBC Equities, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company formed in May 2006 with its principal place of business in Southfield, Michigan, and its sole owner, Antonio M., a resident of Brighton, Mich.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least 2006 through the present, the defendants used investor proceeds to finance their lavish lifestyles, pay for luxury homes, cars, jewelry, gambling, exotic vacations and luxury cars. The complaint also alleges that the Defendants used new investor funds to pay earlier investors and for their own personal benefit, including to purchase a $90,268 Ferrari, which was worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than the initial investors' initial investment. In addition, according to a complaint filed in federal district court in Detroit, defendants have spent investor money on personal expenses, such as rent and mortgage payments on homes and car payments, luxury vehicles, entertainment, travel, retail, health care, casinos, limousine rentals and to fund the solicitation of other investors. As a result of the alleged scheme, investors were left with little or no money to invest and their money was used to support their lifestyles and perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all three defendants agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting, denying, or admitting liability, for violations of Sections 17(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1), (2), and 207(4)-1 of Investment Advisers Act Rule 206A-1 and Rules 206-2 and 206a-3 there under.

Lawson of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against John J. Bravata (John Bravata) of Brighton, Michigan, Richard J. Trabulsy (Trabulsy) of Northville, Michigan, BBC Equities, LLC (BBC Equities) and Bravata Financial Group, Inc.

Bravata (Antonio Bravata), John Bravata's son, and John Bravata's wife, Shari A. Bravata (Shari Bravata), a Relief Defendant.  The SEC alleges that Bravata and Trabulsy raised more than $50 million from at least 440 investors by offering them membership interests in a purported real estate investment fund with promised annual returns of 8 to 12 percent. The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants told prospective investors that BBC Equities was a real estate investment fund and safe investment vehicle. However, the SEC alleges that no more than $20.7 million of the more than $50 million raised since May 2006 through the sale of membership interests in BBC Equities was actually spent on real estate acquisitions. Furthermore, this real estate portfolio is highly leveraged with mortgages and other liabilities exceeding $128 million, and BBC Equities has never been profitable.  The SEC alleges that John Bravata and Trabulsy spent approximately $7.2 million of investor money for their own personal benefit. In order to keep their scheme afloat, they paid out $11.3 million in Ponzi payments by using new investment proceeds to pay distributions to earlier investors. They also spent $14 million soliciting and marketing the offering in order to continue the scheme.  The SEC's complaint charges John Bravata, Trabulsy, and Bravata Financial with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint charges BBC Equities with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.

The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief and disgorgement from all of the Defendants, and civil penalties from John Bravata, Trabulsy, and Antonio Bravata. The SEC's complaint further seeks disgorgement of all investor funds or assets acquired with investor funds from Relief Defendant Shari Bravata.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, between November 2002 and November 2003, while he was the company's stock option administrator, he created false entries in his brokerage account to create and then hide the options grants to his wife, Robin (""Colls"").  According to the Complaint, when the fraudulently issued shares became available for trade in an individual account with the broker-dealer, which was registered as a joint account at the time of his sales, DonLAN used Equity Edge and related software to issue and transfer the stock to Colls, who then sold the shares on the open market. The complaint further alleges, in connection with this fraudulent conduct, Donnelly and Collis made approximately $7.2 million in net proceeds through the sale and exercise of these fraudulent securities, and the proceeds from their unauthorized sale of those securities were used to purchase a home, a car, bank, broker, or credit card company and to pay for real estate. Accordingly, during the relevant time period, however, DONlan had primary responsibility for entering the information about the companies' options distributions into the software program that he used. Through the use of this software, Dolan created fictitious names of real people who were not registered to be registered with a brokerage firm and/or transfer their stock into their brokerage accounts. As a result of their fraudulent activity, WFC cancelled the remaining shares it had issued that day, realizing the ill-gotten gains of $6.9 million.

According to the complaint, Donlan caused these transfers by making false entries in WFI's stock options software to create and then hide the unauthorized stock options grants to Colls, and by providing false information to WFI's brokerage firm and transfer agent.

Daniel Fongnien Chiang and Eva Yi-Fen Chen, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action Number 05-CIV-11-13-MEL (D. D.C.)  SEC CHARGES DANIEL FONGNEN CHIANG AND HIS WIFE WITH INSIDER TRADING  On February 21, 2006, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Washington, DC, charging Daniel ""Chiang"" of Taiwan with insider trading.  The Commission's complaint alleges that in late 2005, Daniel, then a co-chairman of SINA Corporation (""SINA""), aided and abetted by his spouse, Eva Chen Chen (""Chen""), directed the short sale of 70,000 shares after learning of two events that would negatively impact the company's 2005 first quarter revenues and likely end its pattern of consistent improvements to its quarter-over-quarter revenue results. At the time of the long sale, news of this revenue decline was both material and non-public. According to the complaint:   In February 2004, Sina received notice from the Chinese State Administration of Radio, Film and Television that it instituted a new billing policy. The likely effect was that the revenue would be reduced by as much as twenty to thirty percent, resulting in a twelve to eighteen percent decline in total revenues for that quarter.&nbsp;  Between January 26, 2004 and February 1,2005, Chen learned of these changes and, with her knowledge and consent, directed SineC to cancel the transaction. Chen replied that no one in her family had any relationship with S.INA. Three days later, at 9:20 a.m. on February 7, she received an e-mail from an attorney representing her husband, who was a client of her mother who lived in Taiwan. In response to her inquiry, which was conducted in the market and settled by the broker-dealer at the close of business on March 3, he directed her to surrender her short position in an account controlled by her and to allow him to sell the shares in advance of a public release of negative financial performance projections. She did so without disclosing the fact that she knew or recklessly disregarded Chen's involvement in this conduct.

The Commission's complaint alleges that on February 4, 2005, Chiang participated in a SINA Board of Director's meeting where he learned confidential information that SINA was going to disclose lower than expected revenue projections. On the morning of February 7, 2005, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence owed to SINA, Chiang, with the assistance of Chen, positioned himself to profit from a drop in SINA's stock price by placing eight separate orders to sell short 200,000 shares of SINA securities in Chen's mother's account. Due to the limited buying power in the account, ultimately, four orders totaling 70,000 shares of SINA were sold short in the account.

(filed September 29, 2001)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against three former officers and directors of a San Francisco-based penny stock company. The Commission's complaint, filed on September 27, alleges that the former officer and director of the penny stocks company, William Henrick, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the value of his company's common stock by artificially inflating the price of its stock, thereby causing the company to overstate its publicly-traded share price by as much as 30%.  According to the Complaint, Henick and his co-defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in connection with the scheme, including:   (1) making false and misleading statements concerning the safety and performance of Henck's stock; (2) the use of investor funds to pay for his own personal expenses; and (3) engaging in fraudulent accounting practices that artificially inflated the stock's price and liquidity.&nbsp;  In a parallel action, the Commission filed an enforcement action against Henrik, who was charged with fraud and with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206, 206(1), and 207 of The New York Stock Exchange, which is charged by the SEC with securities fraud. In its complaint filed in federal district court in Santa Ana, Calif., Henricks has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 13(d)(1)(A), 13b2-1, 13a(2)(B), 16b3-2 and 16d-3, as well as to paying disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $3.5 million and a civil money penalty.

Beck, and Kevin P. Clark, Civil Action No. C-02-4105 (BZ) (N.D. Cal.) (August 27, 2002)  SEC CHARGES THREE MORE FORMER CRITICAL PATH EXECUTIVES WITH PARTICIPATING IN FINANCIAL FRAUD  Two of the Executives Are Also Charged with Insider Trading in Company Stock During the Fraud  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced new developments in its investigation of the financial fraud at Critical Path, Inc., a California company that provides e-mail services.  In a civil action filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the Commission charged three additional former Critical Path executives with fraudulently participating in the scheme to inflate the company's revenues and earnings for fiscal 2000.  Named in the new complaint are William H. Rinehart, 38, the former head of Critical Path's North and Latin America sales forces; Jonathan A. Beck, 33, a former vice president of sales at Critical Path; and Kevin P. Clark, 37, a former regional vice president of sales at the company.   The complaint also charges Beck and Clark with insider trading in Critical Path stock during the financial fraud.  Rinehart and Clark have reached settlements with the Commission.  Also today, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced criminal charges against Beck and Clark.  In April 2001, Critical Path restated its financial results for the third quarter 2000 and revised previously-announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2000.   Earlier this year the Commission instituted and settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Critical Path (Exchange Act Release No. 34-45393) and filed a settled civil injunctive action against Critical Path's former president David A. Thatcher and a former vice president of sales, Timothy J. Ganley (Litigation Release No. 17353).  The Commission also suspended Thatcher from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant (Exchange Act Release No. 45683).  The complaint filed today alleges that during 2000 and early 2001 William Rinehart directed his sales force to arrange certain transactions for which Critical Path improperly recorded revenue of approximately $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.  Two of these transactions were fictitious.  Rinehart issued side letters that allowed a third customer, in its sole discretion, to terminate a transaction with Critical Path.  In early 2001, Rinehart signed a letter to Critical Path's auditors that stated falsely that all of the company's sales were bona fide.  Jonathan Beck participated in one of the fraudulent transactions, for which Critical Path improperly recorded revenue of approximately $2.125 million.  Kevin Clark also participated in certain of the fraudulent transactions, for which the company improperly recorded revenue totaling approximately $2.15 million.    The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beck illegally sold 27,348 shares of Critical Path stock and Clark illegally sold 16,325 shares based on non-public information they possessed about the fraud and the company's true financial condition.  By selling shares while the fraud was underway, Beck avoided losses of $586,368 and Clark avoided losses of $343,140.  Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission's complaint, and without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Rinehart and Clark consented to the entry of final judgments imposing the relief detailed below.  Rinehart consented to:     A permanent injunction from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;   Payment of a $110,000 civil penalty for his participation in the financial fraud; and   A five-year bar from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  Clark consented to:   A permanent injunction from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act;   Payment of $378,912 ($343,140 in disgorgement plus $35,772 prejudgment interest).

Joseph Milanowski, Civil Action No 2:08-cv-00511 (D. NV)  SEC Charges Former President of USA Commercial Mortgage Company, USA Capital, With Fraudulent Offering of $150 Million   The U. S. Securities Exchange today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against Joseph ""Joe"" Milowski of Las Vegas, Nevada. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Nevada, alleges that from approximately May 2000 to September 2005, Milano raised over $100 million from 1,900 investors through a fraudulent offering of securities. According to the SEC, the offering was intended to provide investors with a diversified portfolio of interests in real estate loans, but investors lost over half of their investments.  As a result of the misuse of investor money and the large number of defaulted loans the Fund raised, it was unable to repay the investors' principal and principal. In addition, as alleged, in its offering documents and in a monthly account statement filed with the court on April 21, 2007, and on its website, ""USA Capital Securities LLC,"" the fund raised $962 million, net of redemptions, from about 6,800 investors, including investors in California, Utah and Connecticut. Most of these investors invested their money in securities that were not secured by a trust deed, rather than by real property. To avoid the loss of principal, investors were required to transfer their funds to a bank-appointed receiver, which would then immediately transfer the funds back to their bank accounts. Additionally, due to this conduct, many of those funds became non-performing, defaulting on principal payments made to other investors. Finally, some funds were invested in ""First Deeds of Trust,"" which represented that the money would be used to make mortgage loans to various borrowers, when in fact the loans had been foreclosed on by the lender. Moreover, because the loan was unsecured, its principal was never transferred to another bank and was instead paid to an entity that was not affiliated with any of its business partners.

As alleged in the complaint, contrary to the representations to the Fund investors, Milanowski used the vast majority of the Fund's offering proceeds to make unsecured loans to entities affiliated with him, which entities eventually defaulted on the loans. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of Milanowski's misuse of the Fund's money and the large number of defaulted loans, USA Capital, certain of its affiliates, and the Fund filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2006, and Fund investors lost over half their investments.  The Commission charged Milanowski with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

119,"On October 18, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Yuhe International, Inc. and its Chief Executive Officer, Gao Zhentao, with securities fraud for making false statements concerning a purported acquisition for more than $15 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, from approximately December 2009 to June 2011, YUHE, a China-based company, misled investors by disseminating false information about the acquisition in a conference call with investors and by failing to disclose material facts concerning the purchase of thirteen farms from a private company owned by the company's then-CEO. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of this conduct, YuHE's stock price dropped by 70 percent, and the CEO was forced to resign from his position at the end of the trading day, giving the false impression that the deal had been completed and that he had taken full responsibility for it. In a parallel action, on December 21, 2012, NASDAQ delisted the stock, which was subsequently issued a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendants.

Specifically, the complaint alleges that between approximately December 2009 and June 2011, Yuhe misled its public investors by disseminating a series of materially false statements concerning a purported acquisition of additional chicken farms for more than $15 million, often providing updates concerning the farms' integration and contribution to the company's revenue.

SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Action Against Former Seattle Genetics Manager and a Closer to Disgorgement  On January 20, 2012, the Commission filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against a former manager of clinical programming at Seattle-based biopharmaceutical company, Russell Genetics, Inc.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, alleges that, beginning in at least August 2010, a manager at the company learned positive clinical trial results for a cancer drug under development, and tipped a relative who purchased stock and options in his brokerage account. The complaint alleges the relative tipped the information to a friend, who then purchased several hundred thousand dollars of the stock. When Seattle reported to the public in late September 2010 that its flagship drug, brentuximab vedotin, had proven effective in fighting Hodgkin's lymphoma, its stock price jumped nearly 18% and the defendants netted more than $803,000 in illicit profits, according to SEC filings. On Jan. 19 the date of filing the SEC's enforcement action, it has obtained an emergency court order halting the alleged insider trading and freezing the assets of both defendants and relief defendant Junhua Fan. In addition, on January 21 the court entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and an expedited discovery to preserve the status quo in which the traders are alleged to have obtained their trading profits. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties; and imposing a permanent officer-and-director bar against each of them for five years from trading in securities that are subject to court approval; imposing an officer and director bar for each defendant; requiring each to pay a civil penalty of $25,500; prohibiting trading on the basis of material nonpublic information; barring any alteration or omission of facts; ordering all defendants to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of Sections 5(a),","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 21820 / January 21, 2011  Zizhong Fan and Zishen Fan, Defendants and Junhua Fan, Relief Defendant, Civil No. 2:11-cv-00096-MJP (W.D. Washington, filed January 19, 2011)  SEC FREEZES ASSETS IN BIOTECH INSIDER TRADING CASE  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing the bank and brokerage accounts controlled by an individual who made more than $800,000 in illegal profits by trading on inside information tipped to him by an employee of a Seattle-area biopharmaceutical firm. In a complaint unsealed late Thursday by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the SEC alleges that Zizhong (James) Fan, a manager at Seattle Genetics, told family member Zishen (Brandon) Fan about confidential positive trial results for the company's flagship cancer treatment. Zishen spent hundreds of thousands of dollars purchasing speculative stock options in the company as well as common stock, which skyrocketed in value when the news became public in late September 2010.  According to the SEC's complaint, the SEC staff contacted both Zizhong and Zishen last Thursday, January 13. Almost immediately after being contacted, Zishen attempted to wire several hundred thousand dollars to a bank in China while Zizhong informed his employer that he was leaving unexpectedly for China. The SEC thereafter filed an emergency enforcement action. On Wednesday, January 19, Judge Marsha J. Pechman of the Western District of Washington issued an order freezing brokerage and bank accounts containing the Seattle Genetics trading proceeds.  The SEC's alleges that Zizhong Fan, who lives in Bothell, Wash., was employed during 2010 as the manager of clinical programming at Seattle Genetics. He was involved in clinical trials for a development-stage product to be used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. As Zizhong Fan began learning information about the success of those trials, Zishen Fan, who lives in Chino Hills, Calif., began amassing large quantities of risky stock options that would allow him to profit from a rise in the company's stock price.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on Sept. 24, 2010 &#8212; the day that Zizhong attended a series of meetings to finalize the results for presentation to the company's senior executives &#8212; Zishen made his largest options purchase to date (over 50 percent of the options trades in the entire market), while also buying $150,000 in stock. The next business day &#8212; September 27 &#8212; Seattle Genetics reported the positive results to the public, and its stock price rose nearly 18 percent. According to the SEC, Zishen ultimately realized net trading profits of more than $803,000.  The SEC's complaint charges Zizhong Fan and Zishen Fan with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest, and monetary penalties. The SEC also named another family member Junhua Fan, who resides in the People's Republic of China, as a relief defendant in the case. His brokerage account was used by Zishen to make many of the illegal trades, according to the SEC's complaint.  The SEC thanks the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority for its assistance in this matter. The SEC also acknowledges the cooperation of Seattle Genetics.

Ohio) (December 21, 2005)  SEC Sues NCFE Executives for Role in $2.6 Billion Fraud  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging that Lance Poulsen, principal and former Chief Executive Officer of National Century Financial Enterprises, Inc. (NCFE), Donald S. Ayers, principal and former Chief Operating Officer of NCFE, Rebecca S. Parrett, principal and former Director of NCFE's Accounts Receivable Servicer Department, and Randolph H. Speer, former Chief Financial Officer of NCFE, participated in a scheme to defraud investors in securities issued by subsidiaries of NCFE, NPF VI and NPF XII (""the Programs"").  The complaint alleges that NCFE, a private corporation located in Dublin, Ohio, through wholly owned subsidiaries purchased medical accounts receivable from health-care providers and issued notes that securitized those receivables.  From at least February 1999 to October 2002, the subsidiaries offered and sold at least $3.25 billion in total notes through fifteen private placements to institutional investors.  In October 2002, NCFE suddenly collapsed when investors discovered that the companies had hidden massive cash and collateral shortfalls from investors and auditors.  The collapse caused investor losses exceeding $2.6 billion and approximately 275 health-care providers were forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  The complaint further alleges that pursuant to the representations in the offering documents and the Program agreements, the Programs were required to maintain certain reserve-account balances and medical accounts receivable as collateral to secure the notes.  Nevertheless, Poulsen, Parrett, Ayers and Speer depleted the Programs' reserve accounts and collateral base by ""advancing"" at least $1.2 billion from the Programs' funds to health-care providers without receiving eligible receivables in return.  These advances were essentially unsecured loans by the Programs to distressed or defunct health-care providers - many of which were wholly or partly owned by NCFE, Poulsen, Parrett and/or Ayers.  According to the complaint, Poulsen, Parrett, Ayers and Speer concealed their fraud from investors and others by: (1) repeatedly transferring funds between the subsidiaries' bank accounts to mask cash shortfalls of as much as $350 million; (2) recording $1 billion or more in non-existent or ineligible medical accounts receivable on the subsidiaries' books; (3) creating and distributing false offering documents, false monthly investor reports, and false accounting records to trustees, investors, potential investors, and auditors; and (4) misrepresenting the status of the Programs' cash accounts and collateral base to investors and others.  In the complaint, the Commission seeks to: (1) permanently enjoin each Defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; (2) permanently bar each Defendant from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (3) order each Defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty, in amounts to be determined.  The Commission has obtained judgments against three other former NCFE executives: Sherry Gibson, former Executive Vice President of Compliance of NCFE; John Snoble, former Vice President and Controller; and Brian Stucke, former Associate Vice-President for Business Services.  Each of these individuals has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting them from violating the federal securities laws; an order barring him or her from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined.  Moreover, each of these three former NCFE executives has pled guilty in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio to criminal charges arising from the scheme to defraud.  Gibson pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and was sentenced to four years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  Gibson is currently serving her prison sentence at the Lexington Federal Medical Center in Kentucky and is scheduled to be released on March 28, 2008.  Stucke pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and Snoble pled guilty to money laundering conspiracy; both are awaiting sentencing.  The Commission thanks the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Postal Service for their assistance in this investigation.

The Commission alleges that from at least 1999 through early 2005, these defendants conspired in various schemes with seventeen purported stock loan ""finders"" to skim profits on stock loans. The defendants include:   Joseph ""Simone"" Simone, age 65, resides in Staten Island, New York. He was the co-head of VDM, a registered broker-dealer based in Brooklyn, N.Y. From June 1997 until May 2004, he was a ""finder"" employed by a brokerage firm, including Van der Moolen Specialists USA LLC (""VDM""), Janney Montgomery Scott LLC and Nomura Securities International Inc. (""Nomura""). From 1997 to June 2005 he allegedly worked as a Finder and was associated with a New Jersey-based broker dealer. Simone was also a stock dealer and a trader.

Joseph Simone, et al., Civil Action No. 07-3928 (EDNY)  SEC Charges Patrick Verdi and G.P. Institutional Services, Inc. In Multimillion Dollar Stock Loan Scam    The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an amended complaint in one of the ""stock loan"" civil actions filed on Thursday September 20, 2007. The Amended Complaint now also charges Patrick Verdi, the former supervisor of the stock loan desk of Schonfeld Securities LLC (""Schonfeld""), and G.P. Institutional Services, Inc. (""GP""), a purported stock loan finder firm controlled by Verdi, as defendants in the pending action, with engaging in a scheme to defraud Schonfeld and others through the payment of sham finder fees to GP.  The Amended Complaint specifically alleges as follows: From at least March 2000 through January 2004, Verdi schemed with defendant Joseph Simone, then the head of the stock loan desk of Van der Moolen Specialist USA, LLC (""VDM""), to pay sham finder fees to GP on stock loan transactions in which GP performed no services. VDM paid the sham finder fees to GP on stock loan transactions in which Verdi had Schonfeld borrow stock from, or lend stock to, VDM at rates that favored VDM at Schonfeld's expense. Simone had VDM lend or borrow the same stock in transactions with other firms at better rates, and GP's finder fees were paid out of VDM's artificial profits. Verdi and Simone arranged the stock loans themselves and GP did not provide any finding services on the transactions. Verdi controlled GP's bank accounts and transferred virtually all of the sham finder fees received by GP to members of his family. Verdi made approximately $2 million from the scheme.  The Commission's Amended Complaint charges Verdi and GP with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Amended Complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties against Verdi and GP.

123,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an Illinois-based investment adviser with defrauding senior citizens who entrusted him with their retirement savings.  The SEC alleges that Daniel H. Glick and two companies he controlled, Financial Management Strategies, Inc. and G.B. Slagter, misappropriated more than $1.5 million of the investors' money for personal use, including using investor funds to repay other investors and to pay expenses for his own businesses. According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the funds were pooled with investor assets and used to make investments in securities and other securities. The complaint further alleges the defendants lied to investors about the amount of their investments and the nature of those investments, and falsely told investors that their money would be used only for their benefit. In reality, according to one investor, more money was being used for other purposes, such as to purchase a Mercedes Benz for a family member, or to fund the mortgage on a home that was sold at a profit. As alleged in a separate SEC complaint, in 2013 and 2014, a third investor received over $900,000 from the same family, but none of these funds was ever used as intended. Instead of using the money as promised, as investors were told he would use it to invest their funds and pay their expenses, investors instead commingled investor money with his personal funds, with the understanding that he could use the rest of it for legitimate business purposes and not for any other purpose. Among the relief defendants are Edward H.' Forte of Palos Heights, Ill., and David Slagle of Chicago, Illinois. Both are friends and business associates of Glicks. They are members of his extended extended family and are invested in his companies, which provided tax and accounting services to individual and corporate tax clients and payroll management services for small businesses, respectively. Their investments were made with funds from their own accounts and were not segregated from other investor accounts. However, they did not have the right to pool their investment funds with other funds in their personal bank accounts, nor were they able to use them as they had previously been promised. To make up for these misstatements and misstatement of funds received from investors, defendants made numerous false statements in investor account statements and provided investors with false information about how they were using their assets. For example, one defendant falsely claimed to have obtained a CPA license from FINRA based","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an emergency asset freeze and temporary restraining order against a Chicago-based investment adviser and his financial management company accused of scamming elderly investors out of millions of dollars.  The SEC alleges that Daniel H. Glick and his unregistered investment advisory firm Financial Management Strategies (FMS) provided clients with false account statements to hide Glick's use of client funds to pay personal and business expenses, purchase a Mercedes-Benz, and pay off loans and debts among other misuses.  According to the SEC's complaint, Glick was barred by FINRA in 2014 and had his Certified Financial Planner designation and Certified Public Accountant license revoked for conduct unrelated to today's SEC charges.  The SEC's complaint also names Glick Accounting Services, Glick's business partner David B. Slagter, and Glick's business acquaintance Edward H. Forte as relief defendants for the purposes of recovering client funds that Glick transferred or paid them in the form of advances or loans.  The complaint alleges that Glick and FMS violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

124,"On September 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Clovis Oncology, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in Boulder, Colorado, and its former CEO and CFO, Patrick Mahaffy and Erle Mast, with misleading investors about the company's then flagship lung cancer drug, rociletinib.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on September 17, 2019, Clophis disclosed to investors that it had developed a drug to treat non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and that Roci's efficacy rate was 60% when the drug was developed. The complaint further alleges that the data provided to Mahaffle and Mast showed an ORR of 42%, which was materially lower than the previously disclosed 60%.  As alleged, in a parallel action, on October 8, 2015, after learning of the FDA's decision to approve the product for oral cancer treatment (Roci), the defendants continued to make untrue statements and/or omitted to state material facts in order to raise capital from investors, including misrepresenting the efficacy of their drug and the price at which the stock price was trading. In addition, they allegedly misled investors by failing to disclose the adverse side effect of a clinical trial that had resulted in an adverse effect on the clinical results. Finally, as the complaint alleges in its complaint filed against them, defendants Mast and Clavis failed to inform investors in advance of public earnings announcements that they would receive substantial ill-gotten gains from the sales of Clocritic cells (ORRs).  The SEC also alleges violations of antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement and civil penalties of $25,000 and $1,500, respectively, of which $5,800 will be deemed satisfied by the restitution ordered against each of them. Additionally, each defendant has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years and from participating in any offering of or selling any securities in connection with a public announcement of an NDA or a proposed licensing agreement.Â  The settlements are subject to court approval. For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 20","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company's developmental lung cancer drug.  The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug. According to the complaint, the company's investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally. Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent. The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, in evaluating Clovis' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its ""efficacy,"" or how well the drug worked. In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci's efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company's CFO at that time, showed that Roci's efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent. Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward. In November 2015, after Clovis disclosed the true efficacy, using the methodology required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its stock price dropped approximately 70 percent.  The SEC's complaint charges Clovis with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint charges Mahaffy with violating Section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting Clovis' violations of Section 13(a). The complaint charges Mast with aiding and abetting Clovis' federal securities laws violations. The defendants agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and the settlements are subject to court approval. Clovis agreed to a $20 million penalty. Mahaffy agreed to a $250,000 penalty. Mast agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and to provide disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $454,145, attributable to selling Clovis stock during the relevant period at inflated prices. The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalties to harmed investors.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 2007 through 2013, OM Group and its principal, CEO, and managing director of investments, Edwin Gaw and his firm, managed a $15.5 million fund that was defrauded of approximately $56.3 million in assets by raising money from investors through the unregistered sale of pre-IPO shares of Facebook, Inc. According to the complaint, in violation of a court order on May 29 of 2013 to freeze the assets of OM and OM Management, they raised over $14 million from more than 30 investors, including many advisory clients and family members, through a purported ""side pocket"" investment fund. The complaint also alleges, among other things, that the defendants distributed fabricated account statements, made false statements in SEC filings, failed to comply with Commission laws and rules concerning the operation of an advisory business, investment adviser, or the offering of securities, as well as made unauthorized loans and other unauthorized investments. In a parallel action, on September 26, 2018, a federal district court in Miami-Dade, Fla., entered an order freezing OM's assets and appointing a corporate monitor to oversee the continued management and ultimate dissolution of the fund, which is subject to court approval.

Jackson, Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-02987-CAP, United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia  SEC Charges Georgia Resident with Insider Trading  On August 28, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the Northern District of Georgia against Casey D. Jackson (âJacksonâ). The Commission alleges that Thomas D. Melvin (âMelvinâ), a Griffin, Georgia based CPA and friend of C. Roan Berry (âBerryâ), disclosed material non-public information about the pending tender offer for Chattem, Inc. (âChattemâ) securities to Berry. The Commission also alleges that Berry tipped his next door neighbor, Ashley J. Coots. The Commission further alleges that Coots tipped Casey D. Jackson (âJacksonâ), and that Jackson traded in the securities of Chattem based on that material non-public information.  According to the Commissionâs complaint, on December 21, 2009, Sanofi-Aventis (âSanofiâ), a French pharmaceutical company, announced its intent to make a tender offer for Chattem, a Tennessee-based distributor of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, at the price of $93.50 per share (âAnnouncementâ). Shares of Chattem closed 32.60% higher on the day of the Announcement than the prior trading dayâs close of $69.98 and volume increased more than 3,000% to 10.3 million shares.  The Commission alleges that in early December 2009, several weeks before the Announcement, an independent board member of Chattem who owned Chattem options that would automatically exercise in the event of an ownership change at Chattem, initiated a series of confidential conversations and meetings with his longtime accountant, Melvin, to discuss potential methods of ameliorating the effect of an acquisition of Chattem on his tax liability. The Chattem board member told Melvin sufficient facts such that, given Melvinâs knowledge of the board memberâs affairs, Melvin would have clearly known that the board member was discussing Chattem. Melvin and the Chattem board member also discussed the price impact of the tender offer on the board memberâs options.  The Commission further alleges that Melvin misappropriated material non-public information regarding the impending tender offer for Chattem securities. Within days of his first meeting with the board member, Melvin disclosed material non-public information about the impending tender offer to Berry. Berry tipped Coots, who tipped Jackson. Jackson traded in Chattem securities based on the material non-public information Coots disclosed to him.

Jeremy R. Lent, John V. Hashman, Yinzi Cai, Douglas Wachtel and Bruce Rigione, Civil Action No.: 3:04-CV-2449 (N.D. Cal.)  SEC Charges Three Former Senior Executives of NextCard With Improperly Improving the Company's Credit Card Losses   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against three former senior executives of the San Francisco-based credit card issuer Nextcard, N.A. (""NextCard""), for their roles in a series of undisclosed, after-the-quarter accounting adjustments that resulted in materially false and misleading financial statements and other material misstatements in its earnings releases and periodic reports for 2000 and 2001 fiscal years. According to the Commission's complaint, from at least November 2000 through the end of October 2001, the defendants knew that the company had incurred a significant amount of delinquent loans and charged-off loans that should have been written down as &#8220;credit losses.&#8221;  Instead of disclosing the credit cards' losses and delinquencies to investors, defendants made a number of ""reclassification"" adjustments to lower artificially the reported level of delinquency and bad loan write-offs and to deprive investors of their ability to inalyze the financial results in any meaningful fashion. The complaint alleges that these adjustments were designed to make it appear that nextCard had fewer losses than previously expected. As a result of these actions, NextCaid's stock price fell 84% that day, and its stock value fell more than 100%.  In a parallel action, on December 30, 2001 the U. S. Attorney's Office filed criminal charges against the four former executives, including the former chief financial officer and controller, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b), 13(d)(2)(A), 14(c), and 15(e)(b)(5) in connection with the same conduct. In addition to these charges, today's action charges the following","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No.  18905 / September 28, 2004  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2112 / September 28, 2004  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

HASHMAN, YINZI CAI, DOUGLAS WACHTEL and BRUCE RIGIONE, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C-04-4088 FMS  SEC BRINGS FRAUD AND INSIDER TRADING CHARGES AGAINST FORMER TOP EXECUTIVES OF NEXTCARD, INC.  On September 28, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against the former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") and three other senior officers of NextCard, Inc., a San Francisco, California-based credit card issuer.  NextCard, which is now in bankruptcy, was the first major credit card issuer to offer cards exclusively over the Internet.  According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in at least November 2000, NextCard began to suffer higher than expected delinquencies and losses on its credit card loans-a reflection of customers paying their credit card bills late or not paying them at all.  Instead of revealing these problems to investors, NextCard's senior officers made a series of undisclosed, after-the-quarter accounting adjustments on NextCard's books.  The adjustments - which NextCard's then-CEO described in his own handwritten notes as ""accounting gimmickry"" - made it appear that NextCard's customers were paying their bills in a timely fashion, a key indicator of the financial health of a credit card issuer.  In fact, NextCard's business model of issuing credit cards over the Internet resulted in NextCard issuing cards to many customers with relatively poor credit who could not pay back their credit card loans in a timely fashion and, in many instances, not at all.  Instead of accounting for these as bad loans and writing them off as uncollectible, as NextCard had done in previous quarters, NextCard simply reclassified many of these accounts as ""fraudulent accounts,"" which were not separately reported to the public, and then failed to tell anyone.  Thus, defendants led stock analysts and investors to believe falsely that NextCard was meeting its projections and that its late-paying and uncollectible loans were rising only moderately, when in fact they were escalating rapidly.  The Commission's complaint charges the following former NextCard officers with financial fraud: former Chairman Jeremy Lent of Holualoa, Hawaii; former CEO, John Hashman of Danville, Calif.; former President and Chief Operating Officer Yinzi Cai of Palo Alto, Calif.; former Controller, Douglas Wachtel of San Francisco, Calif.; and former Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Rigione of New Canaan, Conn.  The complaint, which was filed in federal district court in San Francisco, also charges Lent, Hashman, Cai and Wachtel with insider trading, based on their sale of NextCard stock at inflated prices during the course of the fraud.  Lent sold approximately $7 million worth of NextCard stock, Hashman sold $321,000, Cai sold $423,000 and Wachtel sold $105,000.  Lent's stock sales were carried out through the Lent Family Trust, which is also named in the complaint as a relief defendant.  The complaint alleges that NextCard failed to disclose to investors reclassifications or changes in its accounting methodology for late paying and uncollectible loans in its earnings releases and periodic reports for the fourth quarter of the 2000 fiscal year and the first and second quarters of 2001.  In addition, the complaint alleges that for the second quarter of 2001 NextCard changed its methodology for calculating reserves for its uncollectible loans.  This change reduced the amount of reserves the company had to set aside to cover expected losses on its loans by 15% to 25%, and artificially inflated the company's reported net income for the second quarter of 2001.  According to the complaint, in October 2001 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (""OCC""), which regulated NextCard's subsidiary, NextBank, required NextCard to reverse the reclassifications and changes in accounting methodology.  On October 31, 2001, NextCard issued a press release stating that it was changing its accounting for uncollectible loans and that the OCC considered NextBank to be significantly undercapitalized.  NextCard's stock price fell 84% that day, and the company went into bankruptcy the following year.  The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with committing and aiding and abetting fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting NextCard's violations of the same statue.  The complaint also charges Lent, Hashman, Rigione and Wachtel with aiding and abetting NextCard's violations of the reporting provisions of the Exchanges Act, Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Further, Lent, Hashman, Cai and Wachtel are charged in the complaint for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and for insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges Lent, Hashman and Cai as control persons for NextCard's violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and  Hashman and Lent as control persons for NextCard's violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  This is the second action brought by the Commission as a result of the financial fraud at NextCard.  In September 2003, the Commission charged three former employees of NextCard's independent auditors, Ernst and Young (""E&Y""), for altering and destroying E&Y's working papers for the fiscal year 2000 audit of E&Y client NextCard, Inc.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

128,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Algird M. Norkus and Financial Update, Inc. with conducting a multi-million dollar offering fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from as early as 1993 through at least July 2010, the former president of financial advice company Financial update, engaged in a fraudulent offering scheme involving the sale of promissory notes issued by a company that purported to be in the business of insurance and annuity sales. According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint:  From as far back as 1991, NORKUS, acting as President, solicited investors by promising interest rates between 11% and 24% per year. In reality, he used investor money to pay for personal expenses such as his mortgage and a car. He also used the money provided by newer investors to make interest and principal payments to earlier investors. As a result of his conduct, investors received approximately $6.4 million in interest from the offering, and the investors generally received their required monthly interest payments. Instead of using investors&rsquo; money as promised, as he told investors, it would be used to fund financial operations, including his home mortgage, car, home and business expenses. The complaint further alleges, that in order to keep his scheme from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, defendants consented to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions and requires them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon and pay civil penalties of up to $100,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of $1,095, plus interest $10,924, for a period of five years, with a civil penalty of three years and an officer and director bar, respectively. Both defendants also agreed not to violate the anti-fraud, registration, books and records, internal controls, broker-dealer registration and officer-and-director bars, which will be determined by the court at a later date.

Forrester, with fraudulently selling to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  According to the SEC's complaint, between January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlees, Stewart and Underwood, acting individually and through a network of salesmen who they recruited and controlled, sold interests to over 150 retail investors in the unregistered oil joint venture offerings of Tennstar Energy, Inc. (""Tennstar""), a Tennessee corporation formerly administratively dissolved, and Black Gold Resources Inc.'s (BGR), which later changed its name to Tennessee-based TennStar Energy. The SEC alleges that the defendants used nearly half of the investor funds for their own benefit and to pay salespeople, including a former stockbroker trainee, to dupe investors into believing they were interested in seeing oil wells. In reality, neither Tennessee company was registered to sell the oil to investors. Instead, they installed figureheads that had little or no experience in oil industry industry experience and created and distributed false biographies for these figurehead individuals that misrepresented that they had significant relevant experience. They also used fake names to hide their identities and criminal records to create the appearance of activity, which, in turn, were distributed to various investors to lull or induce further investments. Finally, as a result of their fraud, defendants pled guilty to one count of securities fraud and were ordered to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties of up to $1.5 million, respectively. Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1)(2)(A), (2),(3), and(4)-8(B) in connection with their fraudulent scheme.

According to the Commission's complaint, David R. Greenlee and David A. Stewart Jr. orchestrated the $15 million scheme by recruiting and controlling a network of salesmen who offered and sold investors a stake in various companies purportedly using enhanced oil recovery techniques like fracking to extract and sell oil from wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  Investors were allegedly promised profits of 15 to 50 percent per year for decades.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Greenlee and Stewart used fake names like ""Dave Johnson"" when speaking to investors in order to hide their past criminal records, and they diverted nearly two-thirds of the money raised from investors to pay themselves and their salesmen as well as advertise for new investors.  According to the Commission's complaint, minimal funds were used for oil production at just a few of the wells in order to create the appearance of oil production and dupe investors who wanted to see activity in-person.  The Commission's complaint further alleges that Richard ""Ric"" P. Underwood helped Greenlee and Stewart draft false offering brochures, and he oversaw a boiler room sales team of telemarketers in Florida as they solicited investors nationwide.  According to the Commission's complaint, Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, Southern Energy Group, Inc., which is now administratively dissolved, and Black Gold Resources, Inc., which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc.

Company, Its Former CEO, and Former CFO; Company Settles Charges    On September 26, 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint in the Fort Worth federal court against US Global Nanospace, Inc. (""USGN""), a developmental stage ""penny stock"" company, its former chief executive officer, John D. Robinson, and the company's former chief financial officer, Julie E. Seaman. Robinson, age 51, of Alvarado, Texas, is alleged to have violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws by causing the Arlington, Texas public company to issue materially misleading press releases regarding the company's purported defense and homeland security products. The complaint also alleges that Robinson, USGN, and Seaman, age 46, of Granbury, Texas, violated the registration provisions in connection with the offer and sale of approximately 3.1 million shares of USGN common stock for approximately $1.4 million.   According to the complaint, between March 2003 and January 2004 (the ""relevant period""), Robinson authorized USGN to issue five press releases which contained materially misleading statements about the company's supposed development and seemingly imminent sale of several products intended for defense and homeland security applications. For example, in April 2003, a press release announced that the company had received ""orders"" from two commercial airlines to purchase USGN's reinforced cockpit door. In fact, according to the complaint, the company had merely received non-binding letters of intent from the two airlines, neither of which ever resulted in actual sales by USGN. The complaint also alleges that during relevant period, USGN's common stock, which was quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets, rose in price from $0.10 or less to more than $1.22 per share on an average daily volume of approximately 1 million shares.   The complaint also alleges that during that during the relevant period, Robinson and Seaman publicly sold approximately 3.1 million shares of USGN common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.4 million. The shares were issued to Robinson and Seaman in lieu of cash salary and were offered and sold pursuant to several Form S-8 registration statements filed with the Commission. Contrary to the provisions of Form S-8, it is alleged that the defendants utilized approximately $500,000 of the stock sale proceeds to fund the operations of USGN. Accordingly, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the registration provisions.   USGN has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it against future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that, between March 12, 2001 and September 29, 2007 (the ""Relevant Period""), the German manufacturer of industrial and consumer products made thousands of separate payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe government authorities in several countries, including Venezuela, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, and Iraq. The Commission's complaint also alleges that at least $27.5 million of these payments were made prior to November 15, 2006, when the company's current management began to implement reforms to improve its internal controls. According to the complaint, the improper payments involved employees at all levels of the Company's business group and involved a corporate culture that had long been at odds with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The complaint further alleges, during the relevant period, that the bribery scheme was a widespread and systematic practice that involved paying bribes to third parties in exchange for business from the end of 2001 through the first quarter of 2007. In addition, SiemENS paid over $2 billion in kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (UNODG).

SEC Files Settled Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges Against Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide Bribery With Total Disgorgement and Criminal Fines of Over $1.6 Billion  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on December 12, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (""Siemens""), a Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of industrial and consumer products, with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""). Siemens has offered to pay a total of $1.6 billion in disgorgement and fines, which is the largest amount a company has ever paid to resolve corruption-related charges. Siemens has agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to the SEC. In related actions, Siemens will pay a $450 million criminal fine to the U.S. Department of Justice and a fine of &#128;395 million (approximately $569 million) to the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany. Siemens previously paid a fine of &#128;201 million (approximately $285 million) to the Munich Prosecutor in October 2007.  The SEC's complaint alleges that:  Between March 12, 2001 and September 30, 2007, Siemens violated the FCPA by engaging in a widespread and systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain business. Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of its corrupt payments, and the company's inadequate internal controls allowed the conduct to flourish. The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA.  During this period, Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the money. At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens around the world. Among others, Siemens paid bribes on transactions to design and build metro transit lines in Venezuela; metro trains and signaling devices in China; power plants in Israel; high voltage transmission lines in China; mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh; telecommunications projects in Nigeria; national identity cards in Argentina; medical devices in Vietnam, China, and Russia; traffic control systems in Russia; refineries in Mexico; and mobile communications networks in Vietnam. Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned over $1.1 billion in profits on these transactions.  An additional approximately 1,185 separate payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million were not properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for illicit purposes, including commercial bribery and embezzlement.  From 1999 to 2003, Siemens' Managing Board or ""Vorstand"" was ineffective in implementing controls to address constraints imposed by Germany's 1999 adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (""OECD"") anti-bribery convention that outlawed foreign bribery. The Vorstand was also ineffective in meeting the U.S. regulatory and anti-bribery requirements that Siemens was subject to following its March 12, 2001, listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite knowledge of bribery at two of its largest groups &#8212; Communications and Power Generation &#8212; the company's tone at the top was inconsistent with an effective FCPA compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was tolerated and even rewarded at the highest levels of the company. Employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash desks, which were sometimes transported in suitcases across international borders for bribery. Authorizations for payments were placed on post-it notes and later removed to eradicate any permanent record. Siemens used numerous slush funds, off-books accounts maintained at unconsolidated entities, and a system of business consultants and intermediaries to facilitate the corrupt payments.  Siemens failed to implement adequate internal controls to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA. Elaborate payment mechanisms were used to conceal the fact that bribe payments were made around the globe to obtain business. False invoices and payment documentation was created to make payments to business consultants under false business consultant agreements that identified services that were never intended to be rendered. Illicit payments were falsely recorded as expenses for management fees, consulting fees, supply contracts, room preparation fees, and commissions. Siemens inflated U.N. contracts, signed side agreements with Iraqi ministries that were not disclosed to the U.N., and recorded the ASSF payments as legitimate commissions despite U.N., U.S., and international sanctions against such payments.  In November 2006, Siemens' current management began to implement reforms to the company's internal controls. These reforms substantially reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt payments occurred before November 15, 2006. The company conducted a massive internal investigation and implemented an amnesty program to its employees to gather information.  Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the payments in its books.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Siemens has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include profits factored into Munich's fine; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an independent monitor for a period of four years. On December 15, 2008, the court entered the final judgment. Since being approached by SEC staff, Siemens has cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation, and the SEC considered the remedial acts promptly undertaken by Siemens. Siemens' massive internal investigation and lower level employee amnesty program was essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of Siemens' FCPA violations.

134,"On February 4, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Total Wealth Management, Inc., a Los Angeles-based investment advisory firm, and its principal, David Van Haver, with fraud in connection with the sale of unregistered securities.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least February 2014 through the present, Total and VanHaver misused investor funds to pay for personal expenses for themselves and their family members, including the purchase of a home and a car stereo system. The SEC alleges that Total misappropriated investor monies for its own personal use and used the money to make payments to investors and to repay a loan to an investment adviser. In a parallel action, on February 7, 2016, a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment against Total, permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(c) thereunder, ordering Total to disgorge its ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.

The Commission's investigation is continuing.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges and an emergency temporary restraining order and asset freeze against a Utah resident and his San Diego, Calif. investment advisory firm.  The SEC alleges that Jacob Keith Cooper and Total Wealth Management Inc. wrongfully took at least $150,000 from clients in order to partially fund the potential settlement of an administrative proceeding previously instituted against them in 2014 by the SEC's Division of Enforcement (for additional information on the prior proceeding, see Release No. 33-9575 at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/33-9575.pdf).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, the Division of Enforcement had reached a tentative settlement with Cooper and Total Wealth in the previously-instituted administrative proceeding that required Cooper to escrow $150,000.  However, after learning that Cooper intended to pay this amount using funds misappropriated from clients, the Division terminated this settlement and the agency brought this emergency action in federal district court.  Cooper's use of investor funds for his settlement with the SEC was never disclosed to or authorized by clients, and was a breach of Total Wealth's and Cooper's fiduciary duty to their clients.  According to the complaint, Cooper admitted to taking $150,000 in investor monies to fund his escrow settlement, although he claims that it was a ""loan.""  According to the complaint, Cooper has also admitted that he and Total Wealth have used investor monies to pay unspecified legal expenses related to the Division of Enforcement's previously-instituted administrative proceeding as well as a private class action lawsuit filed in California state court.  The complaint alleges that Total Wealth has been charging investors unexplained, inflated ""administrative fees"" to pay those expenses and that Total Wealth and Cooper have failed to provide any accounting or meaningful explanation for the fees to investors, despite investors' repeated requests.    The Honorable Cynthia Bashant for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California issued an order temporarily enjoining Cooper and Total Wealth from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, as well as orders (1) freezing Cooper's and Total Wealth's assets; (2) appointing a temporary receiver; (3) prohibiting the destruction of documents, (4) expediting discovery; and (5) requiring accountings.  Cooper and Total Wealth stipulated to the entry of the court orders without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.  The SEC also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, return of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Cooper and Total Wealth.    A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants and whether a permanent receiver should be appointed is scheduled for February 13, 2015.

Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and John F. Gifford, United States District Court for the Northern District of California (N.D. Cal.).  SEC CHARGES MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC. AND ITS FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH BACKDATING OPTIONS  The Securities &amp;Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil action in federal district court in San Jose, California, against Maxim Integrated Products Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based semiconductor company, and its former chief executive officer, John ""John"" Gafford. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 2000 through 2005, Maxim engaged in a scheme to illegally backdate stock options granted to employees and directors, concealing millions of dollars in compensation expenses from investors and significantly overstating the company's income. According to the complaint, the backdating allowed Maxim to grant ""in-the-money"" options to current employees at a lower price than the stock's market price on the day of the grant. In order to provide Maxim's employees with valuable &#8220;in the money&#8221; options without recording an expense, it routinely backdated stock option grants to dates corresponding to historical low stock prices. For example, for ten consecutive quarters from the second quarter of fiscal year 2002 through the fourth quarter in 2004, a number of options were granted at an exercise price equal to that day's closing stock price of $34.10. Each option was granted with hindsight, which resulted in the issuance of undisclosed options at the time of grant by Maxim. As a result of its misconduct and improper use of back-dated options grants, stock was overstated in its financial statements for fiscal years 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005 by as much as 10%.  Maxim, without admitting or denying the Commission&rsquo;s allegations, consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), (3), and (4) and 10(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1 and 13a-2 thereunder, ordering","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20381 / December 4, 2007  AAERxxxxxxx -->  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and John F. Gifford, Case No. C-07-6121 RMW  (N.D. Cal. Dec. 4, 2007)  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Carl W. Jasper, Case No. C-07-6122 HRL (N.D. Cal. Dec. 4, 2007)  SEC Sues Maxim Integrated Products and Former Senior Officers in Stock Option Backdating Scheme  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil charges against Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., a Silicon Valley semiconductor company, and the company's former CEO and CFO, alleging that they reported false financial information to investors by improperly backdating stock option grants to Maxim employees and directors.  The Commission alleges that former CFO Carl W. Jasper, of San Jose, Calif., helped the company fraudulently conceal tens of millions of dollars in compensation expenses through the use of backdated, ""in-the-money"" option grants.  In a separate action, former President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board John F. Gifford, of Menlo Park, Calif., agreed to pay more than $800,000 in disgorgement, interest, and penalties to settle charges relating to his role in the options backdating.  Maxim similarly has agreed to settle the Commission's charges against it.  The Commission's complaints, filed in federal district court in San Jose, allege that Maxim routinely provided potentially lucrative in-the-money options (i.e., options granted at below market prices) to employees.  Under well-settled accounting principles, granting in-the-money options obligated the company to report compensation expenses to shareholders.  The Commission alleges that Maxim avoided reporting these expenses by backdating paperwork to make it appear that the options had been granted on an earlier date.  As a result, the company overstated its net income by more than 10% for its fiscal years 2003 through 2005.  The Commission's complaints also allege that former CFO Jasper was aware of the improper backdating practices, drafted backdated grant approval documents for Maxim's CEO to sign, and disregarded instructions from CEO Gifford to record an expense in connection with certain backdated options.  According to the Commission, Gifford should have known that the company was not reporting expenses for those in-the-money stock options and instead was falsely reporting that they were granted at fair market value.  Maxim, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.  Gifford, also without admitting or denying the allegations, agreed to a permanent injunction against violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.  Gifford also agreed to disgorge a portion of his bonuses (totaling $652,681 with prejudgment interest) and pay a $150,000 civil penalty.  The Commission's litigated action against Jasper charges him with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder.  The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of wrongful profits, a civil penalty, and an order barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company.

According to the SEC's complaint, Shane Fleming, then a Vice President of Sales, learned of negotiations to sell itself on or before February 23, 2015, and tipped his long time friend and business partner Austin Mansur, who agreed to pay approximately $10,000 in kickback in exchange for the trading profits. The complaint alleges that Beshey also tipped four of his friends, Christopher Bonvissuto, Dimitri Kandalepas, Austin Mansur and Eric Weller, in the course of trading, tipping the inside information he received from his friend. As alleged, the traders collectively bought 250 life-time call options and 250 Life-Time shares of each company, realizing total illegal profits of $866,629.

In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, the SEC alleges that Shane P. Fleming, a former vice president of sales at Life Time Fitness, learned of the merger discussions on or before Feb. 23, 2015 and tipped his friend and business partner Bret J. Beshey with the understanding that Beshey would use the information to make a profit and split those profits with Fleming.  The SEC alleges that rather than trade in his own name, Beshey tipped his friends Christopher M. Bonvissuto and Peter A. Kourtis with the understanding that both men would kick back a portion of their trading proceeds to Beshey.  According to the SEC's complaint, Kourtis tipped his friends Alexander T. Carlucci, Dimitri A. Kandalepas, Austin C. Mansur, and Eric L. Weller, and asked Carlucci, Mansur, and Weller to give him a portion of any profits they made from trading on the information, which they agreed to do.  The SEC alleges that the six traders purchased a total of approximately 2,000 highly speculative out-of-the-money call options for Life Time Fitness shares and sold those options for profits of approximately $866,209 shortly after a newspaper reported that Life Time Fitness was in advanced merger discussions with two private equity firms.  According to the SEC's complaint, Bonvissuto and Kourtis shared a portion of their profits with Beshey, who gave approximately $10,000 in cash to Fleming.  The SEC also alleges that Carlucci and Mansur paid cash kickbacks to Kourtis, and that Weller gave Kourtis at least 10 pounds of marijuana as a kickback.

The action was filed against defendants Virtual Cash, its CEO and president, Eric L. Turner (&quot;Turner&quot;), its vice-president, Kenneth M. May (&quot;May&quot;), Omni Advertising, Inc. (&quot;Omni&quot;) and Omni's president, Anthony Joseph Pinone (&quot;Pinone&quot;).  On the same day, the Honorable Kenneth A. Marra, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered, among other things, a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the defendants' assets.  According to the Commission's complaint, Virtual Cash, Turner and May, through  Omni, a boiler room operated by Pinone, have been offering unregistered securities to investors nationwide.  The SEC alleged that Virtual Cash and its principals have raised more than $1 million from more than 70 investors to purportedly fund short-term cash advances for its purported payday advance business.  The complaint alleges that in raising money from investors for this enterprise, Virtual Cash, Turner and May represented to investors that, among other things, their funds would be used to purchase accounts receivable loan contracts and that their funds would be fully collateralized by accounts receivable.  Instead, the SEC alleged that of the money taken in from investors, only $156,000 was used to purchase accounts receivable.  Further, according to the SEC's complaint, Virtual Cash, Turner and May failed to tell investors that 15% of their funds would be used to pay excessive sales commissions to Omni and that an additional 3% of their funds would be used to pay commissions to May.  As a result, the Commission charges Virtual Cash, Turner, May, Omni and Pinone with violations of registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&quot;Securities Act&quot;).  The Commission further charges Virtual Cash, Turner and May with violations of anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the SEC charges May, Omni, and Pinone with violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act for acting as unregistered brokers, and charges Turner with aiding and abetting May's, Omni's and Pinone's violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  In addition to the emergency relief described above, the Commission is also seeking permanent injunctions prohibiting future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten profits and money penalties.

The fraud allowed TheStreet to report artificially inflated revenue and misstated operating income or loss in each period of 2008.  The SEC alleges that throughout 2008, Eric Ashman, TheStreet's former Chief Financial Officer, aided and abetted the fraud by improperly and prematurely recognizing revenue based on several of the former subsidiary's transactions.  According to the complaint, Ashman caused TheStreet to recognize revenue when he knew or recklessly disregarded that there was no basis for revenue recognition.  Gregg Alwine and David Barnett, co-presidents of the subsidiary, are alleged to have aided and abetted the fraud by entering into sham transactions, and fabricating and backdating contracts and other documents.  In addition, Barnett is charged with leading TheStreet's auditor to believe that the subsidiary had performed services and thereby earned revenue on a specific transaction when in fact it had not performed those services.  For its part, TheStreet is charged with lacking appropriate internal controls over its subsidiary's revenue and with violating books and records and reporting provisions of the securities laws.

139,"On April 10, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Yu-Yue Chen with insider trading in the securities of Skyworks Solutions, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, between April 21, 2014 and July 17, 2015, Chen accessed the company's accounting and finance area, reviewed non-public financial reports, and used that information to make large trades in advance of quarterly earnings announcements, including, but not limited to, during the period April to July 2014. The complaint further alleges Chen liquidated his securities positions for a profit of at least $739,959. In September 2014, when the SEC announced positive earnings results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 (ended June 27), Chen sold his shares, realizing more than $475,000 in profits and a few thousand dollars in stock trades. According to the Commission, after the release of its earnings report on July 18, 2016, SkyWorks reported a positive outlook for its fourth fiscal quarter, up 35% year-over-year and 22% sequentially, from the prior year's fourth quarter results. After the announcement of the earnings and the positive financial results in April and third quarters of 2014 - the complaint alleges - Chen again engaged in unlawful trading, this time using his employee security badge to gain unauthorized access to a restricted office area. This time, however, he used the security guard to conceal his illegal trading from his colleagues and to evade detection by the accounting staff. When one of these employees entered the office and asked Chen to stop, a second employee followed and Chen instead ran out of sight behind the building. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both Chen and his employer have agreed to settle the matter by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties. Chen has also consented to an officer-and-director bar and an order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from participating in any offering of a penny stock, with the right to reapply after a period of five years. As a result of his conduct, as alleged, defendants are charged with violating Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3), and Rules 17a-1, 17","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of insider trading charges against a former engineer at Skyworks Solutions, Inc., a Massachusetts-based company with executive offices and a design center in Irvine, California that designs, manufactures and sells wireless analog semiconductors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Yuh-Yue Chen, while working as an engineer at Skyworks in Irvine, traded multiple times in advance of the company's earnings announcements.  The complaint further alleges that Chen improperly accessed the company's accounting and finance area, reviewed non-public financial reports, and used that information to purchase Skyworks securities in advance of the company's announcements of financial results for the second and third quarters in 2014.  The SEC charges that after Skyworks announced positive quarterly financial results on April 22, 2014 and again on July 17, 2014, Chen sold Skyworks securities for a total profit of at least $739,959.  The complaint further alleges that in September 2014, Chen fled the country after Skyworks' security found him loitering in the office restricted area designated for the accounting and finance staff.  He recently returned to the United States for a visit at the end of March, when he was interviewed and subsequently served with the SEC's complaint prior to his planned departure.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a former stock options administrator at Wireless Facilities, Inc. (WFI), a provider of outsourced engineering and network deployment services for the wireless communications industry. The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court in Southern District of California, alleges that, between November 2002 and 2003, Vincenette Donlan fraudulently caused WFI to issue more than 700,000 shares of its stock and stock option stock to his wife, Robin D., who was the primary account holder of an account that received 728,229 of the stock. According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint:   In June 2002, while he was a stock-options administrator for W FI, he engaged in a fraudulent scheme by which he took at least 700 of these shares and sold them on the open market. In connection with these transactions, DonLAN used two methods for fraudulating the issuance of stock: (1) creating false entries in WIFI stock plan management and reporting software to hide the grants to Colls; and (2) directing E*Trade to initiate the transfer of those shares into the joint account in order for Coll's account to be transferred to a brokerage firm and transfer agent. As a result of this conduct, the Commission alleges, Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, a civil money penalty, an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar against each defendant and an order prohibiting them from destroying documents, transferring funds, or participating in any offering of any security, including securities, in violation of Sections 5(a), (c), and 17(d)(3) or 5 ofÂ Securities Act and Section 15(e) Rules of Practice and Rules 12a-1, 13a2-11, 15e-3, 16a1-2, 17","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20329 / October 12, 2007  SEC v.

Donlan pled guilty to the violations on July 3, 2007, under a plea agreement with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California. The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") previously sued Donlan for perpetrating the fraudulent stock options scheme.  In his plea, Donlan admitted that between November 2002 and November 2003, he used his position as WFI's stock option administrator to issue without authorization 728,229 shares of WFI stock to a brokerage account that he controlled and sold the stock for a net gain of $6,252,794. Donlan also admitted that he evaded paying $2,202,917 in federal income taxes in 2002 and 2003 by not declaring the income from his WFI stock sales. The Honorable John A.

The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants created and distributed promotional materials for a supposed oil-exploration company known as PrimeGen Energy Corp. (PrimeGen), which purported to be headquarter in Bridgewater, New Jersey and to have operations in Russia. According to the complaint, defendants' materials took the form of ""investment opinions"" sent to newswires, &#8220;spam&#8221; emails sent at or about April 28, 2009 and May 12, 2010. The complaints also allege that Defendants' marketing materials typically express a positive opinion about the company being promoted, its revenues and the future direction of the stock's price. For example, from January 2009 to November 2009, Defendants created promotional material for Caliber Energy, Inc., a purported developer of wind-energy projects in China, which was also promoted in a series of press releases. In the case of Prime Gen, these claims mostly concerned supposed success in drilling for oil in the Russian Far East, but the claims were often repeated in mass emails and mass e-mail. Finally, they allegedly included a disclaimer stating that ""all statements and expressions are the sole opinion of WSC and are subject to change without notice."" The complaint further alleges, however, that defendants had no reasonable basis for those opinions and that, even when they have received ample warning signs that a scam is afoot, their statements did not have the independent basis to substantiate the statements made in this release nor approved the timing of these announcements.

February 7, 2011)  On February 7, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida charging the stock-promotion company Wall Street Capital Funding LLC (WSCF), its owners Philip Cardwell and Roy Campbell, and their associate Aaron Hume with disseminating fraudulent information concerning a series of sham energy companies.  The complaint alleges that the defendants created and distributed various forms of promotional material for, among other issuers, a purported oil-exploration-and-development company known as PrimeGen Energy Corp. PrimeGen claimed to be headquartered in New Jersey and to have active operations in Russia. According to its press releases, PrimeGen supposedly brought at least twelve oil wells into production in 2009 and generated many millions of dollars in revenues. The complaint alleges, however, that PrimeGen was phony: its corporate headquarters were a rented mailbox in a UPS Store opened with a do-not-forward instruction; its phone line was unattended; and its web page was generated by copying the source code from another company&#8217;s web site.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, the defendants&#8217; promotional materials took the form of &#8220;investment opinions&#8221; sent to newswires, mass emails sent to as many as fifty million addresses at once, and other forms of electronic communication.  The defendants&#8217; materials typically expressed positive opinions about penny-stock companies, their revenues, and the future direction of their stock price. The complaint alleges, however, that defendants had no reasonable basis for their opinions, yet at the same time falsely created the appearance of an independent basis for their statements about the penny-stock companies. Moreover, the complaint alleges that even when the defendants received ample warning signs that a scam was afoot, they always did the same thing: they closed their eyes and published.  The complaint alleges that WSCF, Cardwell, Campbell, and Hume violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), that WSCF, Cardwell, and Campbell directly violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Cardwell, Campbell, and Hume violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder as aiders and abettors.  The complaint further asserts that Cardwell and Campbell are liable as control persons for WSCF&#8217;s violations of the Exchange Act.

Alpeca of Buffalo, New York and Atlanta, Georgia with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with a scheme to defraud clients and/or prospective investors. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 2004 through the present, Angelo â a registered investment adviser based in Atlanta and his Atlanta-based advisory firm,Â Summit Wealth Capital Management Inc. of Atlanta (a.k.a., ""theÂs investment advisers""), solicited investments from the investors of Summit and its advisory clients. Investors in Summit Fund were told that the fund would operate as a fund-of-funds, but, in fact, starting in or around 2006, Aloleca engaged in active securities trading and incurred substantial losses.  In order to try to cover up the losses, the defendants started two additional funds-Asset Wealth Investment Trust LP (""Asset Fund"") and private credit opportunities fund LLC (""Credit Fund""). In exchange for providing capital for those funds, investors in both funds received interests in those respective funds.

Angelo A. Alleca, et al., Civil Case No. 1:12-cv-03261-WSD (N.D. Ga.)  SEC CHARGES ATLANTA-BASED ADVISER WITH OPERATING PONZI-LIKE SCHEME INVOLVING PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint on September 18, 2012 against Angelo A. Alleca, a private fund manager and his Atlanta-based investment advisory firm, Summit Wealth Management, Inc. and three funds operated and controlled by Alleca for defrauding investors in a purported âfund-of-fundsâ and then trying to hide trading losses by creating new private funds to make money to pay back the original fund investors in Ponzi-like fashion. According to the SECâs complaint Alleca and Summit Wealth Management offered and sold interests in Summit Investment Fund, LP, which they told their clients was operating as a fund-of-funds â meaning they were investing their money in other funds and investment products rather than directly in stocks and other securities. However, Alleca instead engaged in active securities trading with his clientsâ money, and he incurred substantial losses. He concealed the Summit Fund trading losses from investors and provided them false account statements.  The complaint alleges that Alleca created at least two hedge funds to raise money from Summit Wealth clients â Private Credit Opportunities Fund, LLC and Asset Class Diversification Fund, LP. Allecaâs plan, according to the complaint, was to cover up the losses that he had incurred in Summit Fund by illegally transferring profits from the new funds in a Ponzi-like fashion in order to meet earlier redemption requests. However, Allecaâs plan backfired when those successive funds incurred further trading losses. Alleca continued to issue false account statements to investors in Summit Fund as well as the additional funds in order to hide the actual losses on their investments. The complaint alleges that, in total, Alleca raised approximately $17 million from approximately 200 clients of Summit Wealth Management.  The SECâs complaint charges Alleca, Summit Wealth Management, and the three funds with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

SEC Charges Latvian in $850,000 Fraudulent Market Manipulation Scheme   On June 7, the Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that, from June 2009 through August 2010, N.A. engaged in a market manipulation scheme by manipulating the stock prices of 104 different NYSE and Nasdaq securities. The complaint alleges that from at least April 2009 until August 2011, he conducted unauthorized trading in hijacked online customer accounts at large broker-dealer firms and made unauthorized purchases and sales of securities that were listed on major stock exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange. According to the complaint, these unauthorized trades created the false appearance of legitimate trading activity and artificially affected the price of the securities by only a small amount. On each of these 159 occasions, on each date, and on 159 separate occasions since inception of this scheme in late 2009 or early 2010 through the use of an omnibus account held in his name at an unregistered trading firm. As set forth in Section 17(a) of Securities Act, this conduct violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, because it involved deceptive conduct and a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market price in which he already held a position through one of least eight registered trading firms where he was an authorized trader. In addition to trading profits from his illegal trading activities, however, there was no legitimate basis for his fraudulent conduct. For example, as alleged, in its complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, defendants Nagarevs of Latvia and Mercury Capital Management, LLC of La Jolla, Calif. and Zanshin Enterprises of Idaho, Inc. of Boise, Idaho operated as an online brokerage firm, which provided trading access to customers through omnibuses and accounts in their names.

The SEC also instituted related administrative proceedings today against four electronic trading firms and eight executives charged with enabling the trader&rsquo;s scheme by allowing him anonymous and unfiltered access to the U.S. markets.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Igors Nagaicevs broke into online brokerage accounts of customers at large U.S. broker-dealers and drove stock prices up or down by making unauthorized purchases or sales in the hijacked accounts. This occurred on more than 150 occasions over the course of 14 months. Nagaicevs &ndash; using the direct, anonymous market access provided to him by various unregistered firms &ndash; traded those same securities at artificial prices and reaped more than $850,000 in illegal profits.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders instituting administrative proceedings against the four electronic trading firms, they allowed Nagaicevs to trade through their electronic platforms without first registering as brokers. Each of the trading firms provided him online access to trade directly in the U.S. markets through an account held in the firm&rsquo;s name. These firms gave Nagaicevs a gateway to the U.S. securities markets while circumventing the protections of the federal securities laws, including requirements for brokers to maintain and follow adequate procedures to gather information about customers and their trading.

145,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Merck & Co. insider who tipped Steven A. Hartung about the pending acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that made drugs to treat Hepatitis C.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in early May 2014, the Insider learned about Mercks' pending tender offer for its common stock in advance of the company's May 9, 2014 announcement that it was going to acquire the entire outstanding outstanding shares of Idenix. The Insider then tipped his close friend, who also traded on the confidential information, and then sold all of his shares, reaping illegal profits of $59,688. On the same day the insider publicly announced the deal, raising approximately $3.85 billion from investors who had purchased shares at the close of trading that day. After the public announcement, IDENix's stock price increased by 229%, and the trader sold his entire position, realizing illegal gains of over $60,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations in his SEC complaint filed today, Steven and his friend agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties of up to three times the amount of their profits.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval. In a parallel action, on March 6, 2017, a federal court in Philadelphia entered a temporary restraining order enjoining Steven from future violations of Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as from violating Section 14(e)(1) and (3) Rule 14e-3, which prohibit traders from disclosing the true nature of a transaction to a third party, including a broker or dealer, from disseminating material, nonpublic information about a potential merger between the two companies. As a result of this conduct, Smith-Schiller, an independent consultant, was required to refrain from communicating this information to third-party third parties and from engaging in unlawful trading. This is the second insider tip that the Commission has uncovered in connection with this insider tipping. A third insider tipped in June 2014 tipped on May 8, 2015, about an impending merger with another company. By that time, Mer&#8217;s CEO had publicly stated that he would be interested in acquiring the shares","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Williamsport, Pennsylvania man has agreed to pay nearly $123,000 to settle charges that he traded on material nonpublic information in advance of Merck & Co.'s June 9, 2014 announcement that it would acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. through a tender offer.  In the complaint filed today in federal district court in Philadelphia, the SEC alleges that Steven A. Hartung was tipped material nonpublic information about the potential acquisition by a relative who worked at Merck.  The complaint alleges that after learning about the potential deal, Hartung bought a total of 3,345 shares of Idenix.  After the deal was announced, Hartung sold the stock for total profits of $59,688.  Hartung is charged with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.  To resolve these charges, Hartung, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, has agreed to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining him from future violations, requiring him to disgorge all of his ill-gotten gains of $59,688, and to pay prejudgment interest of $3,210, and a one-time civil penalty of $59,688.

Colonial Tidewater Realty Income Partners, LLC, James R. Glover, and Sherman T. Hill, 07-CV-2401 (D. Md.)  SEC CHARGES MARYLAND-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH FRAUDULENT OFFERING SCHEME  The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission today charged a Maryland-based investment adviser with defrauding investors out of approximately $13.5 million through the sale of unregistered securities.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore, from approximately May 1998 to May 2012, the investment advisory fraud occurred principally through distribution of a private placement memorandum (PPM) and oral representations that falsely overstated the liquidity of the investments and the expected rates of returns. The PPMs, which Glover drafted, contained inflated property values and misleading descriptions despite the fact that the properties were not owned by the company and were in the process of foreclosure. In doing so, Glover took undisclosed commissions, unjustified ""fees"" and other monies directly from unsuspecting investors totaling $839,000.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that while Hill was the day-to-day operations manager for the business, he was principally responsible for soliciting investors and misappropriating their funds. He enticed investors by making false statements to investors about the financial condition of Colonial and its real estate holdings and, for many, as their trusted friend, they had known for years, to invest their money in his company. As a result, investors were misled to believe that their investments were safe and would yield returns of 7 to 9 percent per year, when, in fact, their investment was not safe because the property had been repossessed, or in foreclosure, without disclosing the nature of its foreclosure or loss of property. Finally, according to The Commission's complaint, Hill and his firm, Signator Investors, Inc., engaged in a fraudulent offering scheme in which they solicited investors through a series of private offerings that included misrepresentations about Colonial, its liquidity and growth prospects. Among other things, these offerings were purportedly intended to provide investors with a ""guaranteed"" income stream to support their retirement savings and to fund their lifestyle. However, instead of","The Securities and  Exchange Commission today announced that three Maryland men have agreed to settle  charges that they defrauded investors in a company that owns and operates  residential and commercial real estate. Boston-based  Signator Investors Inc. and one of its supervisors agreed to settle separate  charges that they failed to supervise two of the men who worked in Signator&rsquo;s Maryland  office. The SEC alleges that  James R. Glover orchestrated the fraud by enticing family, friends, and fellow  church members to become his clients at Signator and invest in Colonial  Tidewater Realty Income Partners, which he co-managed. Most of Glover&rsquo;s clients were financially  unsophisticated and relied on him for investment guidance. Some even described him as &ldquo;another dad&rdquo; or &ldquo;part  of the family.&rdquo;   According to the  SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore against Colonial Tidewater,  Glover, and Colonial Tidewater&rsquo;s co-manager Sherman T. Hill:   Glover  steered approximately 125 clients to purchase partnership units in Colonial  Tidewater. Glover  and Hill provided false and misleading written statements about Colonial  Tidewater&rsquo;s value and financial condition. Glover  lied to investors about the liquidity of Colonial Tidewater&rsquo;s investments and  the expected returns. Glover  and Cory D. Williams, his business partner in Signator&rsquo;s Maryland office, did  not inform clients that they received undisclosed commissions from Colonial  Tidewater when clients invested in the company, thus failing to disclose  conflicts of interest. Glover  misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds.  According to an SEC  order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Signator and Gregory  J. Mitchell, who was a supervisor in Signator&rsquo;s Maryland office:  Signator and Mitchell failed to identify and prevent the alleged fraud conducted by Glover and  Williams. Signator  failed to have reasonable policies and procedures governing consolidated  reports, which could be used to combine all of a client&rsquo;s financial holdings in  a single report. Glover, without Signator&rsquo;s knowledge, inserted clients&rsquo;  Colonial Tidewater holdings into the consolidated reports to create the false impression that Colonial Tidewater  was a Signator-approved investment when it was never authorized for sale by  Signator representatives. Rather  than following Signator&rsquo;s policies and procedures, Mitchell routinely allowed  Glover and Williams to select client files for his review or he provided them a  pre-selected list of names of client files to be reviewed, enabling them to  remove all references to Colonial Tidewater investments before Mitchell reviewed  the records.  Colonial Tidewater, Glover,  and Hill agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges without admitting or denying the  allegations and consented to the appointment of a receiver to take control of  Colonial Tidewater. Under settlements  that are subject to court approval, Colonial Tidewater would be required to pay  $527,844 in disgorgement, $66,542 in prejudgment interest, and a $725,000  penalty. Glover agreed to be barred from  the securities industry and pay $839,128 in disgorgement, $64,977 in prejudgment  interest, and a $450,000 penalty. Hill  agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty. In a separate SEC  order, Williams agreed to settle charges that he violated provisions of the Investment  Advisers Act. Without admitting or  denying the allegations, he agreed to be barred from the securities industry and  pay $94,191 in disgorgement, $9,854 in prejudgment interest, and a $94,191  penalty. Without admitting or  denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Signator and Mitchell agreed to penalties of $450,000 and $15,000 respectively. Signator agreed to be censured and  Mitchell agreed to be suspended from acting in a supervisory capacity for one  year. Funds collected from  all the parties will go into a Fair Fund for injured investors. The SEC&rsquo;s  investigation was conducted by Suzanne C. Abt, Assunta Vivolo, Scott A.  Thompson, and Kelly L. Gibson in the Philadelphia Regional Office and  supervised by G. Jeffrey Boujoukos. The  litigation will be handled by Christopher R. Kelly and David L. Axelrod. The investigation followed an examination  conducted by James O&rsquo;Leary and Aidan Busch of the Philadelphia office under the  supervision of Frank A. Thomas.

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, Civil Action Number 08-CIV-2828 (E.D. Pa.)  SEC CHARGES WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION WITH VIOLATING THE INTERNATIONAL BRIBERY AND BOOKS AND RECORDS provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  The Commission today filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Wabtec Corporation.  W.A.B. Corp. is a Delaware-based manufacturer of low-friction brake blocks and related products for locomotives, freight cars and passenger vehicles, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pioneer Friction Limited (""Pioneer""), is based in western Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that, from at least 2001 through 2005, WABtec made unlawful payments to employees of India's Indian Railway Board (IRB) and Zonal Railways in order to have its competitive bids for government business granted or considered. According to the complaint, none of these payments was accurately reflected on the IRB's books and records and Wabbtec failed to prevent or detect the payments. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the company has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the anti-bribery, internal controls and books-and-records provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. In a related administrative proceeding, on February 13th, a federal district court in Philadelphia entered an order freezing the assets of Pioneer and the related entities in connection with the payment of improper cash payments made by the FIRB to certain marketing agents. Pioneer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1 and 13a-14 thereunder.

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, Civil Action No. 08-CV-706  (E.D.Pa.)  SEC Sanctions Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation for Improper Payments to Indian Government Employees  On February 14, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed two settled enforcement proceedings charging Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (""Wabtec""), which is headquartered in western Pennsylvania, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") in connection with certain improper payments that Wabtec's Indian subsidiary, Pioneer Friction Limited (""Pioneer""), made to employees of the government of India in order to obtain or retain business from the Indian national railway system.  Wabtec manufactures, among other things, brake subsystems and related products for locomotives, freight cars and passenger vehicles.  The Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charging Wabtec with violating the anti-bribery, books-and-records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and seeking a civil penalty.  The Commission also issued an administrative order finding that Wabtec violated the same provisions of the FCPA.  In the administrative proceeding, the Commission ordered Wabtec to cease and desist from such violations, and to disgorge $259,000, together with $29,351 in prejudgment interest.  The Commission also required Wabtec to retain an independent consultant to review and make recommendations concerning the company's FCPA compliance policies and procedures.  In the federal civil action, Wabtec agreed to the entry of a final judgment requiring it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $87,000.  Pioneer, incorporated and headquartered in India, manufactures low and high friction brake blocks for rail operations.  Pioneer's financial results are reported on a consolidated basis as part of Wabtec's consolidated financial statements.  In both its administrative order and federal court complaint, the Commission charged that, from at least 2001 through 2005, Pioneer made over $137,400 in improper cash payments to employees of the Indian government in order to have its competitive bids for government business granted or considered.  As a result of being awarded contracts in 2005, Pioneer realized profits of $259,000.  In connection with the improper payments, Wabtec failed to keep accurate books and records, and failed to devise and maintain effective internal accounting controls.  As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission charged that Wabtec violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Wabtec consented to the ordered relief without admitting or denying either the findings contained in the Commission's administrative order, or the allegations of the Commission's complaint.  In addition, in a separate non-prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice, Wabtec will pay a $300,000 fine.

Blackout Media Corporation, fonnerly known as First Canadian American Holding Corporation (FCAR), and Sandy Winick, Civil Action No.: 07-Civ-1371 (N.D. Cal., filed March 8, 2008)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging a fraudulent scheme to create publicly traded companies without registering the distribution of securities by penny stock issuer, FCAR. The complaint alleges that from April 2002 to May 2004, the company spun off 59 wholly-owned subsidiaries (the ""Subsidiaries""), through unregistered distributions of their securities to FCAH shareholders.  According to the complaint, while the spinoffs were occurring, and no disclosure was made about the financial or business operations of the companies or any of them was required by the SEC. As a result of these spinoff transactions and the subsequent sale of stock to a third party seeking public financing, investors profited by at least $32 million from the alleged misconduct. In a parallel action filed today in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., the Commission charged the defendants with violating the registration and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both defendants have consented to injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, an officer-and-director bar and surrender of all shares of any Subsidiary or its successor, or an order prohibiting the destruction of documents, imposing a cease and desist order and prohibiting any alteration or alteration of records, including proxy statements, in violation of Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 15(d) in Regulation M of Regulation G, as well as Section 17(e) under the antifraud provision of Rule 17a-1.

The SEC alleges that First Canadian and Winick engaged in a scheme to create publicly traded companies through illegal distribution of the securities of more than 50 First Canadian subsidiaries.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from April 2002 to May 2004, First Canadian spun off 59 subsidiaries through unregistered distribution of their securities to shareholders. As alleged in the complaint, these spinoffs had no legitimate business purpose and were instead a means to create publicly traded companies without providing the disclosure required by registration. According to the complaint, while conducting the spinoffs, First Canadian never filed periodic reports with the Commission, and made no meaningful disclosure about the financial and business operations of First Canadian or any of the subsidiaries. The complaint alleges that while First Canadian ""reported"" the spinoffs on Forms 8-K and proxy statements on Schedule 14A, these filings failed to disclose the true nature of the spinoff transactions and that Winick had control over 16.5% of First Canadian's stock through his wife, his friends, and affiliated entities.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the spinoffs, Winick assembled an inventory of public company shells for sale and later sold many of them. In addition, the complaint alleges that Winick traded in the shares of some of these companies and profited by at least $3.2 million from 2004 through 2007.  The SEC's complaint charges Blackout Media and Winick with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 14a-9 thereunder. The complaint also charges Blackout Media with violating, and Winick with aiding and abetting violations of, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and Winick with violating Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 16a-3 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against Blackout Media and Winick, and seeks from Winick an accounting, disgorgement, a penny stock bar, and the surrender of all stock he owns or controls in the companies spun off by First Canadian or their successors.

During the hearing, the SEC presented substantial evidence of fraud committed by Woodbridge prior to filing for bankruptcy.  In a hearing yesterday, the Honorable Judge Kevin J. Carey of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved a settlement Term Sheet presented by the SEC, the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, and Ad Hoc Committees of Unitholders and Noteholders. Among other things, the settlement provides for the appointment of a New Board of Managers consisting of representatives recommended by the parties which will take necessary actions for managing Woodbridge. The settlement also provides for the SEC's consent, not unreasonably withheld, to the retention of a CEO or Chief Restructuring Officer, and the selection of Debtors' professionals.  Judge Carey's Order approving the Term Sheet stated that the resolution is in the best interest of the Creditors, the Committee, the Debtors, their estates, and other parties in interest, and provided the appointment of a New Board of Managers, which will select a CEO or Chief Restructuring Officer for the Debtors. In furtherance of the settlement, the SEC has agreed to dismiss its request in the District Court action for the appointment of a receiver over the Debtors and related entities.

Global Online Direct, Inc., Bryant E. Behrmann and Larry ""Buck"" E. Hunter,Civil Action No. 1:07-CV-0767-WSD (NDGA)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that on November 6, 2007, the Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered judgments as to defendants Bryant E. Behrmann (Behrmann) and Larry ""Buck"" E. Hunter (Hunter), restraining and enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court ordered each defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, the amounts of which will be decided by the Court upon subsequent motion by the Commission.  The defendants consented to the entries of the judgments without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commission's Amended Complaint.  The Amended Complaint, which was filed on July 3, 2007, charged that, since at least October 2005, Global, Behrmann and Hunter have orchestrated a massive Ponzi scheme and conducted an unregistered offering of securities through Global's SPIP. Global, Behrmann and Hunter solicited investors to ""loan"" Global funds for a term of one year in exchange for promised daily interest payments. Depending on the amount invested, Global promised effective annual returns of more than 1,800%. Global purported to generate revenue sufficient to pay investors their promised returns by pooling investor proceeds to purchase distressed inventory, which Global then claimed to resell through various online auction websites, including Ebay and Yahoo! Auctions, as well as through flea markets, street sales and retail storefronts. From October 2005 through March 2007, Global raised approximately $45 million from more than 9,000 investors.  The Amended Complaint further alleged that Global, Behrmann and Hunter failed to disclose to investors that Global's purported business model was wholly incapable of generating the returns promised to investors, and that the vast majority of the returns paid to existing investors were in fact the proceeds invested by later investors - the key hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. The Amended Complaint also charged that Global, Behrmann, and Hunter failed to disclose other material information to investors, including that: (a) as of March 2007, Global was more than $30 million in arrears in honoring investor withdrawal requests and owed investors approximately $265 million - an amount more than $250 million in excess of all assets of Global; (b) even though they had promised investors that their investments were ""secured and backed by actual product inventories,"" they had taken no steps to secure or tie any individual investment to any actual product inventory, and the total value of the inventory was only a tiny fraction of the investments purportedly secured; (c) Global maintained no effective bookkeeping or accounting systems, and thus were completely incapable of tracking or identifying the amounts invested by investors, the returns paid to investors, the cost of inventory purchased, and the proceeds generated through inventory sales; and (d) state cease-and-desist and injunctive orders for prior violations of securities laws had been entered against Global by the states of Pennsylvania and South Dakota, against Behrmann by the states of North Dakota, Pennsylvania and South Dakota, and against Hunter by the states of Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Washington. The Amended Complaint further alleged that, while representing to investors that Behrmann was an attorney and a former judge, Defendants failed to disclose that his law license had been suspended since 1999 for professional misconduct and that the Idaho Supreme Court had found Behrmann to have engaged in ""conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in course of his practice of law.""  Behrmann is the secretary and treasurer of Global and a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Hunter is the president of Global and a resident of La Grande, Oregon.

SEC CHARGES STOCK EXECUTIVE WITH FINANCIAL VIOLATIONS  The Securities &amp;Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Swiss-based U. S. broker-dealer &#8212;UBS&#8221; with violations of the anti-fraud, registration, and antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act. The Commission alleges that from 1999 through 2008, from 2001 through its provision of unregistered brokerage and investment advisory services to thousands of foreign clients to facilitate the ability of those client advisers to maintain undisclosed accounts in Switzerland and other locations outside the US, which enabled them to avoid paying taxes related to those accounts. According to the Commission, the accounts were not subject to record-keeping, examination, or reporting requirements of any federal securities laws. In fact, as a result of acting as an investment adviser to U States cross-border clients, they had ill-gotten gains of at least $380 million. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Complaint, a final judgment permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions and orders the Defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $80,000, plus a $25 million civil penalty, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. Additionally, on May 17, 2008 the Court entered a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of certain defendants and prohibiting the destruction of documents, including documents and correspondence, that were sent to and from the affected clients and were deemed satisfied by their receipt of such documents. Under the settlement, defendants consented to permanent injunctions against future violations and to an order prohibiting them from engaging in any offering or sale of securities in connection with the offering of a foreign securities note. Also, defendant defendants agreed to disgorge $1.1 million that they received from their brokerage services and pay civil penalties in a related administrative proceeding.

UBS AG, 1:09-CV-00316 (JR) (D.D.C. filed Feb. 18, 2009)  UBS AGREES TO PAY $200 MILLION TO SETTLE SEC CHARGES FOR VIOLATING REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an enforcement action against UBS AG, charging the firm with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that UBS's conduct facilitated the ability of certain U.S. clients to maintain undisclosed accounts in Switzerland and other foreign countries, which enabled those clients to avoid paying taxes related to the assets in those accounts. UBS agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins UBS and orders it to disgorge $200 million.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, from at least 1999 through 2008, UBS acted as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser to thousands of U.S. persons and offshore entities with United States citizens as beneficial owners.  UBS had at least 11,000 to 14,000 of such clients and held billions of dollars of assets for them.  The U.S. cross-border business provided UBS with revenues of $120 to $140 million per year.  The SEC also alleges that UBS conducted that cross-border business largely through client advisers located primarily in Switzerland, who were not associated with a registered broker-dealer or investment adviser.  These client advisers traveled to the U.S., on average, two to three times per year on trips that generally varied in duration from one to three weeks.  In many instances, the client advisers attended exclusive events such as art shows, yachting events, and sporting events that were often sponsored by UBS, for the purpose of soliciting and communicating with United States cross-border clients.  UBS also used other U.S. jurisdictional means such as telephones, facsimiles, mail and e-mail to provide securities services to its U.S. cross-border clients.  The SEC further alleges that UBS was aware that it was required to be registered with the SEC.  UBS took action to conceal its use of U.S. jurisdictional means to provide securities services.  Among other things, client advisers typically traveled to the U.S. with encrypted laptop computers that they used to provide account-related information, to show marketing materials for securities products, and occasionally to communicate orders for securities transactions to UBS in Switzerland.  Client advisers also received training on how to avoid detection by U.S. authorities of their activities in the U.S.  As charged in the SEC's complaint, as a result of its conduct, UBS violated Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  To settle these charges, UBS has consented to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently enjoins UBS from further violation of those provisions; (2) orders it to pay $200 million in disgorgement, to be paid together with an additional $180 million in disgorgement that will be paid as part of a settlement of a related criminal investigation; and (3) orders UBS to comply with its undertakings to terminate its U.S. cross-border business and to retain an independent consultant to conduct an examination of UBS's termination of the business.  In connection with a related criminal investigation, UBS has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice pursuant to which UBS will pay an additional $180 million in disgorgement, as well as $400 million in tax-related payments.

While claiming that the investments were for investments in securities and real estate, Vallett in fact used some investor funds for personal expenses and paid off certain investors in his first offering with funds received to invest in one of his later offerings. Vallett also claimed that the investments were for notes to be secured with his personal assets and asset of entities that he owned. However, during a recent examination by Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (FINRA), he provided false documentation suggesting that the collateral exceeded the amount raised.In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Vallett and Vallett &amp; Co. violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants, who are neither registered nor licensed to offer or sell securities, have been manipulating the market for more than a decade, and are in possession of material, non-public information about the manipulation of the company's stock, its purported financial condition and the use of new investor money to pay for personal expenses, including a $20,000 home equity loan, a luxury car, an apartment, travel expenses and an investment in a condominium owned by the same person. The complaint further alleges the scheme was orchestrated by a group of friends and family members who also controlled the firm. According to the complaint, these individuals, along with others, used the information to create the false impression that their stock was trading on the open market, when in fact, it was not trading at all. In addition, as part of their scheme, they sold at least $1.5 million worth of securities to other investors, in amounts that were not disclosed to investors or registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws.

According to the SEC's complaint, the Defendants purported to acquire, manage, and resell companies that provided healthcare services and related technologies for the funds' investment portfolios. Wagner controlled the healthcare funds and their bank accounts and with Lawrence, solicited investors on behalf of the funds. To entice new investors, Wagner and Lawrence falsely inflated the available cash reserves of the funds, which included Downing Investment Partners and Downing Digital Healthcare Group, and revenue from the funds' portfolio companies.

(collectively, ""Defendants""), sold their Wind farms stock to unsuspecting investors for a total of more than $1.5 million in proceeds. In reality, as a result of this scheme, at least five defendants have been enjoined and criminally convicted for securities fraud by a federal court for failing to register their securities with the Commission and for violating the antifraud and registration provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. One defendant has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and the other has been sentenced to 10 years in prison to be followed up by three years of supervised release","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19311 / July 26, 2005  SEC V. U.S. Wind Farming, Inc., William L. Telander, et al., Case No. 05 C 4259 (N. D. Ill, filed July 25, 2005)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on July 25, 2005, the Honorable Milton I. Shadur of  the United Stated District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) temporarily restraining: U.S. Wind Farming, Inc. (Wind Farming), William L. Telander, Raymond J. McNamee, Templar Financial, LLC, Mad World Capital Group, LLC, Time Limit Capital, LLC, Anthony M. Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson Equities, Inc., Charles S. Flemming, Ashlin Capital, LLC, and Kyoto Capital Group, LLC from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and temporarily restraining Wind Farming and Telander from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder in connection with the offer and sale of Wind Farming's common stock.  The Court also entered orders freezing the assets of Wind Farming and Telander, and temporarily barring Wind Farming, Telander, McNamee, Templar Financial, Mad World Capital, Time Limit Capital, Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson, Flemming, Ashlin Capital, and Kyoto Capital from participating in penny stock offerings, prohibited all of these defendants from destroying documents, and required all of these defendants to provide an accounting.  The Commission's complaint also alleged that Michael D. Spadaccini and Oronex, LLC violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act in connection with the offer and sale of Wind Farming common stock. The Commission's complaint alleged that Telander, Wind Farming's CEO and a recidivist who was permanently enjoined and criminally convicted for securities fraud in 1994, caused Wind Farming to improperly issue millions of unregistered shares to McNamee, Necoechea, Flemming, Spadaccini, and entities that they controlled.  The entities these defendants controlled purported to be Pennsylvania accredited investors, but in reality these entities were mere conduits for Telander and Wind Farming to access the public market for financing.  From April 2004 through the spring of 2005, Telander issued millions of unregistered shares to these entities with the expectation that Wind Farming would, in turn, receive payments from the sales proceeds.  After Telander caused Wind Farming to issue McNamee, Necoechea, Flemming, and Spadaccini unregistered shares, through the entities they controlled, these individuals quickly caused the entities they controlled to dump their unregistered shares into the public market.  From June 2004 to May 2005, as these sales occurred, Telander and Wind Farming created artificial demand for Wind Farming stock by issuing false and misleading press releases regarding Wind Farming's business operations, financial condition and business relationships.  At the same time, Wind Farming's website touted the business accomplishments of Telander without disclosing his prior disciplinary and criminal history.  At least Necoechea and Flemming made payments to Wind Farming with proceeds from their sales of unregistered shares at prices buoyed by Telander's and Wind Farming's fraudulent activities.   On June 9, 2005, the Commission entered an order suspending trading in Wind Farming's stock for a ten-day period.  The Complaint seeks the entry of temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions against Wind Farming, Telander, McNamee, Templar Financial, Mad World Capital, Time Limit Capital, Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson, Flemming, Ashlin Capital, and Kyoto Capital.  The Complaint also seeks the entry of permanent injunctions against Spadaccini and Oronex.  Further, the Complaint seeks the entry of temporary, preliminary and permanent penny stock bars against Wind Farming, Telander, McNamee, Templar Financial, Mad World Capital, Time Limit Capital, Necoechea, 20th Century Jackson, Flemming, Ashlin Capital, and Kyoto Capital.   Finally, the Complaint seeks disgorgement of profits from all defendants and the imposition of civil penalties against all defendants.

Osterhout and Prosperity Network, Inc., d/b/a Properity Automated System, Defendants, and Case No.: 06-CV-2318 (N.D. Ga.)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it has filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against William ""Billie"" Ostershouts and his entity, the Private Investment Advisory Network (""PNI""), based in Citrus Heights, Georgia. The Commission's complaint alleges that from as early as July 2005 through the present, defendants have offered and sold interests in a fraudulent pyramid scheme through a series of approximately 25,000 internet websites, owned by either PNI or its investors. These websites tout PAS as a ""100% automated Multi-Income Marketing Portal that Showers You with Hands-Free Cash."" Many of the websites lure investors with outlandish claims of potential profits.  According to the complaint, while Defendants claim that their program is designed to market goods and services, investors earn returns from sales to ""downline"" investors, rather than from the sale of any goods or services to new investors as promised. In fact, as alleged, approximately 80% of these investors have invested at the most expensive ""premier"" level of membership, or $3,895 per month. Many websites touted ""PAS is a multi-income marketing portal that showers you with hands-free cash."" The complaint further alleges, among other things, that the majority of investors who purchased a membership at or above the minimum $49.95 membership were told that they could earn $2,500 a day, without speaking to anyone, &#8220;with no expenses to sell it.&#8221;  In addition, many investors purchased membership memberships at a cost of $1,995, which were then credited to a sponsor who would receive a percentage of additional future membership sales. As a result of this conduct and belief, PIS is alleged to have violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of both the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, O","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19848 / September 27, 2006   Securities and Exchange Commission v. William M. Osterhout and Prosperity Network, Inc. d/b/a Prosperity Automated System, Civil Action No 1:06-CV-2318 (N.D. Ga., filed September 27, 2006)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a Complaint and Application for Emergency Relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to halt an ongoing pyramid-scheme fraud by William M. Osterhout (""Osterhout"") of Citrus Heights, California and his company Prosperity Network, Inc. (""PNI""), also located in Citrus Heights, California.  In the Complaint, the Commission charges that, since at least July 2005, Osterhout and PNI, an entity he controls, have conducted an unregistered and fraudulent offering of securities through the sale of membership interests in the so-called Prosperity Automated System (""PAS"") - a supposed web-based ""marketing portal"" that Osterhout and PNI have claimed to investors will generate ""substantial passive income"" with ""[n]o prospecting,"" ""[n]o advertising,"" and ""[n]o selling.""  In fact, PAS is nothing more than a fraudulent pyramid-scheme that is destined to collapse and leave the vast majority of investors with substantial losses.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants, using a series of approximately 25,000 interconnected PAS websites, have sold more than $15 million in PAS memberships to more than 5,000 individual investors.  The Complaint further alleges that in order to purchase a PAS membership, prospective investors submit their personal information into an existing PAS website and agree to be contacted by a PAS team leader, who then directly solicits the investor.  Investors who choose to purchase PAS memberships receive the following: (1) their own unique replicated PAS website that automatically offers PAS memberships to additional prospective investors; and (2) the services of PAS team leaders to solicit new prospective investors.  The proceeds from an investor's first sale of a PAS membership must be paid to an earlier investor; thereafter, PAS investors retain commissions for each subsequent sale of PAS memberships to new investors while directing part of the sales proceeds to PNI.  Although PAS can purportedly be used to market goods and services in addition to PAS memberships, PAS is designed to generate returns for existing investors based almost entirely upon the sales of new PAS memberships to downline investors.  As there are a finite number of prospective investors who could ultimately choose to invest in PAS by purchasing a membership, PAS is a pyramid-scheme that will collapse when there are no further investors, leaving the majority of downline investors with losses.  The Complaint also alleges that Osterhout and PNI's conduct violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In the Complaint and Application for Emergency Relief, the Commission seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions, an accounting, asset freeze, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Osterhout and PNI.

Spangler, Case Number 2:12-cv-00856 (W.D. Wash.)  SEC Charges Seattle-Area Investment Adviser and Its President with Defrauding Clients  On MayÂ 17, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington charging Seattle area investment adviser and its president, Mark ""Spangler,"" with fraud for secretly investing their clients' money in risky start-up companies.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from at least 2003 through 2011, Spangling and his firm, Thespangler, raised over $56 million for several private funds that he created and managed, including two publicly-traded companies for which he had significant interests. According to the complaint, these funds were intended to invest in equity securities traded in public markets, and were supposed to be invested in publicly traded securities. In reality, however, as alleged, they did not invest the funds as intended. Instead, from 2005 through April 2011 the two private companies paid SPangler $830,000 in fees for ""financial and operational support"" not actually rendered. These payments, which came from the assets of the Private Funds, were hidden from clients who invested the money. At no time did the defendants tell investors - who were already paying TSG management fees - that they had received additional fees from these two companies, resulting in a total of almost $42 million in investor funds being invested into one company. Finally, in April 2012, when the private Funds were unable to satisfy redemption requests, both parties initiated receivership proceedings against them. To settle the SEC's charges, all three defendants consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 206(1) and (2) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in these filings, each defendant has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest and civil penalties, jointly and severally, with respect to all defendants, for a period of five years. Each defendant also has a right to reapply at a later date","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 22371 / May 18, 2012  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Mark F. Spangler and The Spangler Group, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:12-cv-00856 (U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, filed May 17 2012)  SEC CHARGES SEATTLE-BASED FUND MANAGER FOR SECRETLY DIVERTING CLIENT FUNDS TO HIS OWN START-UP COMPANIES  On May 17 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Seattle-based financial adviser and his firm with defrauding clients by secretly investing their money in two risky start-up companies he co-founded.  The SEC alleges that Mark Spangler, a former chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, funneled approximately $47.7 million of client money into these private ventures despite representing that he would invest primarily in publicly traded securities. Spangler served as chairman and CEO of one of the companies, which is now bankrupt. Such risky investments were inconsistent with the investment strategies that Spangler promised his clients and contrary to their investment objectives.  The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Washington also announced parallel criminal charges against Spangler.  According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Seattle, Spangler raised more than $56 million from his clients since 1998 for several private investment funds he managed. Beginning around 2003, without notifying investors in the funds, Spangler and his advisory firm The Spangler Group (TSG) began diverting the majority of client money into two private technology companies he created. One of the companies received nearly $42 million from the funds before shutting down operations. It had long been a cash-poor company with a history of net losses, generating less than $100,000 in revenue during its 11-year history. Yet Spangler continued to treat the funds as the companyâs piggy bank.  The SEC alleges that Spangler also did not tell investors that TSG collected fees for âfinancial and operational supportâ from these companies, which were essentially paying these fees with the client money they had received from the funds. Therefore, Spangler and his firm secretly reaped $830,000 from the companies in addition to any management fees that TSG received from clients.  According to the SECâs complaint, Spangler concealed his diversion of client funds for years. He disclosed it only after he placed TSG and the funds he managed into state court receivership in 2011.  The SECâs complaint charges Spangler and TSG with violating, among other things, the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.  The SECâs investigation was conducted by Karen Kreuzkamp and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office with assistance from Michael Tomars, Peter Bloom, and Christine Pelham of the investment adviser/investment company examination program. Robert L. Tashjian will lead the SECâs litigation.

SEC Charges Kentucky Man with Insider Trading in Connection With Multi-Million Dollar Merger and Acquisition Announcements  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (SEC) today charged Kentucky man with insider trading based on nonpublic information he received from a broker who was in possession of confidential information about merger and acquisition transactions that had been misappropriated from investment banking firms in New York City. The SEC alleges that Gary Force (Force), a 64-year-old Kentucky resident, engaged in highly profitable, unlawful trading in the securities of seven companies that he recommended to a securities broker, James Cooper (Cooper), in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) ofÂ Securities Act, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a penny stock bar. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New YORK today announced criminal charges against Force. According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Force was a temporary employee at Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc. and later Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, where he worked from October 1998 until January 2000. Cooper was an insurance agent prior to his arrest in February 2000 for his role in this insider-trading scheme. Among the people that Cooper tipped was his broker Chad Conner, who in turn tipped at least five of Force's clients concerning a number of these upcoming deals, including one in which Force reaped more than $1.5 million in profits, often obtaining high returns in a matter of days or weeks. As a result of his trading, which occurred from June 1998 through December 1999, force realized a $220,000 profit on each transaction, reaping a total of over $2.3 million.

KENTUCKY BUSINESSMAN GARY FORCE AGREES TO PAY OVER $4 MILLION TO SETTLE SEC INSIDER TRADING CHARGES  The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) today filed an insider trading action against Gary D. Force, the owner of automobile dealerships in Kentucky and Tennessee.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that from June 1998 through December 1999, Force engaged in highly profitable, illegal securities trading based on inside information he received from his broker, Chad Conner, about seven upcoming mergers or acquisitions. According to the complaint, Force knew or was reckless in not knowing that the stock recommendations he received from Conner were based on information misappropriated from two investment banking firms in New York City.  Based on the inside information, Force made substantial investments in these seven stocks, purchasing as much as $1 million worth of stock in a single transaction.  After the deals were announced, Force made more than $1.5 million in profits from his trading, often obtaining high returns in a matter of days or weeks.  Force also shared some of the recommendations with his daughter, who purchased stock in advance of four deals and reaped more than $220,000 in profits.    Conner&#8217;s source for the inside information was James Cooper, one of Conner&#8217;s clients, who obtained the information from a source at the New York investment banks.  The Complaint alleges that Force compensated Cooper by purchasing stock in one of the seven companies on behalf of Cooper and his brother.  Force then authorized Conner to pay $20,000 out of Force&#8217;s account to the Coopers, representing the profits from that stock purchase.  According to the complaint, Force also arranged for and guaranteed $250,000 in loans from his bank to Cooper and his brother, enabling the Coopers to continue to trade on the inside information.  At the time that Force arranged these loans and paid the $20,000 to the Coopers, Force had never met or spoken to them.  Force has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting, without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission&#8217;s Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordering him to pay a total of $4,152,197.  This amount includes disgorgement of Force&#8217;s profits in the amount of $1,515,213 and disgorgement of his daughter&#8217;s profits in the amount of $221,062; prejudgment interest in the amount of $900,709; and a civil penalty of $1,515,213.  The final judgment also enjoins Force from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.  The settlement terms are subject to court approval.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that Force&#8217;s trading was part of a broader insider trading scheme that was launched on the Internet and ultimately involved more than twenty individuals located in and around New York City and Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Eighteen individuals have been convicted criminally for their roles in the scheme and the Commission has also obtained civil judgments against those eighteen individuals, including Cooper and Conner.

Richard Curtiss, United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Civil Action No CV 05289 (D. Conn.)  SEC CHARGES RICHARD C. CURTISS WITH INSIDER TRADING  On December 14, 2005, the Commission filed an insider trading action in the federal district court in Connecticut against Richard Curtis, a former director of corporate development at Gerber Scientific, Inc. (""Gerber"").  The Commission's complaint alleges that, in breach of his fiduciary duty to the company and to its shareholders, Curtis traded on the basis of material, nonpublic information that the private company was preparing to announce a joint venture with another company, and that its earnings would be lower than expected. The complaint further alleges Curtis traded in advance of the March 7, 2000, announcement of a proposed merger between the two companies and, later, that Gerbers' fourth quarter results would fall below public estimates. At the time, he was employed as a Director of Corporate Development with direct and other authority for negotiating the merger and with advance knowledge of these corporate earnings. In his capacity as director, Curtus was responsible for locating potential mergers and acquisitions and developing other business opportunities for Gerb.

Richard Curtiss, Civil Action No. 305CV286 (JBA) (D.Conn. filed February 16, 2005)  RICHARD CURTISS SETTLES INSIDER TRADING CHARGES  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled insider trading case in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Richard Curtiss (""Curtiss"").  In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Curtiss, the former director of corporate development of Gerber Scientific, Inc. (""Gerber""), was responsible for locating potential mergers and acquisitions and developing other business opportunities for Gerber.  The Commission further alleged that by January 2000, Curtiss was responsible for coordinating Gerber's efforts to enter into a proposed on-line apparel venture with another company.  This information about the proposed venture was material and nonpublic.  On March 1 and 2, 2000, while he was working on a draft of the press release announcing the proposed on-line apparel venture, Curtiss purchased a total of 2,000 shares of Gerber stock at an average price of $15.375 per share on the basis of the material, nonpublic information.  On March 7, 2000, Gerber made its announcement of the plan to form the proposed venture with another company.  Gerber's stock price increased to $17.4375, up $0.9375 from the previous day's close.  Curtiss thus enjoyed a profit at that time of $4,125.    The Commission further alleged that by March 24, 2000, Curtiss received additional material, nonpublic information indicating that Gerber likely would miss earnings expectations for the quarter ending April 30, 2000.  On the basis of this information, Curtiss sold 2,500 shares of Gerber stock at $20.50 per share.  When Gerber announced its lowered earnings expectation on April 26, 2000, Gerber's stock price dropped to $11.50, down $3.94 from the previous day's closing price.  By selling his stock in advance of the April 26, 2000, earnings announcement, Curtiss avoided losses of $22,500.   The Commission further alleged that, when Curtiss traded, he did so in knowing or reckless disregard that he was trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information in breach of the fiduciary or other duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Gerber and its shareholders.  As a result of his conduct, Curtiss violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, Curtiss consented to the entry of a judgment (i) permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, (ii) ordering disgorgement of profits and losses avoided of $26,625 plus prejudgment interest of $9,134, (iii) imposing a civil penalty of $26,625 pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act, and (iv) barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Liberty, a Florida resident, his family, friends, and others with orchestrating a multi-million dollar fraud that raised more than $55 million from hundreds of investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, Liberty and his accomplices used numerous shell companies to raise money from investors, many of which were located in Maine. The SEC alleges that Liberty claimed to be the founder of Mozido, Inc., a financial technology company that bought all of MDO's assets and later sold its assets to investors for millions of dollars. In reality, the complaint alleges, as a result of the scheme, millions in investor funds were used to fund Liberty's lifestyle, including chartered flights, travel and entertainment expenses, personal expenses and the funding of a movie production. To conceal his fraud and to avoid detection of potential violations of federal securities laws, he enlisted his attorney, George Marcus, Esq., and two of his companies, BRTMDO Investments, LLC and Family Mobile LLC, to issue securities and one shell company to sell securities as an unregistered securities offering.

In reality, the shell companies either did not own, or were not permitted to transfer, interests in the company.  The SEC also alleges that Michael Liberty and his accomplices lied to investors about Mozido's valuation and finances, the amount Michael Liberty had personally invested in Mozido, and the use of their funds.

The complaint further alleges defendants made misrepresentations to investors about the safety and profitability of these loans and failed to disclose that their investments were being audited by outside auditors and internal accounting firms. In addition, defendants allegedly made false and misleading statements in connection with their sales of securities to their clients. According to the complaints, investors were falsely told their money would be used to fund the purchase of a home, a car, or other luxury goods, when in fact the home itself was being used for a personal benefit. As a result, some investors lost money and were left with little or no money to support their lifestyle expenses. To settle the charges, defendant defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-fraud, books and records, broker-dealer registration requirements and penny stock registration provisions.

The transfer agent, International Stock Transfer (IST), and its owner Cecil Franklin Speight, as well as two Florida-based attorneys James Schmidt II and Jonathan Flom, were previously charged by the SEC for their roles in these fraudulent schemes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., Harrison Katzen, of Lantana, Florida, while employed by IST and at Speight's direction, prepared offering materials used by others to solicit potential investors that touted the purported issuers of the securities being offered and the safety and benefits of investing in their securities.  These offering materials contained numerous materially false and misleading statements.  For example, the offering materials represented that the offering proceeds would be used by the issuers of the securities for business purposes, when in fact most of the investor money was distributed among scheme participants, including Katzen, and spent on funding the ongoing schemes.  The SEC alleges that the two fraudulent schemes that Katzen participated in defrauded approximately 60 investors located in the United States and abroad of approximately $3.2 million.

The complaint further alleges that as a result of this conduct, Salipp's quarterly revenue targets for 2013 and 2014 were not met. Specifically, as alleged, sales to wholesalers increased in February 2013, and the wholesaler inventory levels rose in 2014. As the complaint alleges, by the second quarter of 2014 the stock price fell by more than 30 percent, which was the first quarter to show declines in sales volume. In addition, because the increase in demand was occurring at the same time, it raised questions about the adequacy of sales inventory.

According to the SEC's complaints filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Salix and Derbyshire made false statements to analysts and investors during quarterly earnings calls by significantly understating the amount of Salix drugs that wholesaler customers held in inventory.

The complaints allege that Salix and Derbyshire also failed to disclose in SEC reports that the practice had impacted earnings and presented a significant risk to Salix investors.  Salix is now a subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc., which was previously known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  The alleged misconduct occurred prior to Salix's acquisition by Valeant.

The final judgment orders Pollet to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000. Previously, on November 21, 2006, Judge Townes had entered a partial judgment permanently enjoining Pollet from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

A ""PIPE"" is a private investment in public equity. Specifically, the Complaint alleged that Pollet routinely sold short the publicly traded securities of the PIPE issuers prior to the close of the PIPE transaction in order to lock in gains for SG Cowen's proprietary account.  The complaint further alleged that, in several instances, Pollet's short selling was directly contrary to specific representations in securities purchase agreements that no short selling would take place or had taken place, and that the PIPE shares were being purchased with investment intent. At the time Pollet made these representations on behalf of SG Cowen, he had already started to short sell the securities of these PIPE issuers.

According to the SEC's complaint, Beginning no later than November 2000, MisNER made false statements to a company employee in an attempt to induce the individual into investing more than $1 million in a penny stock company. The complaint further alleges that the press release falsely stated that ""Southwestern had water from the Colorado aquifer for sale,"" subject only to ""drilling and proving up the first well.""   The SEC alleges, however, that these statements were false because, in fact, Southwest did not own any water rights or the value of its water, but had made no effort to develop the infrastructure needed to extract the water and transport it to potential end users. In addition, according to SEC filings filed with the Commission on November 14, 2002 and in its complaint filed on June 26, 2003, it failed to disclose the substantial risks involved with obtaining rights to water in Colorado.

SEC Charges Chicago Resident with Operating a Prime Bank Scheme  On May 28, 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois filed a civil injunctive action in the federal district court in Chicago, Illinois.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Richard D. De Maria, through his entities, operated a prime bank scheme that defrauded at least thirteen investors out of approximately $4.3 million by making material misrepresentations in subscription agreements concerning investments in financial instruments that do not exist. The defendants enticed investors to invest money with them in what the defendants described as ""interest in a financial instrument"" for generating a profit. According to the complaint, instead of purchasing any instruments, deMaria used investor funds for his own personal use and to fund his other business ventures, including his real estate business, his car dealership, and purchases of sports cars. He also allegedly misappropriated over $2 million of investors' money at a Chicago-area dealership that appeared to specialize in sports car sales.

(Judge Kennelly)  The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Chicago-area resident Richard DeMaria yesterday with fraud, alleging that he operated a prime bank scheme that defrauded at least thirteen investors out of approximately $4.3 million.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed on May 29, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that DeMaria enticed his investor victims to invest money with him to purchase interests in a financial instrument for the purpose of generating a profit.  Instead of purchasing any financial instruments, DeMaria misappropriated virtually all of the victims&#8217; money for his own personal use.  The SEC alleges that DeMaria never acquired any financial instruments, which is typical in prime bank schemes.  When investors sought the return of their investments, DeMaria lulled investors with promises that a deal to acquire a financial instrument was imminent.  These promises were false.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, DeMaria misappropriated at least $3.8 million of the investor funds.  He used investor funds for, among other things, his personal use and to fund his other business ventures.  For example, DeMaria used over $2 million to fund his real estate business.  He also spent over $90,000 of investors&#8217; money at a Chicago-area dealership specializing in the sale of sports cars.  DeMaria also used investor funds for travel and expensive meals.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the defendants in connection with an ongoing Ponzi scheme that raised at least $18.2 million from 182 investors.

Investors were told that their money would be pooled and used as collateral to finance the purchase of ""1"" tier-2-day"" notes. The complaint alleges that investors were promised a rate of return that varied between 4% and 6% per month. In fact, these ""prime bank"" instruments did not exist and investors' money was transferred from individual accounts established and maintained for them to large, commingled accounts controlled only by defendants, despite representations that the funds would remain in one of three bank accounts and that said account would ""remain in full equity value or greater than full capital value."" The defendants told investors that they would receive regular monthly returns from participation in a prime bank program, but the returns were not guaranteed against risk of loss. They also failed to disclose that investor funds were being used to pay returns to other investors and not to fund any trading in any bank instrument as represented to them. Finally, the complaint states that none of these defendants has been charged with any violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

IFC is a Virginia corporation with offices in Arlington, Virginia.  Pinkett, who also lists an Arlington, Virginia address, is IFC's chairman and CEO.  Byer and Stevenson are Canadians.  The Complaint alleges that defendants solicited investors in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in the Canadian province of British Columbia, including Abbotsford, B.C.  According to the SEC's pleadings, investors were requested to, and did, send their investments to a bank in Arlington, Virginia.  The SEC's pleadings allege from July 2003 to the present, Defendants solicited from investors a minimum investment of $100,000 in what was promised to be a risk-free program with a monthly rate of return in 2006 of 6% per month, or 72% per year.  In actuality, the ""1st tier medium term bank notes"" that this program purportedly invested in do not exist.  Instead, the complaint alleges that defendants used investor funds to pay the monthly returns in a classic pyramid or ponzi scheme and wired money to banks and entities unrelated to the purported investment program.  On Nov. 1, 2006, the BCSC issued a Temporary Order and Notice of Hearing ordering the defendants to cease trading the IFC investments to residents of British Columbia.  The Commission alleged that the defendants violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"").  For permanent relief, the Commission requested injunctions against future violations, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties as to all defendants.  The Court subsequently entered an order, among other things, temporarily restraining defendants from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)), Rule 10b-5  (17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5) and Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 77(e) and 77q(a)); freezing investors' funds wherever located and all assets of the defendants; prohibiting the defendants from accepting or depositing additional funds from actual or potential investors; requiring an immediate accounting; preventing document alteration or destruction; expediting discovery; and requiring defendants to repatriate all investor funds into the United States.

177,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former MiMedx Group, Inc. executives and two of their companies with orchestrating a wide-ranging fraud designed to artificially inflate the company's reported revenue.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that from 2013 through the third quarter of 2017, the former senior executives of the biotechnology company, which sells products in the form of wound care and surgical allografts, engaged in a pervasive, long-running fraud that resulted in millions of dollars of misstatements of revenue in its financial statements. According to the SEC, these improper revenue recognition schemes allowed Mimedx to meet or exceed its revenue targets. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the executives repeatedly lied to and withheld critical information from the Audit Committee of MiMEDx's Board of Directors, outside auditors, and outside counsel concerning the improper accounting practices with the five distributors. In a parallel action, on November 26, 2019, a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the defendants, appointing a receiver over the assets of each of them and freezing their assets. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all three defendants consented to permanent injunctions prohibiting them from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, or reporting requirements of any issuer, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, investment adviser, nationally recognized statistical rating organization, penny stock, broker-dealer, financial reporting professional, administrative, disciplinary advisor, auditor, registered representative, securities registration, public company accountant, accountancy, auditing, accounting, compliance and compliance provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleges that from 2013 to 2017, MiMedx prematurely recognized revenue from sales to MiMedx's distributors and exaggerated MiMedx's revenue growth. According to the SEC's complaint, MiMedx improperly recognized revenue because its former CEO Parker H. ""Pete"" Petit and former COO William C. Taylor entered into undisclosed side arrangements with five distributors. These side arrangements allowed distributors to return product to MiMedx or conditioned distributors' payment obligations on sales to end users. Petit, Taylor, and former CFO Michael J. Senken allegedly covered up their scheme for years, even after MiMedx's former controller raised concerns about MiMedx's accounting for specific distributor transactions. The SEC also alleges that Petit, Taylor, and Senken all misled MiMedx's outside auditors, members of MiMedx's Audit Committee, and outside lawyers who inquired about these transactions.  The SEC's complaint, filed today in the Southern District of New York, charges all defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that MiMedx violated the reporting and recordkeeping provisions of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and that Petit, Taylor, and Senken aided and abetted MiMedx's violations of these provisions and the antifraud provisions or that Petit and Taylor acted as control persons for MiMedx's violations.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Petit, Taylor, and Senken directly violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and, as to Petit and Senken, 13a-14 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, penalties, officer-and-director bars against Petit, Taylor, and Senken, and clawback of bonuses and other incentive-related compensation paid to Petit and Senken during the alleged fraud.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, MiMedx has agreed to a settlement and to pay a $1.5 million penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against David ""Tether"" Etter, the former CEO and chairman of the board of directors of Solomon Technologies, Inc., a manufacturer and seller of electric boat engines.  According to the Commission's complaint, from April 2004 through February 2005, Tetter transferred 200,000 shares of his stock to Bristol Charter, LLC, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Tarpon Springs, Florida, in exchange for a sailboat and potential cash. The complaint further alleges that, while bound by an agreement prohibiting him from trading in Solomon stock (the ""lock up agreement""), the lock up agreements were intended to reassure investors that major Solomon shareholders would not cause the company's stock price to fall by selling off large blocks of stock after the initial public offering. Despite knowing this and despite knowing that the transfer directly violated the Lock Up agreement and rendered Solomon&#8217;s representations to investors untrue, he filed to make yet another required filing with the SEC disclosing his change in stock ownership. To further his fraud, on January 7, 2004, Solomon filed an Amended Annual Report for its 2004 fiscal year that failed to disclose his large stock transfer and consequently overstated the amount of outstanding stock he owned. As a result of this misconduct, and in a related administrative proceeding filed on August 5, 2006, it was ordered by the Honorable Paul J. Conte, U. S. District Judge, Eastern Division, that all defendants be enjoined from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 17(c) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1,13d-2(d) and 16a3 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting violations by Solomon and its related entities of registration and antifraud provisions.

Tether in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Until August 2004, Tether was the chief executive officer and a director of Solomon Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation. Solomon's securities have been registered with the Commission since January 2004. The Commission's complaint alleges that in April 2004, Tether fraudulently misrepresented his beneficial ownership of Solomon stock in Solomon's amended annual report filed on Form 10-KSB/A for the year ended December 31, 2003. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Tether transferred 200,000 shares of his Solomon stock while that stock was subject to a publicly disclosed lock up agreement and that the stock was used to pay for a 47-foot catamaran. However, as alleged in the complaint, Tether failed to disclose in the Form 10-KSB/A that he had transferred his locked up stock. Additionally, the Form 10-KSB/A overstated Tether's beneficial ownership of Solomon stock by the 200,000 shares he had already transferred. Moreover, the complaint alleges that Tether failed to file timely a Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities on Form 4 disclosing the transfer of the shares.  Based on this conduct, the Commission alleges that Tether violated Sections 10(b), 13(g) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13d-1(d), 13d-2(b) and 16a-3 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Solomon's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder.

According to the Commission's complaint, from December 2005 through at least March 2007, McKKnight, through his companies, sold interests in several investment programs that purported to generate returns of 15 to 18 percent per month. The complaint alleges that, instead of investing the money as promised to investors, the defendants diverted it to other purposes, including to pay for renovations to his wife's home, car repairs, credit card bills, and other personal expenses. As a result of the conduct alleged to have taken in more than $71 million in investor funds, they have incurred losses totaling approximately $3.6 million. In addition to these losses and the loss of investor money, Mcnight has also transferred funds to two entities he controls, Lido Consulting, Inc., Healthy Body Nutraceuticals and Lindenwood Enterprises LLC.

McKnight, et al, Case No. 08-11887 (E.D. Michigan, filed May 5, 2008)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 5, 2008, the Honorable Judge Paul V. Gadola of the United Stated District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued an Asset Freeze Order against Gregory N. McKnight (McKnight) and Legisi Holdings, LLC (Legisi Holdings) as defendants, and against Legisi Marketing, Inc. (Legisi Marketing), Lido Consulting, LLC (Lido Consulting), Healthy Body Nutraceuticals (HBN), and Lindenwood Enterprises, LLC (Lindenwood) as relief defendants. The Asset Freeze Order froze all assets of McKnight, Legisi Holdings, Legisi Marketing, Lido Consulting, HBN, and Lindenwood. In addition, Judge Gadola issued an Order Appointing a Receiver over all assets of McKnight, Legisi Holdings, Legisi Marketing, Lido Consulting, HBN, and Lindenwood.  The SEC's complaint, filed May 5, 2008, alleged that McKnight and Legisi Holdings conducted a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in which, between December 2005 and at least November 2007, they raised approximately $72 million from more than 3,000 investors in all 50 states and several foreign countries through the Legisi website at www.legisi.com. According to the SEC's complaint, McKnight represented that he would invest the offering proceeds in foreign currencies, commodity futures, stocks and real estate and promised to pay interest of as much as 15 percent per month from the profits from his investments. The SEC's complaint further alleges that throughout the period of the offering, McKnight represented to investors that his investments were profitable and were generating the promised returns. The complaint charges that, contrary to these representations, McKnight invested only approximately $33 million of the offering proceeds and that, rather than earning profits, these investments resulted in millions of dollars in losses. The SEC's complaint further charges that Defendants used approximately $27.5 million of the offering proceeds to make payments of purported profits to prior investors and were, thus, operating a Ponzi scheme, and that McKnight used $2.2 million of investor funds to pay for his personal expenses and to make payments to his relatives, Jennifer McKnight, Danielle Burton, and Theresa Burton. The SEC's complaint charges that Defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to the emergency relief already obtained, the Complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against McKnight and Legisi Holdings. The Complaint also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from the defendants and relief defendants and the imposition of civil penalties against McKnight and Legisi Holdings.

Jewels, Cheryl E. Kalinen, and Robin A. Friedman, Civil Action No.: 07-CV-1131 (D. Mass.) (filed May 21, 2006)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based company of which it is a part. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, alleges that from 1999 through 2002, SyCamore granted millions of ""in the money"" options to its officers and employees while failing to inform its investors and auditors of the nature of these options and, in fact, misleading them into believing that the company granted these ""at-the-money"" option grants at a time when the stock price was lower and therefore more favorable to the option recipient. For several instances, the defendants waited until the end of a month or a quarter before making the grants, but made it appear as though they were made at some earlier point -sometimes weeks earlier - when stock prices were lower than the exercise price. In some cases, they used hindsight to select dates that coincided with days on which the Company's stock had fallen below its closing price, rendering the options worthless. By contrast, another set of approximately 1.6 million options was granted at an earlier date, resulting in millions dollars in unreported expenses.   In a parallel action the Commission filed, on May 23, 2005, it charged the former chief financial officer, former vice president of financial operations and former director of operations, with misappropriating stock option compensation expenses in connection with the backdating of stock options grants.

Friedman, United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-11166 (DPW)  SEC Charges Sycamore Networks and Three Former Officials in Options Backdating Case  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil enforcement action against Sycamore Networks, Inc., an optical networking company based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, as well as its former Chief Financial Officer Frances M. Jewels, former Director of Financial Operations Cheryl E. Kalinen, and former Director of Human Resources Robin A. Friedman in connection with the backdating of stock options to employees over several years and the failure to disclose options-related expenses to the company's auditors and investors.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts, alleges that Sycamore's unreported options-related expenses during its fiscal years 2000 through 2005 totaled nearly $250 million. The Commission's complaint further alleges that Jewels and Kalinen repeatedly backdated options grants between October 1999 and July 2002 to prices at or near monthly or quarterly low points for the company's stock, providing employees with options with prices at which they could purchase shares that were lower than the market price at the time the options actually were granted. The Commission also alleges that Jewels and Kalinen falsified grant approval documentation and that they personally benefited from grants of below-market options.  The Commission's complaint describes an internal memorandum that outlines a plan to grant options at below-market prices to five company employees and keep the company's outside auditors from discovering these grants. The memo, drafted by Kalinen and provided to Jewels and Friedman, analyzed the risk that the company's outside auditors would uncover the conduct. Friedman participated in the plan by altering or creating, or causing others to alter or create, company personnel and payroll records so that they would reflect inaccurate start dates for the employees, according to the Commission's complaint.  All defendants have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, on the following terms:  Jewels has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-9, and 16a-3 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Jewels will disgorge ill-gotten gains of $30,000 (plus prejudgment interest on that amount of $4,980.04), reimburse Sycamore (pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) for $190,000 in cash bonuses she received during the period of the fraud, and pay a civil monetary penalty of $230,000. Jewels also will be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years, and, in a related administrative proceeding, will be prohibited from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney or accountant for a period of five years.  Kalinen has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting her from violating Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-9 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Kalinen also will disgorge ill-gotten gains of $28,000 (plus prejudgment interest on that amount of $7,060.71) and pay a penalty of $150,000.  Friedman has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting her from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

SEC CHARGES FLORIDA EMPLOYEES WITH FRAUDULENT TEMPORARY RESTRAINING SCHEME   The Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging fraud in connection with the sale of securities by a Florida resident and his wife.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that, between November 14, 2006 and the end of May, 2008, JamieL. SOLOW, age 48, a resident of Ft.auderdale, Fla., was employed as a temporary representative for Samco Financial Services, Inc. (""Samco""), a registered broker-dealer based in Hillsboro Beach, Florida. The complaint further alleges, in 2006, that the SEC filed an enforcement action against Mr.Solow in which it charged him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) &nbsp;  Section 15(e) (the ""Securities Act"") and Rules 17a-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-11, as well as the registration provision of Sections 13(d), 13d and 16(i)(2) under the federal securities laws.

Solow in Contempt for Failure to Pay Disgorgement and Prejudgment Interest of Over $3.4 Million and Orders that He Surrender to the Custody of the U.S. Marshals to be Incarcerated Until Such Time as He Complies with the Court's Order to Pay.On January 15, 2010, the Honorable Donald M. Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida found Jamie L. Solow in contempt of court for failing to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of over $3.4 million ordered to be paid in a securities fraud case brought against him by the SEC. The sanction for Solow's contempt is that on January 25, 2010, he must report to the U.S. Marshal's Office to be taken into custody and incarcerated until he complies with the Court's order to pay.Following a nine-day trial in January of 2008, a jury found Solow liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), and for aiding and abetting violations of the net capital, books and records, and reporting provisions committed by one of his former firms, Archer Alexander Securities Corp. (""Archer Alexander""). The Commission's complaint alleged that in 2003, while associated with Archer Alexander, Solow engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme involving inverse floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations (""inverse floaters""), a highly complex, risky, and volatile type of mortgage-backed security derivative. The Commission's complaint also alleged that during 2003 to 2006, while associated with Archer Alexander and another registered broker, dealer, SAMCO Financial Services, Inc., Solow sold inverse floaters to retail investors with conservative to moderate investment objectives or low net worth for whom these complicated, volatile, and risky securities were unsuitable. Many of Solow's customers, including numerous elderly or retired investors, incurred heavy or total losses when they liquidated their accounts or were unable to meet margin calls involving the inverse floaters.In its Order of Civil Contempt, the Court found that rather than pay the amounts ordered to be paid in the final judgment entered against him, Solow engaged in a purposeful campaign of asset dissipation by transferring his assets to his wife. Between January 2008 (the month in which his jury trial commenced) and April 2008 (several months after the jury's verdict against him), Solow and his wife liquidated securities accounts totaling over $1.5 million. Some of those funds were used to pay ""asset protection attorneys"" retained by Mrs. Solow a mere four (4) days after the jury verdict was entered against her husband. Moreover, in March 2008, Solow signed a $5.2 million mortgage on his residence in Hillsboro Beach. The proceeds of the mortgage were used to fund a CD now held by a Cook Islands trust for the benefit of Mrs. Solow. Notwithstanding these transfers, Solow claims to be a ""ward of his wife"" even though the Solows' accumulated wealth has been derived exclusively from income earned by Mr. Solow alone. Finding that Mr. Solow's inability to pay the judgment was self-created, the Court noted that ""Solow still lives a luxurious lifestyle, enjoying the benefits of the money he has made over the years, yet he refuses to repay the victims of his fraud. Such a situation cannot stand.""Separately, the SEC filed a complaint for fraudulent transfer and foreclosure of equitable liens against Mrs. Solow that is also currently pending before Judge Middlebrooks.

182,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Nevada resident Donald G. Blakstad and two companies he controlled with conducting an offering fraud that raised approximately $3.544 million from at least 14 investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, between July 2015 and May 2019, BLAKSTAD raised funds through three entities he owned and controlled: (1) Midcontinental Petroleum, Inc., a purported oil, gas, and alternative energy resources company; (2) Energy Sources International Corporation (ESI), and Xact Holdings Corporation, a company he formed to acquire a Canadian manufacturer of industrial vehicle components; and (3) Capital One International Corp. (Canadian Company).  The SEC alleges that, in connection with these three issuers, Blackstad told investors that their money would be used to fund start-up and other costs related to energy exploration, extraction and storage, including the purchase of a stake in a nightclub and a luxury automobile, the creation of cryptocurrency mining operations in Houston, Texas, as well as to pay for personal expenses, such as cash withdrawals, casino and restaurant expenses and payments for a Mercedes Benz convertible convertible note. The complaint also alleges, among other things, that the defendants used the majority of investor proceeds for their personal benefit, spending funds on personal entertainment, vacations, hotels, restaurants, shopping sprees, personal credit card payments and to make securities trading in the company's common stock.

According to the SEC's complaint, instead of using investor funds as promised, Blakstad misappropriated at least $2.2 million of investor funds.  Blakstad allegedly spent the investor funds on personal entertainment, the purchase of a stake in a night club, and a luxury automobile.  In July 2019, the Commission charged Blakstad for his role in a separate insider trading scheme.

(FS), a provider of application delivery networking technology that optimizes the delivery of network-based applications and the security, performance and availability of servers, data storage devices and other network resources.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 2009 through 2010, John ""Kinnac"" Kinnocan, of Portland, Oregon, and his consulting firm BroadBroadband, which was purportedly in the business ofproviding to its clients legitimate research about publicly traded technology firms, but which often provided non information to his own clients, many of whom were portfolio managers and analysts at prominent hedge fund and mutual fund investment advisers, across the country. According to the complaint, Kinnac paid his clients tens of thousands of dollars per year for their ""services"" and generated hundreds of millions of Dollars in annual revenues for Broadbroad during 2009 and 2010. The complaint also alleges in its complaint that in July 2010 and August 2009, when Kinniac sought information from a source who worked at FS (the ""FS Source"") regarding FS's upcoming quarterly earnings all-nouncement, he provided the FS Source with oral and email updates of the confidential information.

John Kinnucan and Broadband Research Corporation, Civil Action 12-CV-1230 (SDNY) (AJN) (AJP)  SEC Charges Oregon-Based Expert Consulting Firm and Owner with Insider Trading in Technology Sector  On February 17, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging John Kinnucan and his Portland, Oregon-based expert consulting firm Broadband Research Corporation with insider trading.   The charges stem from the SEC&#8217;s ongoing investigation of insider trading involving expert networks. In a parallel criminal case, Kinnucan has been arrested and charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud.  The SEC has charged 22 defendants in enforcement actions arising out of its expert networks investigation, which has uncovered widespread insider trading at several hedge funds and other investment advisory firms. The insider trading has occurred in the securities of 12 technology companies &#8212; including Apple, Dell, Fairchild Semiconductor, Marvell Technology, and Western Digital &#8212; for illicit gains totaling nearly $110 million.   The SEC alleges that Kinnucan and Broadband claimed to be in the business of providing clients with legitimate research about publicly-traded technology companies, but instead typically tipped clients with material nonpublic information that Kinnucan obtained from prohibited sources inside the companies. Clients then traded on the inside information. Portfolio managers and analysts at prominent hedge funds and investment advisers paid Kinnucan and Broadband significant consulting fees for the information they provided. Kinnucan in turn compensated his sources with cash, meals, ski trips and other vacations, and even befriended some sources to gain access to confidential information.   According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Kinnucan&#8217;s misconduct occurred from at least 2009 to 2010, a period during which he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenues for Broadband. Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from well-placed employees at a variety of publicly-traded technology companies.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint specifically alleges that in July 2010, Kinnucan obtained material nonpublic information from a source at F5 Networks Inc., a Seattle-based provider of networking technology. On the morning of July 2, Kinnucan learned that F5 had generated better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter of its 2010 fiscal year, with the public announcement scheduled for July 21. Within hours of learning the confidential details, Kinnucan had phone conversations or left messages with several clients to convey that F5&#8217;s revenues would exceed market expectations. At least three clients &#8212; an analyst and two portfolio managers &#8212; caused trades at their respective investment advisory firms on the basis of Kinnucan&#8217;s inside information. The insider trading resulted in profits or avoided losses of nearly $1.6 million.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint, which charges Kinnucan and Broadband with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, requiring them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations.

SEC Charges Beaufort, South Carolina Mayor with Insider Trading  The Securities &amphampf.com today filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in San Francisco against William ""Bill"" R. ""Rauach."" The Commission's complaint alleges that, in August 2006, executives of Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (""Advanced Cell""), a biotechnology company that specializes in developing human embryonic stem cell technology, told Bill Rausch that the company was about to disclose a breakthrough stem-cell technique. Though aware the information was confidential, Rruch began buying Advanced cell stock in multiple brokerage accounts he opened in his name and in the names of his children. The complaint further alleges, when the announcement of the technology breakthrough on August 23, 2006 caused the stock price to soar more than 360 percent.  According to the complaint, the news was not yet public and would be significant news to investors. In a parallel action, on July 25, 2007, a number of prominent commentators criticized and questioned the development of a new human cell technique for creating human stem cells from a single embryonic cell without harming the embryo's developmental potential. As a result of this criticism, Advanced and its shareholders lost approximately $60,000 in investor funds.

Cal. filed July 15, 2008)  SEC Charges Mayor of Beaufort, S.C., With Insider Trading in Stock of Biotech Company  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the mayor of Beaufort, S.C., with insider trading on non-public information that he obtained while doing consulting work for a California biotechnology company. According to the Commission's complaint, Mayor William J. Rauch purchased stock in Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., immediately after one of its executives informed him about a breakthrough embryonic stem cell technique that the company was about to disclose publicly. Rauch was told the information was confidential, and he had previously signed an agreement with the company that barred him from using confidential company information for his own benefit. Rauch has agreed to settle the Commission's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges that an Advanced Cell Technology executive told Rauch on August 3, 2006, that a science journal would soon be publishing an article reporting Advanced Cell's development of a new technique for creating stem cell lines without harming embryos, which the company believed might alleviate concerns about stem cell technology.  According to the Commission's complaint, Rauch called a securities broker and opened accounts in his name and his children's names on the same day he received the confidential information. On August 9 and 14, after further discussions with the Advanced Cell executive, Rauch telephoned his broker and purchased more than $11,000 of Advanced Cell stock in his children's accounts. On August 23, Advanced Cell publicly announced its embryonic stem cell development, and its stock price jumped 360 percent from $0.40 to $1.83 per share. The stock price declined to $0.96 per share on August 25, still 140 percent above the price just before the announcement. Even with the price decline, Rauch's potential profit on his stock purchases two weeks earlier, had he sold, was more than $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Rauch has consented to an injunction from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and has agreed to pay $20,708 in disgorgement, $2,576 in prejudgment interest, and a $20,708 penalty.

The complaint further alleges that the defendants used numerous customer accounts and other FA numbers to conceal their identities and to evade the restrictions on excessive trading by the broker's use of multiple customers and brokerage account numbers. As a result of their misconduct, over $4.6 million of commissions were paid to brokers in the Boston branch of Prudential Securities, Inc. (PSI), a publicly-owned holding company that traded on the New York Stock Exchange and whose principal clients invested in mutual funds whose markets were tracked by hedge funds and imposed quantitative or qualitative restrictions. In addition, as alleged, each of the defendant brokers used multiple accounts for the same clients to hide the fact that they had not yet been blocked and thus were unable to detect and limit the volume and frequency of trades. Moreover, these brokers made it more difficult for these funds to process transactions they would otherwise have rejected, thus causing the fundcompanies to reject the trades by default.

The SEC's complaint, filed May 22, 2019, alleges that from January 2017 through March 2018, Pacheco conducted a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities through two California-based companies he controls, IPro Solutions LLC and IPro Network LLC (collectively, ""IPro"").  IPro raised more than $26 million from investors by selling instructional packages that provided lessons on e-commerce.  Investors also received ""points"" that could be converted into a digital asset known as PRO Currency.  Investors who contributed additional funds could earn a mixture of cash commissions and additional convertible points by recruiting new investors into the IPro network.  As alleged in the complaint, however, IPro was a fraudulent pyramid scheme.  IPro's inevitable collapse was hastened by Pacheco's fraudulent use of investor funds, which included, among other things, the all-cash purchase of a $2.5 million home and a Rolls Royce.  Pacheco's misappropriation accelerated the rate at which IPro became unable to pay the commissions and bonuses due its investors.  The complaint further alleged that Pacheco's offer and sale of IPro instructional packages constituted an unregistered sale of securities because the IPro instructional packages involve (i) an investment in a pyramid scheme; and/or (ii) an investment in the PRO Currency digital assets, and therefore must be registered with the SEC unless an exemption applies. No registration exemption applies to Pacheco's offer and sale of IPro instructional packages.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Pacheco with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

As a result, investors were left with a total of approximately $15.6 million in losses, which the Commission alleges was the result of Bennett's fraudulent scheme and the use of investor proceeds for her personal benefit. To cover up the fraud,","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has charged Bradley C. Mascho, a Maryland-based financial adviser and the onetime CFO of DJB Holdings, LLC, with aiding and abetting an offering fraud involving the sale of over $20 million in convertible and promissory notes.  On August 25, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint charging Dawn J. Bennett and her company, DJB Holdings, LLC, with fraud in connection with their sale of notes backed by the company.  According to the complaint, Bennett repeatedly misled investors regarding the financial condition of DJB Holdings, LLC and her plan to divert millions of dollars in investor funds to personal use.  The complaint also alleged that Bennett perpetuated her fraud by, among other things, lying to regulators and repaying investors with loan proceeds obtained through loan applications that substantially overstated her net worth.  Today, the SEC amended its complaint to add Mascho as a defendant.  The amended complaint alleges that Mascho aided and abetted Bennett's fraud by various means, including preparing false financial statements and related offering materials, lying to regulators and to his employer regarding his knowledge of and role in the sale of notes, facilitating Bennett's efforts to target his firm's brokerage customers, and attempting to disguise certain note sales by creating new, ""backdated"" notes as well as false affidavits misrepresenting the details of the note offering.  In a parallel case, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland unsealed criminal charges against Mascho.  The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to identify whether they are registered professionals and to search for any disciplinary history. Seniors often are targets of investment fraud. The SEC previously issued an alert warning seniors to look out for red flags of fraud when making an investment decision.  The amended complaint charges Mascho with violating Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and with aiding and abetting Bennett and DJB Holdings, LLC's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC alleged that, in August 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1.45 million for the benefit of China Energy Corporation.  The funds were destined for certain of China Energy's shareholders by way of Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  The complaint alleges that Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of this money for his and Quicksilver's own use and benefit, including $500,000 to make a four-day loan to a Nevada real estate company.Â  According to the complaint, the borrower failed to repay the principal or interest as planned.  Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman did not timely forward China Energy's funds to DTCC, despite repeated requests. Quicksilver and Shinderman also made a series of misrepresentations in response China Energy's and DTCC's requests for the funds. Â Quicksilver ultimately paid DTCC approximately six weeks later, after recovering the loan principal from the real estate company.  The complaint also alleges that Quicksilver untimely filed an independent accountant's report with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 31, 2013.

S. District court in the United State of Nevada charging a former investment adviser with orchestrating a Ponzi scheme that raised more than $10 million from over 150 investors.  The Commission's complaint alleges that since at least 1998, Shelby Martin raised money from investors through a variety of false and misleading statements. According to the complaint, Martin told most of his investors that he was going to invest their funds in private companies to take them public. To other investors, he told them that their money would be used to provide working capital to companies in financial distress. The complaint further alleges Martin gave the investors notes that promised a rate of return between 15% and 50% per year, and that the return of principal at the end of the term was usually for a period of six or twelve months. Contrary to Martin's claims, however, neither Martin nor his investment advisory firm, DM Enterprises Inc., nor its principal, was registered with the SEC in any capacity.

March 6, 2009)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced that on March 6, 2009, it filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina to halt an ongoing Ponzi scheme. The Complaint was filed against Shelby Dean Martin (""Martin""), D. Martin Enterprises, Inc. (""DM Enterprises"") and DM Ventures, LLC (""DM Ventures""). The Complaint alleges that Martin is a resident of Mooresville, North Carolina, and has served as president of DM Enterprises and as the managing member of DM Ventures. The Complaint further alleges that DM Enterprises is a North Carolina corporation formed in 1985 that has its principal place of business in Mooresville, North Carolina. The Complaint also alleges that DM Ventures is an entity that was formerly registered in the State of Nevada as a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Mooresville, NC.  The Complaint alleges that since at least 1998, Martin, operating through DM Enterprises and DM Ventures, has raised more than $10 million from over 150 investors in North Carolina and in several other states through a variety of false and misleading statements. The Complaint alleges that Martin told most of his investors that he was going to invest their funds in private companies that he would take public, and told other investors that their money would be used to provide working capital to companies in financial trouble. According to the Complaint, Martin told investors that they would not lose their principal investment and that they would receive anywhere from a 15% to 50% rate of return on their investment. Further, the Complaint alleges that Martin personally guaranteed the promissory notes he gave investors and, in several instances, told investors that their principal was insured. The Complaint alleges that Martin did not invest the money in companies as he claimed, but instead pooled investor funds in the bank accounts of DM Enterprises and DM Ventures, and used those funds as they were received from later investors to pay Ponzi returns to earlier investors.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint further alleges that Martin has violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Muozio orchestrated a pump-and-dump scheme by causing International Business Ventures Group, Inc.

According to the complaint, on November 12, 2008, after receiving $25,000 in monthly payments from a friend of his who helped arrange the public purchase of a public company, MuZio began buying and selling shares in his personal brokerage account and, shortly thereafter, caused the trading to reverse split 1 for 923, leaving the bank with approximately $1.5 million in ill-gotten gains.

In particular, the complaint alleges that Muzio drafted and caused IBVG to issue materially false and misleading press releases, arranged for the publication of research and analyst reports that touted the company's stock, and regularly bought and sold the company's stock through accounts he controlled at various broker-dealers.

Flowserve Corporation, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action Number 1:08-CV-00294 (RWS) (filed February 22,2008)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil injunctive action in the U.

According to the Commission's complaint, from at least 2001 through 2003, two or three of these subsidiaries, acting through third-party agents, authorized or paid kickback payments totaling $646,488 through the use of under-the-table ""after sales service fees"" (ASSFs) through contracts that were either made or authorized by the Iraqi authorities. The kick back payments were typically made in cash by suppliers holding the contracts, and another $173,758 were authorized through sales agents. In reality, the kick-backs had the effect of diverting funds from the escrow account and into an Iraqi slush fund. As a result, FlOWServe either knew or was reckless in not knowing or failing to properly record the nature and nature of certain of those payments, as well as in its failure to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to detect and prevent the illicit payments.

Flowserve Corporation, Civil Action No. 08 CV 00294 (D.D.C.) (EGS)  SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against Flowserve Corporation For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program &#8212; Company Agrees to Pay Over $6.5 Million in Civil Penalties, Disgorgement of Profits, and Prejudgment Interest    The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Flowserve Corporation (""Flowserve"") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Flowserve is a Texas-based manufacturer of pumps, valves, seals, and related automation and services to the power, oil, gas, and chemical industries. The Commission's complaint alleges that from 2001 through 2003, two of Flowserve's subsidiaries entered into a total of twenty contracts in which $646,488 in kickback payments were made and another $173,758 were authorized in connection with sales of industrial equipment to Iraqi government entities under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the ""Program""). The kickbacks were characterized as ""after-sales service fees"" (""ASSFs""), but no bona fide services were performed. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by Flowserve's subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account and into an Iraqi slush fund. The contracts submitted to the U.N. did not disclose that the illicit payments were included in the inflated contract prices.  According to the Commission's Complaint:  A French Flowserve subsidiary, Flowserve Pompes, entered into fifteen Program contracts involving kickback payments of $604,651. Flowserve Pompes agreed to, but did not ultimately make, an additional $173,758 in improper ASSF payments under four additional contracts. Delivery under these four contracts had not been completed by the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Senior officials at Flowserve Pompes, including the subsidiary's President, developed two different false cover stories to conceal the ASSF kickback payments. The company's internal accounting records falsely indicated that Flowserve Pompes paid a Jordanian agent a ten percent fee on each contract to cover the cost of installing and commissioning the equipment. In reality, the agent provided no such services. The contract documents that Flowserve Pompes sent to the U.N. for approval painted a different, but equally false, picture. These documents omitted any reference to after sales services or related installation fees. Instead, to cover the cost of the illicit ASSF payments, the company's U.N. contracts inflated the unit price of each piece of equipment without disclosing the price increases, or the reason for them, to the U.N. Flowserve Pompes also signed a side letter to the Iraqi ministry to pay the ten percent, and failed to disclose the letter to the U.N. Knowing that the kickback payments had to be received before the goods would be allowed across the border, Flowserve Pompes paid its agent immediately. The agent then made the kickback payment by depositing cash into an Iraqi-controlled account in Jordan.  Flowserve's Dutch subsidiary, Flowserve B.V., entered into one contract involving an ASSF kickback payment of $41,836. The contract was for the supply of water pump spare parts to the Iraqi government-owned South Gas Company. In August 2001, officials of Flowserve B.V. met with the company's agent and were advised that the agent would have to pay a ten percent kickback on the transaction on Flowserve B.V.'s behalf, for which the agent would need reimbursement. Flowserve B.V.'s controller chose to conceal the payment by increasing the cost of the purchase order by ten percent and passing the difference back to the agent. In September 2001, Flowserve B.V. agreed to pay a supplemental commission &#8212; euphemistically labeled a ""special project discount"" &#8212; to the agent to cover the amount of the kickback. Upon receiving its supplemental commission payment, the agent paid the ten percent kickback to the South Gas Company on Flowserve B.V.'s behalf.  Flowserve either knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were either offered or paid in connection with these transactions. Flowserve failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments. Flowserve's accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the company's payments. The company's books falsely characterized the ASSF payments either as payments for services actually performed or as agent commissions.  Flowserve, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $2,720,861, in profits, plus $853,364 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000,000. Flowserve will also pay a $4,000,000 fine pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. Flowserve B.V. will enter into a criminal disposition with the Dutch Public Prosecutor pursuant to which it will pay a fine.  The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Flowserve and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee.

They are alleged to have violated the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, registration and record-keeping provisions, among other things, of Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4)-8(A), as well as the registration provisions under Sections 5(c), 17 (a), 13 (b)(2)(A)(B), 12(d)(b","On October 16, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the two co-owners of a now-defunct New York-based private equity firm with defrauding the firm's advisory clients and pocketing millions in fees.  One of the co-owners consented to a judgment, which was entered on October 19, 2018, without admitting or denying the allegations, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from March 2013 to February 2014, Alexander C. Burns, the majority owner and control person of Southport Lane Management, LLC, acquired insurance companies and thereby obtained the ability to control the investment decisions for the insurance companies and those companies' related reinsurance trusts.  Burns allegedly used fraudulent transactions, which he recommended through his affiliated registered investment adviser, Southport Lane Advisors, LLC, to covertly steal money from the insurance companies and related reinsurance trusts.  Burns's alleged scheme ultimately led to at least five insurance companies having insufficient assets to pay policyholder claims, and the companies were placed into receivership.  The SEC further alleges that Andrew B. Scherr, a co-owner of Southport Lane, aided and abetted Burns' fraud by acquiring assets that were worthless or overvalued and which were sold by Burns to his advisory clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Burns with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and with aiding and abetting  violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (3) of the Advisers Act by the affiliated private equity firm and investment adviser.  The complaint also charges Scherr with aiding and abetting Burns' violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Burns consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  The judgment further provides that the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and the imposition of civil monetary penalties, will be determined at a later date.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Nathaniel I. Kolodny, John Lehmann, Doreen Rodriguez and Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.

Heidi Ann Gamer, Gamer Economic Systems, LLC, and Gamer Media Partners, Corp., Civil Action 1:14-cv-02650-0DE (N.D. Ga.)  SEC Charges Colorado Resident With Defrauding Investors in Interactive Software and Technology Offering   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charging a Colorado resident and two companies she controlled with fraudulently selling at least $771,900 of investments to more than three dozen investors. The complaint alleges that, between August 2011 and May 2013, Heidi ""Hank"" Gamer of Colorado, who resided in Colorado at the time of her alleged fraud, raised funds for Gamer's personal use, including paying for restaurant dining, shopping, rental housing, vacation travel, pet grooming and casino gambling. Gamer also allegedly diverted investor funds to pay for a condominium that she rented in Atlanta, her domestic partner and others, as well as for her personal expenses.  According to the Commission's complaint, from August 2012 to May 2014, the defendants raised approximately $371,400 from 17 investors in various states who wired money to, or sent checks for deposit into, their GES bank account. According, in connection with both offerings, they told prospective investors that they would receive quarterly financial statements from the companies, but that no such licensing rights were acquired. In fact, according to Gamer and GMP, she diverted a significant portion of the funds she raised for personal purposes, such as spending money on restaurant and shopping trips, rent, entertainment, retail, gambling, home renovations, car payments and a $2 million partnership with the Atlanta Falcons to use a ""MetaData project"" and to purchase groceries, gas, liquor and other personal items. She also falsely told investors she had secured lucrative contracts or funding commitments from other companies to develop and market interactive software products. However, these contracts never existed and, rather than investing the money as promised by the agreements Gamer had made in her capacity as CEO of Gamer. Instead, all she received was money from her own personal spending, which she used to make restaurant meals, grocery shopping and retail expenses, to buy designer clothing, jewelry, designer clothes, cosmetics, electronics, a home in Malibu, Calif., and gambling tickets to casinos","On August 15, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") filed an action in federal court in Atlanta charging a Colorado Springs, Colorado resident and her two companies with running a $771,900 offering fraud targeting investors in various states.  Victims of the scheme included, among others, individuals who participated in substance-abuse support programs.  Investors were told that funds raised would be used by the companies to acquire interactive technology licensing rights for products such as smart-phone applications, or ""apps,"" that the companies planned to develop and market.  False statements about contracts and licensing deals that did not exist also were used to solicit investors.  Throughout the fraud, significant amounts of investor funds were diverted for such non-business expenses as casino gambling, vacation travel, and shopping.  Named in the Complaint are:  Heidi Ann Gamer (""Gamer""), 41, a resident of Colorado Springs, Colorado;&nbsp; Gamer Economic Systems, LLC (""GES""), a Colorado limited liability company based in Colorado Springs, Colorado for which Gamer served as CEO; and&nbsp; Gamer Media Partners Corp. (""GMS""), a Georgia corporation based in Atlanta for which Gamer also served as CEO.    The Complaint alleges:  Beginning in 2011, Gamer began soliciting individuals for investments in GES, telling them that funds raised would be used as operating capital.  Gamer falsely told prospective investors that GES had secured licensing rights for certain products.  After investors provided their funds, Gamer diverted sizeable portions of the monies raised for her personal expenses, including gambling in Las Vegas and a vacation in Mexico.&nbsp; In 2012, Gamer moved to Atlanta, where she created GMP and offered and sold GMP shares in exchange for investor funds which she again claimed would be used for company operating expenses.  Gamer also told prospective investors that GMP had secured high-dollar contracts with a movie studio, a college and the Atlanta Falcons football team.  No such finalized deals or funding existed.  Gamer again diverted investor funds for her personal use, including her condominium rent, pet grooming, and to help send an acquaintance to a private California weight-loss resort.  Ultimately, Gamer raised from investors approximately $400,500 through GES and $371,400 through GMP, respectively.  Among those targeted by Gamer's scheme were friends and acquaintances, some of whom Gamer met through substance-abuse support programs.     The complaint alleges that Gamer, GES and GMP by virtue of their conduct, directly or indirectly, violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with pre-judgment interest and penalties against each of the defendants.

Cal. filed May 15, 2007)  SEC CHARGES FORMER CEO AND CFO OF PEGASUS WIRELESS CORPORATION WITH FRAUD  On May 14, 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that former CEO Jasper ""Jasper"" Knicker and COO Stephen ""Jack"" Durland engaged in a fraudulent scheme to raise more than $30 million from investors.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that beginning in November 2006, Pegasus, a once high-flying technology company based in Fremont, California, and its then-president and CEO, Jasper N. knabb, fraudulently touted a series of significant acquisitions that caused Pegasus' stock price to rise precipitously, briefly giving the once-heralded penny stock a market capitalization of over $1.4 billion. The complaint also alleges the defendants falsely claimed in SEC filings that Pegasus had issued hundreds of millions of Pegasus shares, which they then dumped on individual investors and the open market throughout 2006 and 2008, as Pegasus's share price declined to pennies. According to the Complaint:   From June 2005 and through approximately January 2007, defendants Knick and Durand, through their companies, created and sold Pegasus stock to individuals and entities they controlled. They used the proceeds to support their extravagant lifestyles, including the purchase of homes, boats and sports cars.&nbsp; The defendants also lied about how Pegasus was financed, falsely claiming in reports and press releases that the key acquisitions Pegasus touted were personally financed. In truth, however, they did not have any legitimate claim to these shares and received no compensation from Pegasus. As a result of the scheme, Defendants Knipp, Nabb's wife, Nancy Speer, Wilson, Aero-Marine, Inc., and others, who received millions in proceeds from the stock sales, sold the shares to themselves and to other investors in violation of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants Nippon Kn","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 21060 / May 27, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Pegasus Wireless Corporation, Jasper Knabb, and Stephen Durland, Case No. 09-2302 (BZ) (ND Cal. filed May 26, 2009)  SEC CHARGES WIRELESS COMPANY EXECUTIVES IN $30 MILLION STOCK DUMPING SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of securities fraud charges against Pegasus Wireless Corporation and two of its senior officers who defrauded investors by illegally selling hundreds of millions of Pegasus shares they secretly controlled and lying about the transactions in company filings.  The SEC alleges that former CEO Jasper Knabb of Anchorage, Alaska, and Little River, S.C., and former CFO Stephen Durland of West Palm Beach, Fla., together reaped more than $30 million through their securities law violations, using the funds to support their extravagant lifestyles including the purchase of homes, boats, and sports cars.    According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Knabb and Durland created Pegasus from a dormant shell company around 2005.  They then touted several acquisitions in a series of press releases, causing Pegasus&#8217; stock price to soar and briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $1.4 billion.  Unbeknownst to investors, however, Knabb and Durland are alleged to have secretly controlled hundreds of millions of Pegasus shares through nominees, which they sold to individual investors and dumped on the open market through 2008.  Pegasus saw its share price steadily decline to under a penny.  As alleged in the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Knabb and Durland accomplished their scheme by issuing hundreds of millions of shares to individuals and entities they controlled, including Knabb&#8217;s mother-in-law, his sister-in-law, his then-mistress, and an entity ostensibly managed by Knabb&#8217;s personal pilot.  The nominees unloaded the shares and funneled millions of dollars to Knabb, Knabb&#8217;s wife, and Durland.  Knabb and Durland reported none of these transactions in reports with the SEC, and instead falsely told investors they owned only minimal amounts of stock and received no compensation from Pegasus.  The SEC further alleges that Knabb and Durland falsely claimed in numerous SEC filings that much of the stock was issued to satisfy a business debt, when in reality this &#8220;debt&#8221; was entirely fabricated through phony documentation.  By February 2008, Pegasus had issued more than 75 percent of its total outstanding shares in this fraudulent manner.  The forged documents and false SEC filings concealed the fact that Knabb and Durland were, in essence, printing shares and diluting the interests of innocent shareholders to enrich themselves.   The SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, charges Pegasus, Knabb, and Durland with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Pegasus is also charged with violating the books-and-records requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, and Knabb and Durland are charged with aiding and abetting Pegasus&#8217; violations.  All three defendants are charged with violations of the registration requirements embodied in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of Securities Act.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint also charges Knabb and Durland with falsifying Pegasus&#8217; books and records in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1, falsely certifying Pegasus&#8217; quarterly and annual reports in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and with stock ownership reporting violations under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder.  Finally, Durland is charged with making false statements to an accountant in connection with an audit in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2.  The SEC seeks injunctive relief and disgorgement from the defendants, as well as civil penalties and officer-and-director bars against Knabb and Durland.  The SEC also seeks to recover assets from two relief defendants &#8212; Jasper&#8217;s wife Tammy Knabb, 41, also of Anchorage, Alaska, and Little River, S.C., and Aero-Marine, LLC, a Nevada entity secretly controlled by Knabb &#8212; who received money through the misconduct.

Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, Louis R. Tomasetta, Eugene F. Hovanec, Yatin D. Mody, and Nicole Kaplan, Civil Action No 2:11-CV-006006 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES VITESSE SEMICONDUCTOR, ITS PRINCIPALS, AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH STOCK OPTIONS BACKDATING SCHEMES  The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that, from at least September 2001 through 2006, the company engaged in an elaborate channel stuffing scheme to improperly record revenue on stock option grants.  According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in about September 2000 and not ending until April 2006 and continuing through the relevant period, defendants Louis ""Tom"" Tomaseetta of Camarillo, California, former Chief Executive Officer and former Controller and Chief Financial Officer Eugene ""Eugene"" Hovanec of Agoura Hills, Calif., former Executive Vice President of Finance and CFO and Controller Yasin D'Avino, a resident of Thousand Oaks, CA, participated in a scheme by which they caused the Company to immediately recognize revenue and record invalid accounts receivable for product shipped at period end to its largest distributor, Nu Horizons Electronics Corp, even though it had an unconditional right to return all of its product. The effect of this fraud was to materially inflate the revenue reported in its financial statements in 14 quarters from September 1 through early 2006. As set forth, Tomasetta and Hovaec intentionally selected grant dates that were different from the dates on which the Compensation Committee had actually approved and granted the options. In order to conceal the true age of these accounts and the false appearance that the grants had been approved by the compensation committee, Hoviec and Kaplan then directed that cash receipts received by customers be misapplied to these aged invalid receivables. These options represented over 60% of all the total options awarded from 1995 to 2006 to newly hired and existing employees and officers.

Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, Louis R. Tomasetta, Eugene F. Hovanec, Yatin D. Mody, and Nicole R. Kaplan, Case No. 10 CIV 9239 (JSR). (S.D.N.Y, filed December 10, 2010)SEC CHARGES VITESSE SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION AND FOUR FORMER VITESSE EXECUTIVES IN REVENUE RECOGNITION AND OPTIONS BACKDATING SCHEMESThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges in federal district court for the Southern District of New York against California-based integrated circuit maker Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation and four former senior executives of Vitesse â co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Louis Tomasetta, former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Eugene Hovanec, former Controller and Chief Financial Officer Yatin Mody, and former Manager and Director of Finance Nicole Kaplan. The SEC alleges that Vitesse, through the former senior executives, perpetrated fraudulent and deceptive schemes during 1995 to April 2006 to inflate revenue from shipment of Vitesse's products and to backdate stock options to employees and officers by failing to record millions of dollars of compensation expense. The SEC alleges that all four former executives engaged in the revenue recognition fraud from 2001 to 2006 and that Tomasetta and Hovanec orchestrated the options backdating from 1995 to 2006. The four executives left Vitesse in 2006.Vitesse has settled the matter by agreeing to be permanently enjoined and to pay a $3 million civil penalty. Mody and Kaplan have each agreed to a bifurcated settlement that provides they will be permanently enjoined and ordered to pay disgorgement, and that any civil penalty will be determined later by the district court. Mody has also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC's case against Tomasetta and Hovanec is contested.The SEC's complaint alleges that during September 2001 through April 2006, Tomasetta, Hovanec, Mody, and Kaplan engaged in an elaborate channel stuffing scheme in order to improperly record revenue on product shipments. They caused Vitesse to immediately recognize revenue and record invalid accounts receivable for product shipped at period end to its largest distributor, even though the distributor had an unconditional right to return all of the product. The right of return was accomplished through undisclosed side letters and oral agreements. As a result, as alleged in the complaint, Vitesse materially inflated the revenue it reported in its financial statements in 14 quarters from September 2001 through early 2006.The complaint further alleges that the defendants compounded their fraudulent revenue recognition practices by failing to timely record credits related to the invalid accounts receivable that were generated by the distributor's return of product. As further alleged, in order to conceal the true age of the accounts receivable from Vitesse's external auditor, Hovanec and Kaplan then directed that cash receipts received by Vitesse from the distributor and other customers be misapplied to these aged invalid receivables.In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that from 1995 to 2006, Tomasetta and Hovanec engaged in a scheme to backdate stock option grant dates for their personal benefit and the benefit of other Vitesse executives and employees. The complaint alleges that Tomasetta and Hovanec disregarded the dates on which Vitesse's Compensation Committee actually approved and granted the options. Instead, they intentionally selected grant dates in the past based on low points in the company's stock price in order to assign favorable exercise prices for the options. They also used hindsight to reprice option grants as Vitesse's stock price declined. In total, as alleged, Tomasetta and Hovanec backdated or repriced 40 option grants to employees and officers, representing over 60% of the total options that Vitesse awarded during the period.As alleged in the complaint, Tomasetta and Hovanec collectively reaped millions of dollars in illicit profits from exercising backdated options. Despite representing in Vitesse's periodic filings made with the Commission that Vitesse did not grant in-the-money options and complied with applicable accounting rules, Tomasetta and Hovanec intentionally manipulated grant dates in order to award in-the-money options and failed to ensure that Vitesse properly recorded compensation expenses for the backdated grants. As a result of the backdating, Vitesse failed to record approximately $184 million in compensation expense, overstating its pretax income or understating its pretax loss by as much as 45% annually for its fiscal years 1996 through 2005.The complaint further alleges that after the Wall Street Journal questioned Vitesse in November 2005 about the legitimacy of its option granting practices, Tomasetta and Hovanec engaged in a cover-up to hide some of their prior backdating. As alleged in the complaint, between November 2005 and April 2006, Tomasetta and Hovanec lied to Vitesse board members and to Vitesse's auditor by falsely telling them that past option grants were proper and correctly accounted for in the company's books.The SEC alleges that in furtherance of their cover-up, Tomasetta and Hovanec fabricated minutes of two non-existent 2001 meetings during which Vitesse's Compensation Committee purportedly granted stock options. Tomasetta and Hovanec inserted these fabricated minutes into the stock option administrator's computer and turned back the clock on the computer thereby creating the false appearance that the minutes had been written at the same time as when the purported meetings occurred. Tomasetta also inserted the dates of these two phantom meetings into his Palm Pilot thereby creating the faÃ§ade that these two meetings had actually happened. Also, as further alleged, on or about December 2005, Hovanec directed his assistant to create a third set of fabricated Compensation Committee meeting minutes to substantiate another backdated grant date from 2003.Vitesse, Mody, and Kaplan have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, on the following terms:Vitesse consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9; and (2) ordering Vitesse to pay a $3 million civil penalty.Mody consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director of any public company; (3) requiring him to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $105,604 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $56,716, for a total of $162,320; and (4) providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court will determine whether a civil penalty is appropriate and the amount of any such penalty. Mody also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, permanently suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.Kaplan consented to entry of a judgment: (1) permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a 1, and 13a 13; (2) requiring her to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $31,050 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $16,445, for a total of $47,495; and (3) providing that, upon motion of the Commission, the court will determine whether a civil penalty is appropriate and the amount of any such penalty. Kaplan also consented to the issuance of an administrative order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, permanently suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.These settlements are subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The settlement with Vitesse takes into account the company's cooperation in the SEC's investigation.The complaint against Tomasetta and Hovanec alleges that each of them violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud, record-keeping, financial reporting, internal controls, lying to auditors, and equity transaction reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Tomasetta is also charged with violating the proxy provisions of the Exchange Act. The complaint also alleges that Tomasetta and Hovanec violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were false and misleading. The SEC's complaint against Tomasetta and Hovanec seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with interest, civil monetary penalties, and officer and director bars.Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today filed criminal charges against Tomasetta and Hovanec, and announced that Mody and Kaplan have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

The Commission's complaint alleges that from May 2007 until October 2009, Nicholson, a licensed broker, and PIE, an Irvine, California based broker-dealer, solicited investments in two limited partnerships, Energy Opportunity Fund-VI, LLLP, EOF VI and VII, while omitting to inform new investors that historically the operations had been almost completely unsuccessful. According to the complaint, defendants used a variety of methods to sell the funds, including sales through licensed salespeople associated with Macarthur and unlicensed salesmen employed by Nicholson. In soliciting investments for these entities, Defendants claimed that the investments earned returns of 15% to 20% annually, but that 75% of investor proceeds would be used for investment in well enhancement and drilling operations. The complaint further alleges, however, that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that their projections and disclosures were materially misleading. For example, in a March 2009 letter to investors, they stated that, ""Your fund is positioned for greater growth and yield potential than ever before,"" and that ""your investments are quite resilient to risks that may have sunk other oil investments."" In reality, according to their representations, none of the offerings generated positive returns; (1) only 50 percent of investors funds were used to pay commissions, (2) 85% was used as unregistered sales staff, 13% had no experience in oil and gas operations; and (3) the vast majority of funds raised were to be paid to licensed agents or NASDIFRA broker dealers.&nbsp;  In addition, as a result of their misrepresentations about future prospects and returns from the wells, investors were being burdened with expenses that were unrelated to those investments, such as sales commissions and finder's fees.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21924 / April 8, 2011  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Paul Nicholson and Professional Investment Exchange, Inc., Civil Action No. SACV 11-546 JVS (RNBx) (U.S.D.C./C.D. Calif.).  COMMISSION SUES CALIFORNIA BROKER IN CONNECTION WITH $8.2 MILLION OIL-AND-GAS FRAUD  Today, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action against California-resident Paul N. Nicholson, and his former firm, Professional Investment Exchange, Inc. (&#8220;PIE&#8221;), alleging that they directed two fraudulent oil-and-gas offerings.  According to the complaint, from May 2007 through October 2009, Nicholson and PIE fraudulently  raised approximately $8.2 million from investors through two limited partnerships, Energy Opportunity Fund &#8212; VI, LLLP and Energy Opportunity Fund &#8212; VII, LLLP.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges, in particular, that Nicholson, who formerly operated broker-dealer Macarthur Strategies, Inc. (&#8220;Macarthur&#8221;), and PIE, an entity Nicholson controlled, misused and misappropriated investor funds, including, among other things, using investor funds to pay undisclosed commissions to unlicensed salespeople, to pay Macarthur&#8217;s expenses and to pay undisclosed personal salary and expenses.  The complaint also alleges that in communications with potential and existing investors, Nicholson engaged in conduct that operated as a fraud and deceit on investors, including by omitting material information about the use of investor proceeds and about the past performance of Nicholson&#8217;s and PIE&#8217;s oil-and-gas ventures.&nbsp; The complaint further alleges that Nicholson sold unregistered securities and that he operated PIE as an unregistered broker-dealer.  In early 2010, Nicholson transferred control of PIE to new management and deregistered Macarthur.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&#8217;s complaint, and subject to court approval, Nicholson and PIE have consented to the entry of judgments that would enjoin them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of  the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Nicholson has also agreed to pay disgorgement of $234,081 with prejudgment interest of $10,722.   The Commission will ask the Court to impose a civil money penalty against Nicholson.  Nicholson has also agreed to entry of a Commission order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or from participating in an offering of penny stock.

LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 20891 / May 10, 2002  Securities and Exchange Commission v.Â LERNOUT &amp; HAUSPIE SPEECH PRODUCTS N.V., Civil Action No. 3:02-CV-00707 (D.D.,C.)  SEC CHARGES COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL WITH FRAUD  The Commission announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging a company and its principal with fraud and other violations of the antifraud provisions of a federal securities law. The complaint alleges that the company, headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, has violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Lernout and his company. In its action, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar and an order barring the firm from serving as an investment adviser to a public company for five years, as well as a bar from appearing or practicing before an SEC examination. Without admitting or denying the allegations in its complaint, Lornout consented to the entry of an injunction and ordered him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, which is subject to approval by the court. According to his sworn statement of financial condition, filed in federal district court in Washington on May 9, 2001, in connection with the alleged fraudulent conduct of L.A. Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

As part of its settlement with LTL, it also agreed to be enjoined from participating in any offering or sale of any product that does not conform to its stated business objectives, including, but is not limited to: (1) to comply with certain federal, state, or local securities laws; (2) with a right to reapply for a period of ten years from the date of issuance of securities; and (3) require that, at the appropriate time, that any alteration or alteration be made to any of","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, D.C.  Litigation Release No. 17782 / October 10, 2002  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1648 / October 10, 2002  The Commission Files Accounting Fraud Action against Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products, N.V. Civ. No. 1:02CV01992 (D.D.C.)  Today the Commission announced the filing of a civil injunctive action in United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products, N.V., a developer, licensor, and provider of speech and language technologies, headquartered in Ieper, Belgium and Burlington, Massachusetts.  The complaint alleges that, from 1996 through the second quarter of 2000, while its common stock was listed on the Nasdaq National Market System and Nasdaq Europe, Lernout &amp; Hauspie engaged in a variety of fraudulent schemes to inflate its reported revenue and income.  The result of this conduct was an international financial scandal, the destruction of Lernout &amp; Hauspie as an operating company, and a loss of at least $8.6 billion dollars in market capitalization, borne by investors in Belgium, the United States and elsewhere.    According to the Commission's complaint:  The Dictation Consortium and Brussels Translation Group Transactions  Between 1996 and 1999, Lernout &amp; Hauspie improperly recorded over $60 million in revenue from transactions with two Belgian entities: Dictation Consortium, N.V. and Brussels Translation Group N.V. These entities were formed for the specific purpose of engaging in transactions to allow Lernout &amp; Hauspie to claim revenue from its own research and development activities, which otherwise would not have resulted in reported revenue unless and until the projects resulted in marketed products.  Lernout &amp; Hauspie subsequently acquired both of these companies on terms that repaid the amounts they had previously paid to Lernout &amp; Hauspie, plus a substantial profit.  Because the transactions were, in substance, disguised loans and not sales or service transactions, Lernout &amp; Hauspie should not have recognized revenue from those transactions under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.    The Language Development Companies  By late 1998, the revenue boost obtained by Lernout &amp; Hauspie from the Dictation and BTG transactions had waned.  To bolster its reported revenue, Lernout &amp; Hauspie launched a new and elaborate fraudulent scheme to, in essence, create additional customers.  These new customers, dubbed &quot;Language Development Companies&quot; (or &quot;LDCs&quot;), enabled Lernout &amp; Hauspie to claim revenue of $102 million in license fees and $8.5 million in prepaid royalties in 1998 and 1999 combined, giving the false impression of exponential growth.  The LDC revenues were not separately identified by Lernout &amp; Hauspie in its financial statements, but instead were buried in overall revenue figures.&nbsp;  The LDCs were structured in a manner that masked their actual role at the time of their creation.  All were private companies.  Most were incorporated in Singapore, although they had no actual operations in that country.  The &quot;managing director&quot; of many of the Singapore LDCs was a Belgian national associated with Lernout &amp; Hauspie.&nbsp;  Lernout &amp; Hauspie, in its public disclosure, contended that the LDCs were formed to develop speech recognition and translation software applicable to various regional languages.  In actuality, the LDCs were little more than shell companies created, like Dictation and BTG, as a means for Lernout &amp; Hauspie to improperly fabricate revenue.  The LDCs had few, if any, employees, and were dependent on Lernout &amp; Hauspie personnel for research and development activities.  None of the LDCs ever produced any significant product.&nbsp;  Lernout &amp; Hauspie supplied or arranged for others to supply financing for at least certain of the LDCs.  For example, in late 1999, Lernout &amp; Hauspie solicited an investment bank in Bahrain to help in the search for investors for two LDCs.  The investment bank advanced Lernout &amp; Hauspie $8 million for technology licenses for the LDCs, with the understanding that Lernout &amp; Hauspie would repurchase the licenses at a substantial premium (representing a 25% internal rate of return) should the investment bank be unable to locate investors to fund the LDCs.&nbsp;  Thus, to the extent Lernout &amp; Hauspie obtained funds from the LDCs, these funds were subject to material conditions imposing significant potential liabilities on Lernout &amp; Hauspie.  Lernout &amp; Hauspie, however, did not disclose these arrangements and did not reflect its potential liabilities to the LDCs on its balance sheet.  The Fraudulent Korean Transactions  From September 1999 to June 2000, L&amp;H reported approximately $175 million in sales revenue from its Korean operations (&quot;L&amp;H Korea&quot;).  The purported dramatic growth in sales from its Korean subsidiary accompanied the inflation of the price of L&amp;H stock.  The majority of this revenue was fraudulent.&nbsp;  L&amp;H Korea engaged in &quot;sales&quot; subject to written and oral side agreements that did not appear in the L&amp;H Korea contract files.  These terms included, in some instances, agreements by L&amp;H Korea not to pursue collection of license fees unless and until the &quot;customer&quot; generated sufficient revenue from use of the L&amp;H software to cover those fees.&nbsp;  To prevent uncollectible receivables from remaining on L&amp;H Korea's books, thereby raising questions about the quality of the company's reported earnings, a series of transactions with four Korean banks were staged to give the impression that the receivables had been factored to those banks on a non-recourse basis.  In fact, L&amp;H Korea entered into side agreements with the banks requiring L&amp;H Korea to maintain blocked deposits to cover the amounts of the &quot;factored&quot; receivables, which the banks could apply to satisfy any collection shortfalls.  Thus, these transactions were essentially fully secured loans from the banks to L&amp;H Korea, rather than sales of receivables from L&amp;H Korea to the banks.&nbsp;  In another scheme to disguise that its escalating accounts receivable did not reflect genuine sales, L&amp;H Korea arranged to have third parties &quot;purchase&quot; the licensing agreements from the original customers.  The transferees would then obtain loans, collateralized by L&amp;H Korea assets but not reflected in L&amp;H Korea's books, and use the proceeds to pay L&amp;H Korea through the original customers.  By this means, L&amp;H Korea was, in effect, paying down its own receivables, while creating the appearance of successfully collecting payments from customers.  Subsequent Events  The Commission's complaint further alleges that:  During the last quarter of 2000, as information about the company's financial fraud became public through the press, the price of Lernout &amp; Hauspie stock declined dramatically, falling from a high of $72.50 in March 2000 to $.76 on December 29, 2000.  On December 6, 2000, the common stock of Lernout &amp; Hauspie was de-listed by Nasdaq.  Thereafter, Lernout &amp; Hauspie voluntarily de-listed from Nasdaq Europe in March 2001.  Lernout &amp; Hauspie common stock is currently quoted on the &quot;Pink Sheets&quot; disseminated by Pink Sheets LLC.&nbsp;  On November 29, 2000, Lernout &amp; Hauspie filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware.  On December 27, 2000, Lernout &amp; Hauspie filed a voluntary petition under Belgium's insolvency statutes.  Both courts determined that reorganization and recovery were not possible, and the company is currently in liquidation proceedings in the U.S. and Belgium.  According to the Commission's complaint, the conduct described above violated the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13a-16 thereunder.  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against future violations by Lernout &amp; Hauspie of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York; the Belgian Ministry of Justice (pursuant to the provisions of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in effect between the United States and Belgium); and the Jersey Attorney General.    The Commission's investigation is continuing with respect to other persons and entities.

202,"On August 21, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former registered representatives, Minish J. Hede and Kevin Graetz, with acting as unregistered brokers by engaging in a prohibited practice called ""selling away.""  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the defendants sold securities to investors from their registered broker-dealer firm, instead of following investor-registration rules that required them to only sell investments approved by the firm.  According to the SEC, they sold Belize Infrastructure Fund I, LLC (Belize Fund) notes to at least 21 customers of the brokerage firm they were associated with, while knowing that their firm had declined to approve the investment. The complaint further alleged that, as a result of their conduct, customers lost approximately $9.6 million in investments, and the firms customers suffered significant losses. In a parallel action, on August 20, 2018, a federal court in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the two defendants, temporarily enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a)(1) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, which will be deemed satisfied by a restitution order entered against them by FINRA in connection with the sale of securities by HEDDERS and their affiliated entities, Belmopan Infrastructure Finance Corp.

As alleged, by selling a security that was not approved by the firm, Hede and Graetz engaged in a prohibited practice called ""selling away.""  The complaint alleges that Hede and Graetz profited through the commissions from the sales, while the firm's customers suffered significant losses.  The SEC charged Belize Fund and its owner, Brent Borland, in 2018, alleging that Borland misappropriated more than $5.98 million of funds obtained from investors in Belize Fund notes and used the stolen principal to fund his family's lavish lifestyle.

According to the SEC&#8217;s Complaint, Powers purchased 18,000 shares of shares at market price that same day, realizing proceeds of approximately $64,645. The complaint further alleges Powers received a draft earnings release on August 6 that reflected that both its attendance and revenue would increase by more than 8% from the same time period in 2017, and that he traded without pre-approval by his employer. Without admitting or denying the allegations in his SEC complaint or any other reasonable basis for his conduct, Power has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $65,829, which will be deemed satisfied by the payment of restitution to be determined by a jury at a later date. In a parallel action, on March 8, 2020, Judge James O'Connor entered a temporary restraining order against Powers and ordered him to disgorge $63,766, plus interest, for a period of five years, against him for an amount equal to his trading profits.

205,"On September 30, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Rand Heckler, a former registered representative, and his company, with defrauding an elderly investor and the investor's son out of approximately $755,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, in 2015, while claiming to manage a successful hedge fund, he solicited investments from the wife of a brokerage customer who had recently received a life insurance payment from her husband's death. The complaint alleges that, after falsely promising Investor A that this investment would pay substantial dividends and that the funds would be used to fund his own lifestyle and to pay for his mortgage, car payments and a country club membership, as well as to repay his son's mortgage and car credit card debts. In reality, according to his account statements, they never invested the money as he claimed, but instead misappropriated the investors' funds for luxuries such as country clubs, spa visits and fine dining. To conceal and sustain the fraudulent scheme, Defendants periodically provided investor A and Investor B with account statement statements that purported to show investments made by the sham fund in stocks and other securities. As part of the scheme to conceal the fraud, Hecklers allegedly provided his wife and son with fake accounts statements claiming that they had purchased investments in the fund and were funding the investment. These statements also listed the name, symbol, current price per share and total value of each investment, which the complaint further alleges was so that he could partially repay the client in a Ponzi-like fashion. He also allegedly used some of these funds to cover his personal expenses, including car loans, mortgage insurance payments, his charitable foundation, school tuition, home renovations, chauffeuring, entertainment, travel, retail stores, sporting events and entertainment. Finally, contrary to what he told investors he would do with their money, however, Heckler continued to invest in this sham investment until at least January 2020 when he was barred by FINRA from associating with any broker-dealer with failing to respond to a complaint filed by a different investor.

According to the SEC's complaint, since at least 2015, Rand Heckler, a former broker who was barred by FINRA in 2019, solicited over $700,000 in investments from an elderly investor and the investor's son by claiming to manage a successful hedge fund through his company, Rand Heckler, Inc.Â  The complaint alleges that, in reality, Heckler and Rand Heckler, Inc. never managed a hedge fund and never invested the funds he received.Â  Instead, Heckler allegedly misappropriated most of these funds to pay for his personal expenses, including mortgage payments, car payments and a country club membership.Â  Further, Heckler allegedly sought to conceal his scheme by, among other things, sending allegedly phony account statements and trade confirmations to the investor and his son.  According to the complaint, when the investor's son sought to redeem part of his father's investments, Heckler solicited a new $100,000 investment from a different investor and persuaded the new investor to transfer the money to a bank account that she believed belonged to an investment firm, but in fact belonged to the first investor.

In a parallel action, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced criminal charges against Heckler.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, charges Heckler and Rand Heckler, Inc. with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8(a) thereunder.

Spyridon ""Sam"" Adondakis, Sandeep ""Sandy"" Goyal, Jon Horvath, Danny Todd Newman, Jesse Tortora, Diamondback Management, LLC, and Level Global Investors, L.P., Case Number 12-CV-1157 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES HEDGE FUND TRADERS IN $3.4 MILLION INSIDER TRADE  The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission today filed insider trading charges against three hedge fund traders who illegally traded in the securities of public companies Dell, Inc. and Nvidia Corp.  According to the Commission's complaint, during at least 2008, a Dell insider passed nonpublic information to a Hedge Fund analyst who then traded on the basis of the information he received from the insider. The insider then passed the inside information on to others, who reaped massive profits from trading on behalf of hedge funds managed by the fund manager. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges in connection with the same conduct.Â  The SEC alleges that during this time period, six individual defendants and two investment adviser firms traded Dell securities based on confidential information that the Dell Insider provided to him, reaping more than $4 million in ill-gotten gains. Among the defendants charged are:   San Francisco-based hedge Fund manager Adrod ""Adrod"" Tarasevich, former research analyst at Prudential Equity Group; (i) defendant Danny T. Newman (""Newman""); (ii) former investment advisory firm manager Kuo (""Kuo""); and (iii) a vice-president at Investment Adviser B (""Diamondback"").  In addition to using this information for his own benefit, Tarotevich also allegedly passed it to other individuals at other investment advisers with whom he regularly shared information, including Adrienne Newman (""Nano""), a former portfolio manager at Diamondbacks; and(iv) another individual who traded securities on his behalf. Through this conduct, investors profited approximately $2.5 million by trading in advance of Dell's quarterly earnings announcements, which were made public on May 7, 2009.&nbsp;  On May 11, 2010, for example, after receiving a tip from Taravevich","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 22230 / January 19, 2012  SEC v.

The charges stem from the SEC&#8217;s ongoing investigation into the trading activities of hedge funds.  The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the same seven individuals.  The SEC alleges that a network of closely associated hedge fund traders at Stamford, Conn.-based Diamondback Capital Management LLC and Greenwich, Conn.-based Level Global Investors LP illegally obtained the material nonpublic information about Dell and Nvidia.  Investment analyst Sandeep &#8220;Sandy&#8221; Goyal of Princeton, N.J., obtained Dell quarterly earnings information and other performance data from an insider at Dell in advance of earnings announcements in 2008.  Goyal tipped Diamondback analyst Jesse Tortora of Pembroke Pines, Fla., with the inside information, and Tortora in turn tipped several others, leading to insider trades on behalf of Diamondback and Level Global hedge funds.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, the illicit gains in the Dell insider trades exceeded $62.3 million, and the illicit gains in the Nvidia insider trades exceeded $15.7 million.  For his role in the scheme, Goyal was paid $175,000 in soft dollar payments that were deposited in a brokerage account of an individual affiliated with him.  The SEC alleges that after obtaining the inside information from Goyal in advance of Dell&#8217;s first and second quarter earnings announcements in 2008, Tortora tipped his portfolio manager at Diamondback, Todd Newman of Needham, Mass.  Newman traded on the information on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds he controlled.  Tortora also tipped Spyridon &#8220;Sam&#8221; Adondakis, an analyst at Level Global.  Adondakis tipped his manager Anthony Chiasson, who then traded on the inside information on behalf of Level Global hedge funds.  During this time period, both Adondakis and Chiasson lived in New York City.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Tortora also tipped two others at firms other than Diamondback or Level Global with the Dell inside information: Jon Horvath of New York City and Danny Kuo of San Marino, Calif.  Horvath caused insider trades at his firm that resulted in approximately $1.4 million of illicit gains.  Kuo similarly caused the firm where he worked to execute profitable insider trades in Dell securities.    The SEC further alleges that Kuo also obtained inside information about Nvidia Corporation&#8217;s calculation of its revenues, gross profit margins, and other financial metrics in advance of the company&#8217;s first quarter 2010 earnings announcements, which was made in May 2009.  Kuo again caused his firm to trade on inside information.  Kuo&#8217;s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $270,000 in ill-gotten gains.  Kuo also tipped Tortora at Diamondback and Adondakis at Level Global with the nonpublic information about Nvidia.  Tortora again tipped Newman, who made more insider trades on behalf of the Diamondback hedge funds.  The illegal trades in Dell and Nvidia securities resulted in $3.9 million in illicit gains for Diamondback.  At Level Global, Adondakis tipped Chiasson who made the insider trades on behalf of those hedge funds.  Chiasson&#8217;s insider trades in Dell and Nvidia resulted in approximately $72.6 million of illicit gains for the Level Global hedge funds.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, additionally, charges Goyal, Tortora, Newman, Adondakis, Chiasson, Horvath and Kuo with aiding and abetting others&#8217; violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering them to pay financial penalties, and permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws.

SEC CHARGES FOUR INDIVIDUALS IN $4.5 MILLION ACCOUNTING FRAUDULENT OFFERING OF INVESTOR FUNDS  The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Kennedale, Georgia-based broker-dealer Perkins Financial Instruments Inc., a Georgia corporation, and two of its principals.  According to the Commission's complaint, from September 2009 through the present, Perkins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, raised approximately $5 million from more than 20 investors through an unregistered offering of securities in connection with a purported ""overed call"" investment program. The complaint alleges that Perkins represented to investors that:  (1) investment returns were guaranteed to be 8%, 10% or 12% per annum depending on the investment; (2)Burnt would not be using any funds for his investors' personal and business expenses unless investors were earning their promised annualized returns; and (3)an undisclosed percentage of investor funds would becomeractually covered by an escrow account funded by Perkins.&nbsp;   Perkins and its subsidiaries also allegedly misrepresented that the covered call program would earn returns of between 8% and 12%, and that investors would be able to withdraw their money from their brokerage accounts at the minimum guaranteed amounts. In fact, the complaint further alleges, as a result of Perkins's misconduct, it has lost approximately 15 percent,primarily from investor withdrawals made from an account that was ""loaned"" to Perkins or other entities under Perkins' control, which, in turn, were ""covered call investments"" that were intended to generate returns in line with the promised returns. Further, to conceal the loss of cash from these investments, a portion of the withdrawal proceeds would have been used to pay personal expenses, such as personal loans, for a personal or business expense, or to cover the expenses of an individual or a business unit.

(âKSBâ), with violations of federal securities laws for making false and misleading statements in connection with an unregistered covered-call equities trading program.Â The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Burnt, through two entities which he controls, Perimeter Wealth and KSB, raised approximately $4.5 million from more than 20 investors.Â  Burnt represented to investors that: (1) investment returns were guaranteed to be between 8% to 12% per annum; (2) Burnt would not be paid any funds for his advisory services unless investors were earning 8% minimum annualized returns; and (3) any principal losses or shortfalls to the guaranteed returns would be contractually covered by a reserve account funded by defendants.Â  These representations were false in that Burnt failed to disclose to investors that he had begun directly drawing on investor funds prior to their earning the minimum guaranteed interest and that the purported reserve account was inadequately funded and incapable of covering the investor losses incurred.Â  Since its inception through November 30, 2010, the defendantsâ covered-call program has suffered net equalized losses of approximately 15%.Â In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that Burnt and Perimeter Wealth violated Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ).Â  The Complaint further alleges that KSB violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.Â On December 21, 2010 the Honorable William S.

209,"On September 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cambridge, Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with misleading investors about a key sales metric.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that during a series of public conference calls with investors in 2013 and 2014, defendants misrepresented to investors that the percentage of patients who ultimately purchased a drug known as Juxtapid, which is used to treat a rare and potentially life threatening genetic disease, was in the range of 50-60%.  According to the SEC, these numbers were misleading because, at the time of the alleged misrepresentations, only a small portion of prescriptions were converted into actual sales, and the vast majority were generated by new patients, many of whom had never used the drug before. The complaint further alleges the defendants failed to disclose the conversion rate to analysts and other analysts, even after they knew the numbers had not changed significantly over the course of a few years. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants have agreed to pay a total of $1.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 15(d)(1), 16(e)(3)(A), and 13(f), 13a-14, 13b2-1, 12b3-2, 15d-13, 16b1-11, 17d, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 30th and 31st of July, respectively.

Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, now a subsidiary of Novelion Therapeutics, has agreed to pay a $4.1 million penalty to settle the charges that it misled investors on multiple occasions in 2013.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Aegerion told investors that the number of unfilled prescriptions for Juxtapid was not material and the ""vast majority"" of patients receiving prescriptions went ahead and ultimately purchased the drug.  The SEC alleges that Aegerion's records reflect that it was actually around 50 percent of prescriptions that resulted in actual drug purchases.  According to the SEC's complaint, Juxtapid is used to treat a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that causes extremely high cholesterol.  In 2013 and 2014, it was priced at approximately $250,000 to $300,000 annually per patient.  Following Juxtapid's introduction in 2013, investors and investment analysts had little financial data to estimate Aegerion's future revenues from sales of the drug.  Aegerion allegedly provided details on the number of Juxtapid prescriptions during several subsequent earnings calls, but this data alone was insufficient for analysts and investors trying to forecast the company's future revenues because only prescriptions that were actually filled ""converted"" into sales.  According to the SEC's complaint, it wasn't until October 2014 that Aegerion disclosed to investors that the conversion rate was actually in the range of 50 to 60 percent.  But Aegerion allegedly failed to reveal to investors even then that the conversion rate had hovered around 50 percent since 2013.

The complaint further alleges thatSequential did not have adequate internal controls or other systems in place to ensure that appropriate goodwill impairment tests were conducted during interim periods between annual tests in accordance with applicable accounting principles.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Sequential failed to properly assess its goodwill for potential impairment after several months of declining stock prices followed by a precipitous drop in early November 2016.  According to the complaint, in December 2016, shortly after Sequential passed its annual goodwill testing, the company conducted internal calculations showing that, in light of the declining stock price, Sequential would fail the first step of its disclosed two-step impairment test.  The complaint alleges that the company ignored this objective evidence of impairment.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Sequential performed a qualitative analysis that omitted any mention of its internal calculations, as well as numerous other negative developments in the company's business, leading it to unreasonably conclude that goodwill was not impaired.  As alleged, by avoiding an impairment to its goodwill in 2016, Sequential inflated its income from operations, created a false impression of its financial condition, and misstated its financial statements and reports for almost a year.  Sequential allegedly continued to improperly account for goodwill in the next three quarters, before belatedly impairing all of its goodwill-totaling $304 million-in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Sequential with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and, additionally, charges Sequential with violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

SEC CHARGES INVESTMENT FIRM AND ITS RELIEF WITH FRAUDULENT OFFERING FEDERAL SERVICES SCHEME  The United States District Court for the District of Colorado announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the federal court in Denver, Colorado, charging a Colorado-based investment adviser and his friend with fraudulently raising more than $2 million from investors in a fraudulent offering of high yield promissory notes issued by CFS Holding Company LLC (CFS).  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least March through November 2009, the investment advisory firm and its affiliated broker-dealer, with the assistance of its principal, referred nine of the investors to a registered representative who referred them for undisclosed commissions. The complaint alleges that, contrary to his reputations as a successful financial services professional and a legitimate investor, and despite his assurances that the notes were ""secured"" and ""guaranteed,"" the investments were not safe, secured, or guaranteed and did not appear to have generated any legitimate business activity.  As a result of this conduct, investors were misled to believe that their money would be used to make interest payments back to them and to support Elrrod's personal expenses, including flights, hotels, restaurants, entertainment, clothing, flowers, jewelry and jewelry. In reality, as alleged, more money was being used for other purposes, such as to pay for travel and entertainment expenses that did, in fact, have not been disclosed to investors, to repay undisclosed legal fees and the NFA's enforcement action against the company, Elro and Pack failed to disclose material, non-public information concerning the use of investor funds and improper payments to certain investors. As further, according to one investor who was also referred to as ""Nova Dean"" Pack (""Pack"") was not registered to act as an associated person of a broker or dealer at the time the offering was offered and sold, but was required to do so because Pack had not participated in any true due diligence with respect to any investment. Pack also was never registered with a brokerage firm, nor was he associated with any registered broker dealer","On September 9, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Brian G. Elrod for allegedly conducting a fraudulent offering of promissory notes for which Nova Dean Pack acted as an unregistered broker.  Elrod and Pack reside in Buffalo Creek, Colorado and Highland, California, respectively.  The Complaint alleges that, from at least March 2009 through November 2009, Elrod and Pack raised approximately $2 million from 12 investors who invested in high-yield promissory notes issued by CFS Holding Company LLC (&#8220;CFS&#8221;), a Colorado company owned and managed by Elrod.  According to the Complaint, Elrod told investors that their investments were secured and guaranteed and would generate annual returns ranging from 12% to 24%.  According to the Complaint, Elrod further represented to investors that the proceeds from their promissory notes would be used to expand a group of financial services companies owned and managed by Elrod.  The Complaint alleges that the foregoing representations, among others, were false and misleading when made, and that Elrod, rather than use investor money for legitimate business purposes, improperly used most of the investor funds to make substantial payments to himself and family members and to pay for personal expenses, to pay Pack significant commissions for referring investors, and to make interest payments back to investors.  According to the Complaint, the CFS note offering was not registered with the Commission, and Pack was not an associated person of a registered broker or dealer at the time he participated in the CFS note offering.  Without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s allegations, Elrod and Pack agreed to settle the case against them.  The settlement is pending final approval by the court.

SHANE BASHIR SUMAN and MONIE RAHMAN, Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00342 (SAS) (SDNY)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Shane Bashir Suman and his wife, Monie Rahman, with insider trading in advance of the public announcement that Molecular Devices Corporation (MDS) would commence a cash tender offer for Molecular. The Commission's complaint alleges that, as an information technology specialist at MDS, he had access to a vast amount of confidential information concerning the impending transaction between Molecular and Molecular, which was to be announced at a public meeting on January 29, 2008. According to the complaint, from approximately December 2006 through January 2007, the defendants acquired a large number of critical e-mails related to an impending merger between the two companies. As a result of their illegal trading, Molecular's share price soared more than 46% to $35.07 and the trading volume spiked 50-fold. In a parallel action, on July 23, 2009, Judge Mascianica entered a final judgment against the Defendants that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 14e-3, and 17a-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant consented to entry of a judgment enjoining him from future violations of these charged provisions and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, plus prejudgment interest thereon, a $160,000 civil penalty, an officer-and-director bar and a one-year officer and director bar, for a period of five years. Rahman has agreed to settle the case by consenting to being permanently barred from the securities industry and associating with a penny stock company. She has also agreed not to participate in any offering of any securities other than those offered by Molecular or its parent company, S.C. (the ""Company""). The settlement is subject to court approval.) The settlements are pending approval by the court.

Shane Bashir Suman and Monie Rahman, No. 07-CV 6625 (J. Pauley) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC Charges Couple With Illegal Insider Trading in Securities of Molecular Devices Corp.    Washington, D.C., July 24, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against a former MDS Inc. employee who allegedly stole confidential information about MDS's impending tender offer for the shares of Molecular Devices Corp. (Molecular) and, along with his wife, used that information to trade in Molecular securities ahead of the merger's public announcement. The Ontario Securities Commission also brought its own separate enforcement action today to address this conduct.  The SEC alleges that Shane Bashir Suman, 34, of Toronto, learned about secret merger negotiations through access he had to electronic data in his job as an information technology specialist at MDS, then gave that information to his wife, Monie Rahman, 36. In the days before the tender offer became publicly known, Suman and Rahman made just over $1 million by trading in the securities of Molecular.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Suman's job gave him access to a vast amount of secret corporate information. In particular, Suman was able to read the contents of confidential e-mails and other electronic data without detection. For example, the circumstances in which Suman was called to restore an electronic document on Jan. 23, 2007, the day before he and his wife started trading, suggested the code name for the MDS-Molecular merger and the sensitivity associated with that project. Later that day, Suman conducted Internet searches for both that code name and for ""Molecular Devices"". Just after running those searches, Suman called Rahman and spoke to her for 100 minutes, much longer than their phone records indicate they usually spoke.  Between Jan. 24 and Jan. 26, 2007, Suman and Rahman bought 12,000 Molecular shares and 900 Molecular call options. Brokerage account records indicate that a portion of the Molecular securities purchases were financed with a margin loan of approximately $200,000, and the couple previously did not have a position in Molecular securities. On Jan. 29, 2007, MDS and Molecular jointly announced the tender offer for Molecular's shares. The stock price immediately rose from almost $24 to roughly $35, making Rahman and Suman's trades worth more than $1 million.  Suman and Rahman are both Canadian citizens, though Rahman has lived in Logan, Utah, since June 2006. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the OSC and the Chicago Board Options Exchange in this matter.

Huber and Hubadex, Inc., and Relief Defendants, Civil Action No.: 09-CV-06068 (N.D. Ill.)  SEC CHARGES INVESTMENT ADVISER AND HIS COMPANY FOR FRAUDULENTLY MISLEADING FEDERAL FUNDS  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Commission&#8212;) and the Investment Advisers &#151;Advisers Act (&#15220;Defendants&nbsp;), with conducting an ongoing fraudulent scheme that defrauded investors in the following funds: The Quadarter Fund, L.P., The SymmetryFund, LP, and The Trimester Fund.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least January 2006 through the present, William H.uber of Naples, Florida and his investment advisory firm,HubadeX, LLC, engaged in a $50,000 Ponzi-like scheme to defraud investors by misrepresenting the total assets held by each of the three funds and falsely claiming that they managed over $40 million in investor funds. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the funds only managed approximately $3 million. In order to conceal the fraud and conceal its ongoing, ongoing nature, HUBADEX has paid exorbitant fees to investors, including $1.2 million for the purchase and remodeling expenses of a residence in La Jolla, California and $2.5 million to a home in California. It is alleged that the defendants used funds to pay personal expenses to themselves and for other expenses, such as mortgage payments, home renovations, car payments and condominiums, travel, entertainment, jewelry, sporting events and other items that were not in accordance with the Fund's fiduciary duties. They also transferred investor money to other investors who were also in need of it and to repay the ill-gotten gains received from the fund. According the SEC's Complaint, beginning in January of 2006 and continuing until January 2007, Hubodex and its general partnership, The Quartet Funds, Ltd.

William A. Huber and Hubadex, Inc., Civil Action No. 09-CV-6068 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division  SEC SHUTS DOWN ILLINOIS MONEY MANAGER'S $40 MILLION FRAUDULENT SCHEME  On September 29, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a court order freezing assets and halting a scheme in which Decatur, Illinois-based money manager, William A. Huber, falsely portrayed himself to investors as a successful money manager who managed three private investment funds with assets over $40 million, consistently beating market indices through skillful trading and shrewd investments. In reality, he managed just $3 million in investor assets, frequently lost money on his trading and misappropriated investor funds to pay for his lavish bi-coastal lifestyle.  The SEC alleges that William A. Huber reported false account balances to investors in three investment funds he controlled, stating that the funds held more than $40 million as of August 31, 2009. Huber's funds, however, held little more than $3 million in assets as of that date. Huber lost money on his trading throughout 2009, yet told investors that his trading had generated substantial returns. Huber collected performance fees he did not earn based on his false claims of returns in the funds he managed. Huber made Ponzi-like payments to investors by using newer investor funds to make investor redemption payments at inflated amounts. Huber also diverted investor funds for his personal benefit, including purchasing expensive homes for himself in Naples, Florida and La Jolla, California. The SEC further alleges that shortly after the arrest of Bernard Madoff, in an effort to conceal his fraud from investors, Huber sent his investors an email reassuring them that he managed his funds honestly and that his funds bore no resemblance to Madoff's scheme. Similarly, the complaint alleges that Huber lied to SEC staff members during their investigation of his activities, reporting false account balances to the SEC and claiming hedge fund investments that did not exist.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, alleges that Huber solicited investments in three different private funds he controlled: The Quarter Funds, L.P., The Symmetry Fund, L.P. and The Trimester Fund. Huber managed the funds through Hubadex, Inc., a Decatur, Illinois-based company that he controlled.  The SEC's complaint charges Huber and Hubadex with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and the appointment of a receiver. The SEC's complaint also names Huber's wife, Ruthann Huber, and Huber's investment funds, The Quarter Funds, L.P., The Symmetry Fund, L.P. and the Trimester Fund, as relief defendants based on allegations that they received ill-gotten gains from Huber's fraud.  The Honorable Ruben Castillo, U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, granted the SEC's request for emergency relief, including an order permanently enjoining Huber and Hubadex from committing further violations of the antifraud provisions and an order freezing the assets of Huber, Hubadex and the relief defendants. Huber, Hubadex and the relief defendants agreed to the emergency relief requested by the SEC.

Brian Raymond Callahan, et al., Civil Action No.: 12-cv-1065 (E.D.N.Y.)  SEC Charges New York-Based Hedge Fund Manager with Defrauding Investors in $90 Million Ponzi Scheme  The Securities &amp; Exhange Co. filed a First Amended Complaint today in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of NY, alleging that investment adviser Brian R. ""Callahan,"" a resident of Old Westbury, New Yn. and the founder and a director of the investment advisory firms he controls, Horizon Global Advisors, LLC (HGA), HGA LLC, and Distinctive Investments, L.P. (collectively, the ""callahan funds"") engaged in a long-running fraudulent scheme in which investors were routinely misled about the nature of their investments and also were unaware of Defendants' frequent misuse and misappropriation of millions of dollars.  According to the Commission&#8217;s amended complaint, from at least 2005 to January 2012, callahan raised over $100 million from more than 45 investors for five offshore funds (Diversified Global Investments (BVI), L,P), The Masters Global Fund, LP, The Fiduciary Select Income Fund (Fi duciary), Horizon Millennium Investments and Pangea High Yield Portfolio, which were purportedly to invest in securities backed by real estate projects. The complaint also alleges that the defendants misrepresented to investors that their money would be pooled in one or more of these funds and to inflate the amount of assets under management, resulting in calls for a down payment on a multi-million dollar cooperative unit on Long Island. In fact, according to their initial complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan on May 29, Callahan diverted approximately $21.1 million of investor funds to his brother-in-law, Adam J. Manson, who also owns and operates a brokerage firm called Diversify Global and is also a relief defendant.

(ADS)   SEC CHARGES ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS FOR DEFRAUDING INVESTORS IN $90 MILLION PONZI SCHEME  On May 31, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint against New York investment adviser, Brian Raymond Callahan, and Callahan&#8217;s investment advisory firms, Horizon Global Advisors Ltd., and Horizon Global Advisors, LLC, in the SEC&#8217;s emergency action filed on March 5, 2012 that halted an ongoing $90 million Ponzi scheme.  The SEC&#8217;s amended complaint additionally charges Callahan&#8217;s five offshore funds with fraud and Callahan&#8217;s brother-in-law, Adam Judd Manson (&#8220;Manson&#8221;) and two of Manson&#8217;s entities, with aiding and abetting Callahan&#8217;s scheme.  The amended complaint also names Callahan&#8217;s wife, Sheri Manson Callahan, as a relief defendant.  Callahan&#8217;s five offshore funds have agreed to be placed under the control of the receiver that the Court appointed in an Order issued on March 27, 2012.   The SEC&#8217;s amended complaint includes the following allegations:    From at least 2005 to January 2012, Callahan raised over $90 million from at least 45 investors for his five offshore funds.  Callahan misused a portion of investor assets to pay certain other investors seeking redemptions, misused investor assets to pay for personal expenses for himself and his wife, and improperly diverted assets of the funds to Manson&#8217;s private real estate project on Long Island.&nbsp;  Manson and his entities, Distinctive Investments, LLC and Distinctive Ventures, LLC, created a paper trail of inflated false promissory notes and false audit confirmations that helped Callahan conceal the scheme.&nbsp;  Manson and his entities provided Callahan with unsecured promissory notes, which falsely stated they were payable on demand even though they were illiquid.  In addition, the face value of the promissory notes far exceeded the amount of money that Callahan provided to Manson&#8217;s real estate project.  Callahan used the false promissory notes to hide his misuse of fund assets and to inflate the amount of assets under management.&nbsp;  Manson and Distinctive Investments issued audit confirmations to the auditors of Callahan&#8217;s funds that misrepresented: (1) the outstanding principal balances on the promissory notes; and (2) that the promissory notes were callable.  By misleading the auditors, Manson helped hide the true financial condition of Callahan&#8217;s funds.    The SEC&#8217;s amended complaint charges Manson and his two entities with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.&nbsp; The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Manson and his entities.  The SEC charges Callahan&#8217;s five offshore funds with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder.&nbsp; The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against the funds.    The amended complaint also names Callahan&#8217;s wife, Sheri Callahan, who benefited from Callahan&#8217;s fraud, as a relief defendant.  For example, Sheri Callahan holds the title to Callahan&#8217;s primary residence.  The SEC alleges that Callahan made over $500,000 in mortgage payments on his primary residence with investor funds.  The SEC is seeking the return of Sheri Callahan&#8217;s ill-gotten gains, with interest.    The Court previously issued an Order on March 27, 2012 preliminarily enjoining Callahan and his advisory firms from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, continuing an asset freeze of Callahan&#8217;s and his advisory firms&#8217; assets, requiring Callahan and his advisory firms to repatriate assets, prohibiting Callahan and his advisory firms from soliciting or accepting any new investments, and appointing a receiver for the estates of Callahan&#8217;s advisory firms.

The compliant, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that a financial fraud took place at Team from approximately 1999 through 2001 and that there were two major components of the fraudulent scheme.  The first component involved improperly accounting for ""circular"" sales transactions between Team and certain other companies, including companies controlled by Cronin.  The second component of the scheme involved non-binding, ""minimum-guarantee"" distribution contracts.  Under these contracts, Team improperly recognized minimum-guaranteed revenue (specified in the terms of those contracts) even though the counter-parties were assured that the minimum-guarantee numbers would not be enforced.  In fact, in most or all cases, the minimum-guarantee contractual obligations were voided by undisclosed side-letter agreements. The complaint also alleges that the fraudulent scheme resulted in material misstatements and omissions in Team's periodic reports filed with the Commission and other public statements related to the company's fiscal years 1999 and 2000 (Team's fiscal year ended on 12/31).  For example, the circular and minimum-guarantee transactions caused Team to report in its filings with the Commission materially misstated revenue, income, and assets for the periods ended 12/31/1999, 3/31/2000, 6/30/2000 and 9/30/2000. The complaint further alleges that Levin, Team's former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, was the architect of the scheme and personally oversaw and directed its execution.  Levin's scheme was accomplished with the assistance of Cronin and Macchiarella.  During the relevant time period, Cronin was the head of Team's United Kingdom subsidiary, known as Team Dandelion.  Cronin and other companies in which he had an ownership interest were involved in the circular and minimum-guarantee transactions.  Macchiarella purportedly owned a film distribution company, which was not affiliated with Team and which entered into a guaranteed-minimum with Team.  Levin and Macchiarella made false statements to Team's auditors about Macchiarella's company and the contract.  In its administrative action against Clutten, the Commission alleges that Clutten was involved with the guaranteed-minimum contracts. Cronin has agreed to settle the Commission's action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a judgment (a) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and (b) prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Macciarella has agreed to settle the Commission's action, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, by consenting to the entry of a judgment (a) permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and13b2-2 thereunder, and (b) requiring him to pay disgorgement of $25,000 plus prejudgment interest and a $25, 000 civil penalty. Clutten has agreed to settle the Commission's administrative action by consenting to the entry of an order, without admitting or denying the findings in the order, directing him to cease and desist from (1) committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and (2) causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. The Commission will litigate the case against Levin.  The Commission's complaint alleges Levin violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Commission seeks an injunction against future violations of these provisions, an order prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, disgorgement of all unlawful gains and prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.

According to the Commission's complaint, Johnson concealed his illicit trading by using an online brokerage account that he used to trade prior to public public announcements, and by placing the orders for his illegal trades from his work computer. The complaint further alleges that Johnson used the account to purchase securities in at least nine public companies, shorting stocks on several occasions and establishing long positions in other instances, altogether reaping illegal profits in excess of $755,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, the complaint alleges:  Johnson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.&nbsp; The Commission seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar against Johnson; and Johnson consented to an order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, from trading on the basis of this material, non-public or confidential information in violation of Rule 102(e) of Regulation S.A. and Section 17(a)(1) and (2) promulgating or disseminating any negative information concerning a company's earnings release, including the anticipated announcement of a significant change in corporate leadership, earnings reports and forecast announcements; Johnson also agreed to be enjoined from future violations and to pay a penalty of approximately $100,00.

Donald L. Johnson, Defendant, and Dalila Lopez, Relief Defendant, Civil Action No. 11-CV-3618 (VM) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER NASDAQ MANAGING DIRECTOR WITH INSIDER TRADING  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action today in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Donald L. Johnson, a former managing director of The NASDAQ Stock Market, with multiple instances of insider trading.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Johnson held various positions at the NASD and NASDAQ for 20 years, until his retirement from NASDAQ in September 2009.  From at least January 2000 to October 2006, Johnson worked in NASDAQ&#8217;s Corporate Client Group (CCG).  He then transferred to the Market Intelligence Desk, a specialized department within the CCG that provides issuers with general market updates, overviews of their company&#8217;s sector, and commentary regarding the factors influencing day-to-day trading activity in their stocks.    The SEC alleges that, through his positions in the CCG and Market Intelligence Desk, Johnson had frequent and significant interactions with senior executives of NASDAQ-listed issuers, including CEOs, CFOs, and investor relations officers at his assigned companies.  In those interactions, company executives routinely shared confidential information with Johnson regarding impending public announcements that could affect the price of their stocks.  The executives who shared nonpublic information with Johnson did so based on the understanding that it would be kept confidential and that Johnson could not use the information for his personal benefit.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Johnson unlawfully traded in advance of nine announcements of material nonpublic information involving NASDAQ-listed companies from August 2006 to July 2009.  Johnson took advantage of both favorable and unfavorable information that was entrusted to him in confidence by NASDAQ and its listed companies, shorting stocks on several occasions and establishing long positions in other instances.  The complaint also states that Johnson often placed the trades directly from his work computer through an online brokerage account in his wife&#8217;s name.  The SEC alleges that Johnson reaped illicit profits in excess of $755,000 from his illegal trading.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Johnson with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of illicit profits with prejudgment interest and a monetary penalty.  Johnson&#8217;s wife Dalila Lopez is named as a relief defendant in the SEC&#8217;s complaint for the purpose of recovering illicit profits in her possession.    Johnson also has been charged in a parallel criminal action announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today.  The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s Criminal Division and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.  The SEC brought its enforcement action in coordination with these other members of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.  The SEC also acknowledges FINRA and NASDAQ for their assistance in this investigation.

219,"On November 22, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that defendant Imran Husain and his corporate attorney Gregg Evan Jaclin orchestrated a fraudulent ""shell factory"" scheme to create public shell companies, which had no assets or operations, and sell them to buyers who sought to trade the companies' stock publicly.  According to the SEC's original complaint, filed on November 23, 2014, Husains, a corporate lawyer based in Los Angeles, California, created and operated a shell company, PR Complete Holdings, Inc. (PR Complete), to sell to purchasers (the ""Shell Company Purchasers"").  The SEC alleges that the company was incorporated as a publicly-traded company by having it file a registration statement with the Commission to register the shares as publicly traded companies and then sell those shares to potential buyers, who would then be able to purchase the stock and trade their shares on the public markets at a lower cost. The complaint alleges the defendants violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as the reporting provisions, of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(d)(1).  Without admitting or denying the allegations, both defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions and ordering each to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, jointly and severally, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of each of them. In a parallel action filed in federal court in Santa Ana, Calif., the Honorable Robert A. Tercero, U.S. District Judge, issued a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of all defendants and imposing a civil penalty of $215,000, for a total of more than $1.5 million, against each defendant in connection with a related criminal action. Jacin has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against him from violating the anti-fraud, registration, reporting, books and records and penny stock bars provisions. He has also agreed not to violate the securities registration provisions under Section 13(e)(3) or (ii) under the control of any person or entity that he or she controls, including a company's director, to","A federal grand jury in San Francisco has indicted Gregg Jaclin, a New Jersey securities attorney, on charges relating to a scheme to manufacture public shell companies and sell them, including to some purchasers who used the shells for market manipulation schemes.  The 8-count indictment, returned May 18, 2017, also charges Jaclin with obstruction of justice of two SEC investigations.  Jaclin was charged in 2016 in a parallel SEC matter.  According to the indictment, Jaclin was an attorney specializing in penny stock companies.  He worked with another individual-an undisclosed control person-to incorporate ten new companies, take them public, help get regulatory clearance to enable public trading of their stock, and sell them.  Eight companies were sold for a total of approximately $2.25 million.  Two companies were the subject of SEC enforcement actions before they could be sold.  (see Stop Orders 33-9444 (Aug. 22, 2013) and 33-9577 (April 23, 2014)).  According to the indictment, for each company and with Jaclin's knowledge or at his suggestion or direction, the control person hired a CEO and created a business plan to give the impression of a real company poised for growth.  In fact, each CEO took all direction from the control person, and the true plan was to sell the company.  Jaclin and those working at his direction, however, prepared numerous false and misleading documents that hid the control person and the actual business plan:  registration statements to take the companies public; quarterly and annual reports; and attorney opinion letters.  Jaclin also facilitated the sale of the shell companies by locating some of the purchasers and documenting all of the transactions.  The criminal case against Jaclin is based on much of the same conduct alleged in an amended SEC complaint, which was filed on November 22, 2016.  The SEC's complaint alleged that Jaclin and his co-defendant, undisclosed control person Imran Husain, engaged in a ""shell factory"" scheme to create and sell public companies at a profit.  The SEC's amended complaint charged:  (i) Husain with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and, in the alternative, as a control person, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) Jaclin with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; (iii) Husain and Jaclin, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting violations of Section 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (iv) Husain and Jaclin with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, and 15d-13 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Central District of California, alleges that Edward Chen, a resident of Arcadia, Calif., and wife Jean Chen raised at least $22.515 million from 45 investors in connection with the sale of limited partnership interests in a Los Angeles-area real estate development project that was supposed to be developed by a Chinese company. The complaint further alleges the defendants diverted millions of dollars in investor money to fund the purchase of non-existent office space in an Ontario, California condominium building, and then transferred the money back to Chen-controlled entities. According to the SEC, these misappropriations totaled approximately $9.5 million.

On September 20, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against Edward and Jean Chen, Home Paradise Investment Center LLC, GH Investment LP, GH Design Group LLC, Golden Galaxy LP, and Mega Home LLC, alleging that the Chens, through the entities they controlled, raised more than $22.5 million from 45 investors in China for the development of an interior design center and an 80-unit condominium building.  The complaint alleged that the Chens misappropriated and misused more than $12 million of investors' funds by purchasing residential real estate unrelated to the two EB-5 projects.  The SEC's complaint further alleged that the Chens and their companies provided investors a fake lease for the interior design center that replaced the name of the true lessor with a Chen-controlled entity and overstated the true size of the leased space five-fold.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments resolving all claims.  The final judgments enjoin defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and further enjoin Edward and Jean Chen from participating in the offer or sale of any security which constitutes an investment in a ""commercial enterprise"" under the USCIS EB-5 visa program.

Whitney, David Lee Parrish, The Church For the Healthy Self, a/k/a CHS Trust, and a related entity they control, for running a $25 million Ponzi scheme targeting the Vietnamese community of Orange County, California.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from May 2008 through April 2010, Whitney and Parish engaged in a scheme to avoid posting more than $96 million of margin calls when placing orders for commodity options traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. According to the complaint, they told investors that their funds would be invested in insurance, reinsurance, or other types of investments that would provide ""safe and secure growth"" without exposing the investors' money to market declines. The complaint further alleges, however, that the defendants did not invest the money or donate to charity, but instead used it to pay personal expenses, pay credit card bills, student loans, rent and rent, to satisfy liquidation requests with recent deposits of new investors. In addition to paying the promised returns to investors through insurance and other investment products, investors are able to withdraw money from their account and use it for purposes unrelated to their particular investment. As alleged, in one instance, when investors sought to liquidate their savings, their money was diverted to uses inconsistent with investment activities such as paying for cars and vacations, as well as to make payments to earlier investors, including liquidating their investments without investing the funds as required by the federal securities laws. On March 4, 2018, after the SEC sought and obtained a criminal seizure of funds in connection with the scheme, it was discovered that Whitney had misappropriated at least $6.3 million in investor funds, which he used to support his lifestyle and for his personal and business expenses. Through this conduct, he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the SEC, the Church for the Healthy Self's investment program, CHS Trust, promised investors tax-deductible, guaranteed, and insured returns of at least 12%, through reinsurance investments and options trading.  David Lee Parrish, who assisted Whitney's earlier fraud, joined his friend as a co-pastor of The Church for the Healthy Self and as the purported director of CHS Trust.  Whitney and Parrish primarily targeted Vietnamese investors through extensive radio and television advertisements touting CHS Trust.  Instead of generating the promised guaranteed profits, Whitney and Parrish stole millions of dollars of investor funds and paid returns through Ponzi payments.

SEC SUES THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS LLC FOR RESEARCH ANALYST CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  FIRM TO PAY $12.5 MILLION TO SETTLE WITH SEC, NASD, NYSE, AND STATE REGULATORS  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has settled charges against Thomas Weisel Partners LLC, a San Francisco, California-based brokerage firm and investment bank, arising from an investigation of research analyst conflicts of interest.  This settlement is related to the global settlement that ten other firms reached with the Commission, NASD, Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (""NYSE""), and state regulators in April 2003.  In connection with this matter, the Commission today filed a Complaint against Thomas Weisel Partners in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of the federal securities laws and NASD and NYSE rules.  In the SEC action, Thomas Weisel Partners has agreed to a federal court order that will enjoin the firm from future violations of the federal securities laws and NASD and NYSE rules and require the firm to make changes in the operations of its equity research and investment banking departments.  As part of the settlement, Thomas Weisel Partners has agreed to pay $5 million as disgorgement and an additional $5 million in penalties.  One-half of the $10 million total of these payments - $5 million - will be paid in connection with the SEC action and related proceedings by the NASD and NYSE and will be placed into a distribution fund for the benefit of customers of the firm.  The remainder will be paid to resolve related proceedings by state regulators.  In addition, Thomas Weisel Partners will pay, over five years, $2.5 million to provide the firm's clients with independent research.  According to the Commission's Complaint, from July 1999 through 2001, research analysts at Thomas Weisel Partners were subject to inappropriate influence by investment banking at the firm.  The Complaint also alleges that, on several occasions, Thomas Weisel Partners's analysts published research that contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims, and/or opinions for which there was no reasonable basis, and that Thomas Weisel Partners received payment from another investment bank for providing research coverage of that firm's investment banking client without disclosing that payment in research reports, as federal law requires.  Further, the Complaint alleges that Thomas Weisel Partners made payments to other firms for those firms to publish research on Thomas Weisel Partners's underwriting clients without ensuring that such payments were disclosed.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that Thomas Weisel Partners failed to supervise its research analysts adequately and to establish policies to ensure their proper conduct.   Specifically, the Commission's Complaint alleges that:   Thomas Weisel Partners engaged in acts and practices that created and maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts.  Thomas Weisel Partners analysts worked as a team with the firm's investment bankers and were deeply involved in the firm's efforts to pitch and win investment banking business.  Firm analysts also participated in pitches for investment banking business and prepared portions of pitchbooks used in such solicitations.  Some pitchbooks contained information that implied to issuers that Thomas Weisel Partners would provide positive research coverage if selected for an investment banking transaction, and that such coverage could result in rising stock prices for those companies.  The firm's investment bankers also evaluated the firm's research analysts and those performance evaluations were considered in setting the analysts' compensation.   In certain instances, Thomas Weisel Partners issued research reports that contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims and/or opinions for which there was no reasonable basis.  For example, the Thomas Weisel Partners analyst covering InfoSpace, Inc. maintained a buy rating on the stock in January through July 2001, while, during the same time period, privately telling colleagues in e-mails, among other things, that InfoSpace is ""dead $"" and ""I can't  . . . believe that I still have [InfoSpace] as a buy rating.  I need a drink.""   In another instance, while Thomas Weisel Partners had a ""buy"" rating as to Level3 Communications, Inc. in May and June 2001, the analyst covering Level3 admitted in an e-mail that the stock was not ""a buy,"" and explained that he was waiting to downgrade the stock until after a Thomas Weisel Partners-sponsored business conference because, ""If I downgrade right now they will assuredly pull from our conference and we can't afford that.""  In a subsequent email, the analyst stated that, despite the ""buy"" rating, ""I've basically been telling our clients that it is a great short.""    Thomas Weisel Partners failed to disclose that it was paid $40,000 by another investment bank in part for providing research coverage of Hotjobs.com, Inc.  Thomas Weisel Partners also paid a total of $375,000 to other brokerage firms to initiate or continue research coverage on issuers for whose securities offerings Thomas Weisel Partners served as lead underwriter or co-manager, including Arena Pharmaceuticals and Proxicom, Inc.  Thomas Weisel Partners did not ensure that these payments were disclosed.  Thomas Weisel Partners's management failed to adequately monitor the activities of the firm's research and investment banking professionals to ensure compliance with NASD and NYSE rules and the federal securities laws.

Patel, et al., United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Civil Action No 2:04-CV-4949 (D.N.H. filed Sept. 19, 2005)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in the U. S. District court, Eastern Division. Enterasys Networks, Inc. and its former parent company, Cabletron Systems Inc., agreed to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges against them. The Commission alleges that the defendants engaged in a company-wide scheme to artificially inflate the revenues of the company by artificially inflating revenues through transactions that lacked one or more necessary elements for revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations, have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), (3), and (4) and of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of those provisions. In addition, each defendant agreed, with respect to a written consent, to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and a five year officer and director bar for a period of ten years. According to these settlements, the Defendants knowingly negotiated, reviewed and otherwise participated in numerous transactions for which revenue was improperly recognized. These transactions included undisclosed ""side agreements"" with purchasers, in which payment for product was contingent upon the purchaser's resale of product (i.e., sell through payment terms), or payment of full return, exchange, or cancellation rights. Additionally, these transactions were linked to investments in unprofitable, privately-held companies in exchange for an investee company's agreement to use the investment proceeds to buy products from Enterays and Aprisma.

On February 9, 2007 the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud action against ten former officers and employees of Enterasys Networks, Inc.  According to the Commission's complaint, from March 2000 through December 2001, the former officers and employees directly participated in a company-wide scheme to fraudulently inflate revenues at Enterasys and its former parent company, Cabletron Systems, Inc. and thereby convince the market that Enterasys was a viable independent company with consistently strong revenue growth.  The defendants named in the complaint are:  Robert Barber, Hor Chong (David) Boey, Lawrence Collins, Robert Gagalis, Eric Jaeger, Bruce Kay, David Kirkpatrick, Piyush Patel, Jerry Shanahan, and Michael Skubisz.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District of New Hampshire, the defendants participated in improperly recognizing revenue from numerous sales transactions, many of which involved undisclosed side agreements in which the purchaser was granted full return or exchange rights, or payment for the product was contingent upon the purchaser's resale of the product or a future investment by Enterasys.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants misrepresented information to, or concealed information from, the company's outside auditor.  Based on the foregoing, the Complaint alleges that the defendants violated or aided and abetted the violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a),  13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The Complaint also alleges that defendants Collins, Gagalis, Kay, Kirkpatrick, Patel, and Skubisz aided and abetted the violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil money penalties against each defendant, and officer and director bars against defendants Boey, Gagalis, Jaeger, Kay, Kirkpatrick, Patel, Shanahan, and Skubisz.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Kevin ""Heron,"" the former general counsel, corporate secretary, and chief insider trading compliance officer for Amkor Technology, Inc.   In its complaint, the Commission alleges that from October 2003 through June 2004, Sheon engaged in a pattern of trading by purchasing and/or selling securities prior to five public announcements relating to earnings results and company business transactions. During this period, her trading consisted of more than $100,000 in illegal profits and losses avoided. According to the complaint:  During the blackout periods, when the company's public disclosure of negative financial results was not announced, she and other employees were subject to company blackout period periods that prohibited trading in her position as the General Counsel. As a result of her illegal trading, Myon benefited from approximately $290,500 in profits avoided from his trading.&nbsp; The complaint further alleges: On the morning of April 15, 2004 and the afternoon of June 23, 2003, a day before the public announcement of positive results for both the first quarter and second quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, Herone sold 5,200 shares and purchased 20 call option contracts. The next day, on the day after the press release was released, Heon sold 2,100 shares of Amekor stock.

Heron of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, the former general counsel, corporate secretary, and chief insider trading compliance officer of Amkor Technology, Inc. The Commission's complaint alleges that from October 2003 through June 2004, Heron engaged in a pattern of insider trading by trading in Amkor securities prior to five Amkor public announcements relating to financial results and company business transactions. During this period, Heron executed more than fifty illegal trades in Amkor stock and options on the basis of material, nonpublic information that Heron had learned as a result of his position as general counsel. Heron executed nearly all of these illegal trades while he and other company employees were subject to company blackout periods that prohibited them from trading in Amkor stock. Even though Heron was the person at Amkor who was responsible for administering these blackout periods, Heron routinely violated Amkor's blackout periods by trading on inside information. Heron's trading yielded profits, and losses avoided, totalling approximately $290,000. Heron was terminated from his positions at Amkor in September 2005.  Heron is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, which are the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and money penalties against Heron, as well as an order prohibiting Heron from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

The complaint alleges that, in reality, the purported investment did not exist. Instead, as alleged,Matthes used the majority of the misappropriated funds for personal expenses, including his credit card payments, mortgage payments and car payments. He also made Ponzi-like payments to certain investors to keep his fraudulent scheme alive.

In addition to stealing the customers' money and depositing it into the bank accounts of other customers, he allegedly used more than $170,000 of investor funds to repay earlier investors, and pay other expenses to himself and his family members.

WITH VIOLATIONS OF THE SECOND CHARGED OFFERING OF $10 MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY  On June 15, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States district court in Los Angeles, charging a California-based venture capital fund and its principals with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the unregistered and fraudulent sale of securities. The complaint alleges that from approximately July 25, 2007 through at least November 2009, U.A.Ventures raised $11.5 million from more than 100 investors in multiple states through the fraudulent sales of ""convertible bonds."" The bonds represent that investors can either collect monthly interest payments of up to 25 percent and provide a 10 percent up-front ""interest bonus"" such that someone who invests $100,000 in a UAV bond purportedly would receive interest on a principal amount of $1 million. According to the complaint, these investments are not ""guaranteed"" because they do not have sufficient assets to cover its obligations to bondholders. In fact, according to UA's website and brochures, many investors invested only a small fraction of their initial investment with an investment by Integra, but the vast majority of those investments resulted in annualized returns of 12 percent or more. As a result of these aggressive sales practices, investors were left with little or no recourse to return their investment to their investors.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, alleges that between July 2007 and November 2009, UAV, based in Irvine, California, and its principals, Thomas and Hollowell, along with its investor relations associate, Dies, sold approximately $10 million in bonds to approximately 100 individual investors in various states. Integra, formerly of Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was owned and controlled by Oliva, used a website and held investment seminars to solicit investors for UAV.The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed numerous material facts in communications with investors. They assured investors, for example, that UAV had a strong track record of profiting from medical-related investments and that investors would earn a guaranteed 25 percent annual return on UAV's bonds. In reality, UAV had no such record or experience, and never earned a return from any investment. Instead, UAV used nearly all of the money it raised from investors for purposes other than investments in medical ventures, such as paying exorbitant salaries and benefits to Thomas and Hollowell, paying referral fees to Integra and Oliva, and making Ponzi-type interest payments to investors. Further, the defendants misrepresented Thomas' venture capital experience and educational background, and failed to inform investors that Thomas was previously barred by a California court from being involved in any securities offering.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, the defendants each consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Spradling, a penny stock promoter who distributed newsletters under various titles including ""Market News Alert.""  The Complaint alleges that, through his newsletters and websites, Spradling illegally touted stocks without adequately disclosing the amount and nature of his compensation.  In fact, Spradling's compensation most often came from the very companies he promoted or persons associated with the companies that he promoted.  The Complaint also alleges that Spradling ""scalped"" stocks he promoted by selling into the demand that his newsletters and website promotions created.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that between April 2001 and September 2003, Spradling promoted more than 44 penny stock issues by faxing newsletters to hundreds of thousands of individuals.  The Complaint further alleges that Spradling received compensation in the form of stock for at least 36 of the penny stocks he promoted and that he sold at least 32 of the stocks during the promotion of the stock.  By his conduct, Spradling yielded net proceeds of over $1.6 million.   The Complaint also alleges that Spradling falsely stated that ""Market News Alert is an independent research firm with paid subscribers.""  In fact, the production and dissemination of each newsletter was paid for by the subject company or a related promoter and Spradling's newsletter had no paid subscribers.  The Complaint also alleges that Spradling disseminated fraudulent annual revenues and revenue forecasts on behalf of at least one company.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, in May 2002, Spradling wrote and disseminated a promotion of THC Communications (""THCR"") in his Market News Alert newsletter.  Prior to disseminating the newsletter, Spradling met with the officers of THCR, obtained a copy of THCR's business plan, and its 2001 financial statements filed with the Commission.  THCR's 2001 financial statements reflected $739,065 of audited revenues and its business plan projected 2002 revenues of $12 million.  The Complaint further alleges that Spradling's May 2002 newsletter listed THCR's audited 2001 revenues as $11.1 million, which was fifteen times greater than THCR's actual 2001 audited revenues filed with the Commission.  The newsletter also listed THCR's projected 2002 revenue as $25 million, which was twice the amount projected in the company's business plan given to Spradling.  The Complaint alleges that in exchange for the promotion, Spradling received compensation of approximately $400,000 from the company and individuals whom Spradling knew were the CEO and CFO of the company.   The Complaint seeks to permanently enjoin Spradling from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the anti-touting provision of the Securities Act of 1933, specifically Section 17(b).

SEC FILES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST NEUROTECH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND ITS FATHER-SON MANAGEMENT TEAM  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud action today against Neurotech Development Corporation, a Roslyn, New York-based corporation, and its father-son management team, Bernard Artz and Lawrence Artz, concerning false and misleading statements in its Commission filings and press releases.  Neurotech is purportedly in the business of marketing rapid deployment healthcare systems, including prefabricated hospitals, in developing countries.   The Commission=s Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, during the period from at least May 1999 through January 2003, Neurotech, acting through its officers, Bernard Artz and his son Lawrence Artz, violated the federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements in its Commission filings and press releases concerning its purported receipt of millions of dollars in Indonesian ""bank guarantees"" and billions of dollars in construction contracts.  The statements concerning the ""bank guarantees"" were false and misleading because the purported instruments were, in fact, fraudulent.  In addition, the statements concerning the construction contracts were false and misleading because the vast majority of the contracts were unenforceable.  In fact, Neurotech received only $5.5 million in revenue from the $3.7 billion in construction contracts it claimed to have signed during the relevant period.  The statements concerning the construction contracts were false and misleading because, taken both individually and collectively, they falsely suggested that Neurotech was an active, viable company with an imminent revenue stream.  Bernard Artz, the company's chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer signed and certified Neurotech's Commission filings and reviewed the company's press releases.  Lawrence Artz, the company's vice president, also signed the Commission filings and prepared the press releases. The Complaint alleges that Neurotech and Bernard and Lawrence Artz violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (antifraud provisions) and that Neurotech violated, and that the Artzes aided and abetted its violations of, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder (reporting provisions).

229,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tom Simeo, the former CFO of Viking Energy Group, Inc., a publicly-traded oil and gas company, with making false and misleading statements in Viking's periodic reports.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Viking filed false filings with the SEC that falsely represented that the company's purported Chief Financial Officer, Guangfang ""Cecile"" Yang, had performed an ""internal control over financial reporting"" process, and that Yang had participated in audits of specific initial public offerings while at that audit firm. The complaint also alleged that, contrary to these representations, Yang did not perform any functions as the CompanyâsÂ CFO and was effectively operating without one. According to the complaint, in order to give the false appearance of an actual audit being performed, Viking falsely required Yang to sign a signature that he or she signed. In addition, as a result of the filing of these false statements and other misleading information, V. Viking failed to disclose Yang as its purported chief financial officer in its annual and quarterly reports, which were filed in violation of Sarbanes-Oxley Act Rule 13a-14. Additionally, no independent investigation was conducted by the Commission, including an accounting firm that was not involved in the investigation. Finally, on September 17, 2019, a federal court in Brooklyn, New York entered a final judgment against Viking, permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering it to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and disgorgement of $1,038.50, plus prejudgment interest thereon and a civil money penalty therefrom.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, all parties agreed to be enjoined from future violations of those provisions and any other federal securities laws.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against Tom Simeo, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Viking Energy Group, Inc., for making materially misleading disclosures in Viking's publicly filed reports regarding Viking's purported Chief Financial Officer.  The SEC alleges that Tom Simeo, a resident of New York City, New York, created the false impression to the public that Viking had an experienced financial professional involved in its operations and financial reporting as its CFO, when in reality, the Company had no CFO.  According to the complaint, between November 2014 and May 2016, Viking's public filings falsely disclosed that Guangfang ""Cecile"" Yang was Viking's CFO.  In addition, as alleged, certain SOX certifications accompanying these filings falsely represented that Yang, as Viking's CFO, had performed an evaluation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and reviewed Viking's annual and quarterly reports.  The SEC alleges that Simeo created the false appearance that Yang served as CFO by repeatedly affixing Yang's signature to Viking's periodic reports and SOX certifications.  The SEC alleges that, aside from Yang's purported signatures on Viking's filings, there is no evidence that Yang functioned as the Company's CFO from at least November 2014 through Yang's purported resignation in July 2016.  The SEC previously filed a subpoena enforcement action against Simeo, compelling him to testify and produce, among other things, communications relating to Yang.  The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered an order on January 30, 2018, directing Simeo to comply with subpoenas issued to him by SEC staff in connection with its investigation.  The SEC's complaint charges Simeo with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a penny stock bar, and a civil monetary penalty. The SEC also seeks an order barring Simeo from serving as an officer and director of a public company.

230,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Chicago-area immigration attorney with defrauding at least 226 immigrant investors, most of whom are citizens of China or Iran.  According to the SEC's complaint, Seyed Taher Kameli, who lives in Chicago, raised approximately $88.7 million from more than 200 investors through the EB-5 immigrant investment program, which provides a path to permanent U.S. residency for foreign nationals seeking permanent residency. The complaint alleges that, in exchange for a $500,000 capital contribution, he promised investors that they could purchase one unit of a particular Fund and become a member of that Fund. He told investors the Fund would then use their funds to loan money to a specific Project, eventually resulting in an operational, revenue-producing, and job-creating senior living facility for the investors. In reality, as alleged, the funds did not have enough money or the requisite number of jobs per investor to qualify them for permanent US residency under the program. To make matters worse, Kamel allegedly diverted investor funds for his own benefit and to benefit himself and his companies, including his brother, Bright Oaks Group, Inc., a Florida corporation that he owns and which is located in Aurora, Illinois. As a result of his misconduct, investors lost over $1 million in investor proceeds. Kamali has used a significant amount of investor money for personal expenses, trading securities with money lent by the Funds to other entities he controls, or to fund his business ventures, such as a condominiums, assisted living facilities, retirement homes, retail real estate development businesses, hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, sports arenas, sporting events, music, movie theaters, casinos, golf courses, fitness centers, jewelry stores, luxury cars, home furnishings, office furniture, designer clothing, a car, an apartment building, construction materials, travel and entertainment services, his wife and children, business associates, personal travel expenses and the purchase and sale of luxury automobiles and luxury vehicles, according to court papers filed in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois on June 22, 2017. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint's allegations, defendants have consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) as well as the securities laws of those states and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(e) of The Securities Exchange","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Chicago-based immigration attorney with defrauding investors participating in the EB-5 immigrant investor program by improperly commingling and misusing a portion of the approximately $88.7 million raised.  The SEC alleges that Seyed Taher Kameli and his companies, Chicagoland Foreign Investment Group, LLC and American Enterprise Pioneers, Inc., falsely claimed to at least 226 foreign investors that each of their $500,000 investments would be used to help construct a specific senior living project in the Chicago area or Florida and create at least 10 permanent full-time jobs within that project. This would qualify each investor for a potential path to permanent U.S. residency through the EB-5 program.  According to the SEC's complaint, rather than use investor funds solely for the senior living project for which an investor was solicited, Kameli diverted millions of dollars to fund other projects and to make unrelated payments, which was contrary to representations to investors and the requirements of the EB-5 Program. Kameli also spent a significant portion of investor proceeds for his own benefit, for his brother's benefit, and for the benefit of companies he owns.

The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 and aided and abetted by the Commission's independent auditor, outside counsel and Canadian regulators. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from future violations of these provisions and ordering each to pay disgorgement of $1,092,906, plus prejudgment interest of a total $7,829, which is equal to their respective civil penalties. In addition, each defendant has agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company or by association with a registered broker-dealer or investment adviser.

Research in Motion Limited, Dennis Kavelman, Arcangelo Loberto, James Balsillie and Mihal Lazaridis, 1:09-cv-00301 (RBW) (D.D.C.)  SEC CHARGES RESEARCH IN MOTION AND FOUR OF ITS SENIOR EXECUTIVES WITH STOCK OPTION BACKDATING  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ontario, Canada, BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Limited (RIM) and four of its senior executives with stock option backdating.  The SEC's complaint alleges that RIM, its former Chief Financial Officer Dennis Kavelman, former Vice President of Finance Angelo Loberto, and Co-Chief Executive Officers James Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis illegally granted undisclosed, in-the-money options to RIM executives and employees by backdating millions of stock options over an eight-year period from 1998 through 2006. The complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading disclosures about how RIM priced and accounted for options, and that the illicit backdating provided the executives and other employees with millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation. In addition, according to the complaint, the backdating violated the terms of RIM's stock option plan and a listing requirement of the Toronto Stock Exchange. RIM's stock is listed on both the NASDAQ Stock Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange.  As alleged in the complaint, Kavelman, Loberto, Balsillie and Lazaridis backdated option agreements and offer letters, which concealed the fact that the options were granted in-the-money. The complaint also alleges that Kavelman and Loberto took steps to hide the backdating from regulators, RIM's independent auditor and outside lawyer. The complaint further alleges that after all four executives were aware of backdating issues that had come to light at other companies, they attended RIM's July 2006 annual shareholder meeting where Kavelman misled investors by denying that RIM was backdating options.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, contains the following additional allegations:   From 1998 through 2006, RIM, Kavelman, Loberto, Balsillie and Lazaridis backdated approximately 1,400 stock option grants for a total of nearly seven million shares, including new hire, group, promotional and periodic grants.  Balsillie initially ran RIM's stock option program and directed others to backdate his own and other employees' options. Kavelman assumed increasing responsibility for the option program and approved backdating many grants. Loberto helped carry out the backdating and selected prior dates with low prices for a number of grants. Lazaridis requested that options for certain new hires and employees be backdated.  At times, when RIM's stock price dropped after employees had received options, the four executives re-priced the same options at substantially lower backdated prices.  To one new hire, Kavelman expressed a concern about an ""optics issue"" with the regulators if the new hire's start date did not match the grant date for his options. Nevertheless, Kavelman and Balsillie agreed to backdate the options to the lowest price before the new hire's start date.  Kavelman and Loberto usually picked low strike prices within reporting periods and in some instances avoided the lowest price so regulators would not detect the backdating. In addition, Kavelman asked a manager not to document improper pricing in e-mails. Kavelman wrote, ""FYI, it is a major breach of protocol to be discussing (and documenting via email) using option pricing other than that allowable by the Ontario Securities Commission and the SEC in the US.""  Kavelman and Loberto received numerous documents from RIM's outside lawyer, RIM's auditor, the securities industry and RIM's own finance department explaining the accounting for options and options pricing, but they ignored all of the information and advice they received.  The defendants' misconduct caused RIM, from fiscal year 1999 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2007: (i) to falsely disclose in its annual and other reports, management information circulars and registration statements that RIM's options were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of RIM's common stock at the date of the grants; and (ii) to file materially false and misleading financial statements that understated RIM's compensation expenses and overstated its quarterly and annual net income or understated its net losses.   All defendants have agreed to settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, on the following terms:  RIM consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16. The settlement with RIM takes into account RIM's cooperation during the SEC's investigation.  Kavelman and Loberto consented to an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, the internal controls and books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, the misrepresentations to auditors provision of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; and from aiding and abetting RIM's violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions. Kavelman also consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating the certification provision of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Kavelman and Loberto agreed to be barred for a period of five years from serving as officers or directors of any issuer that has a class of securities registered with the SEC or that is required to file reports with the SEC. In addition, Kavelman and Loberto agreed to resolve an anticipated administrative proceeding by consenting to an SEC order prohibiting them from appearing or practicing before the SEC as accountants for five years.  Balsillie and Lazaridis consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and the internal controls and books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1; and from aiding and abetting RIM's violations of the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions.  The individual defendants will pay civil penalties in the following amounts: $500,000 for Kavelman; $425,000 for Loberto; $350,000 for Balsillie; and $150,000 for Lazaridis. The individual defendants also agreed to disgorge the in-the-money value of backdated options they had exercised ($132,914.60 for Kavelman, $47,950.56 for Loberto, $334,250 for Balsillie and $328,300 for Lazaridis) plus interest. Their disgorgement will be deemed satisfied by their previous payment of these amounts to RIM.  The settlements in the civil injunctive action are subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  On February 5, 2009, the Ontario Securities Commission brought a related settled action against RIM, Balsillie, Lazaridis, Kavelman, Loberto and certain other directors which included the total payment in Canadian dollars of $76.85 million and other sanctions.

The SEC alleges that, since at least 2014, Nicholas Joseph Genovese and his hedge fund Willow Creek Investments LP raised more than $5.3 million from at least six investors by affirmatively misrepresenting his prior money-management, securities industry experience, and size of operations.Â In particular, the SEC charged that Genovese:Â falsely stated that he managed $4 billion of the Genovese Drug Store family's assets; falsely stated that his hedge fund's investment adviser had $30-39 billion of assets under management, when, in reality, it appears to have had less than $10 million in assets under management; falsely stated that his advisory firm had between 42 and 60 employees, when, in reality, it had less than 10 employees; andÂ falsely stated that his hedge fund had investment gains of 30-40 percentÂ per year, when, in reality, it sustained losses.Â In addition, in furtherance of his scheme, Genovese lied about his education and prior work experience, and concealed his criminal past from investors.  The SEC also alleges that Genovese and his advisory firm Willow Creek Advisors LLC misappropriated investor funds to fund securities trading in Genovese's personal brokerage account, which sustained over $8 million of trading losses between 2015 and 2017, and Genovese's lifestyle by paying approximately $263,000 for, among other things, ATM cash withdrawals, food, hotel and transportation charges, including being chauffeured in a Bentley. According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Genovese's fraud appears to be ongoing evidence by recent money coming into his account as well as a recent refusal of an investor's redemption request.

With Fraudulent Offering Scheme   The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against three individuals and their companies.  According to the Commission's complaint, the Downeys, through Quest, used a fraudulent private placement memorandum (PPM) to raise at least $4.8 million from 17 investors through fraudulent offers and sales of interests in a limited partnership called Permian Advanced Oil Recovery Investment Fund I, LP (PAOR). The PPM contained lies and materially misleading omissions about: (i) Quest's financial health and viability; (ii) the debt and liens associated with certain oil and gas leases in which PAOR was purportedly acquiring an interest; and (iii) purported independent audits and litigation against Quest and its two directors. The complaint further alleges that in conducting the offer and sale of the limited partnerships, Quest drafted and sold the PAM, which contained false and misleading statements about Quest&#8217;s historical and near-term operations, its current and projected petroleum production from the Leases, (iv) its projected oil-and-gas production revenue from those leases, as well as the use of offering proceeds. In addition, in order to prevent the investors from receiving returns on their investments, they failed to disclose that Quest was under the control of a registered broker-dealer.

The SEC also charged John Leonard, a salesman residing in Naples and Chicago, with acting as an unregistered broker in offering and selling the investment.  The SEC alleges that between January 2010 and May 2011, the father-son duo of Paul and Jeffry Downey used Quest, an Albany, Texas-based oil and gas company, to fraudulently offer Quest preferred stock and limited partnership units in an entity called Permian Advanced Oil Recovery Investment Fund I, LP (PAOR).  Investors were told that PAOR would acquire working interests in oil and gas leases from Quest and receive revenue from those leases.  With assistance from unregistered salesman John Leonard, the Downeys raised $4.8 million from approximately 17 investors.  The PAOR offering was fraudulent on account of blatantly deceptive misstatements about Quest and PAOR.  More particularly, the Downeys made false statements in the private placement memorandum about the financial viability of Quest; the purchase debt and liens associated with certain leases in which PAOR was acquiring an interest; the current and projected petroleum production from the leases; the use of investor funds raised in the offering; independent audits of PAOR; and foreseeable litigation against Quest and the Downeys.

According to the SEC's complaint, Nutra Pharma Corp., a microcap issuer that purports to make pain relief drugs with cobra venom, and its CEO, Rik Deitsch, issued or posted six press releases that materially misled investors.  The releases allegedly implied, among other things, that Nutra Pharma was engaged in international distribution and sales of its product, when it was not, and that Nutra Pharma had upgraded its cobra farm facilities, when Nutra Pharma had no cobras, had no cobra farm, and had never produced cobra venom.  Nutra Pharma publicized many of these press releases while Nutra Pharma and Deitsch engaged in an unregistered distribution of its securities to retail investors.  In addition, on multiple occasions, Deitsch allegedly engaged in manipulative trading designed to ""walk up"" Nutra Pharma's stock price and create the appearance of active trading in Nutra Pharma.  Further, Nutra Pharma and Deitsch allegedly failed to make numerous required filings, including filings about the company's sales of unregistered securities and filings about Deitsch's beneficial ownership of the company's securities.  According to the SEC's complaint, Sean McManus, a consultant for Nutra Pharma, also made numerous misstatements while soliciting investors in Nutra Pharma.  In addition, McManus allegedly acted as an unregistered broker, despite being permanently barred in 2001 by the NASD (now FINRA) from associating with NASD member firms.  The SEC's complaint charges Nutra Pharma with violations of the antifraud, registration, and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The complaint also charges Deitsch with violations of the antifraud, anti-manipulation, beneficial ownership disclosure, registration, and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(a), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Nutra Pharma's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Finally, the complaint charges McManus with violations of the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties against all defendants, a penny stock bar against Deitsch and McManus, and an officer and director bar against Deitsch.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Moddha Interactive, Inc., a company that purports to be a ""worldwide Positive Media and Technology Corporation,"" and its chief technology officer, Marina Veronika Sandor, touted a purported ""Quantum Transducer"" technology that will ""revolutionize"" conventional mobile phones, allow consumers to operate tablet devices ""with the wave of your hand as if you were Tony Stark in Iron Man"" and produce ""a more elegant, thinner, healthier and more energy-efficient device than iPhone and Android.""  In reality, according to the complaint, however, it was a sham, and the defendants used investor funds to pay for their personal expenses and for the sole purpose of enriching themselves and their family members.&nbsp;The SEC also obtained a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of all defendants and prohibiting them from destroying documents. The court's order, among other things, prohibits the destruction of documents by any party, including the name of a registered broker, broker-dealer, or investment adviser, from being used as an unregistered broker or dealer in an offering of securities. In a related criminal proceeding, on August 2, 2017, a federal district court in the District of Hawaii entered a preliminary injunction against the three defendants, Michael Porrazzo, Edward M. Street and Michael Street, in connection with the same conduct. On July 10, 2019, Judge John W. Berry of the U.S. District Court in Honolulu granted the SECâs request for a permanent injunction and ordered the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $150,000.Â The court also entered orders freezing all assets held by the four defendants for five years, freezing their assets and appointing a receiver over the remaining assets, preventing the repatriation of funds, granting expedited discovery and preventing destruction, expediting discovery, providing an accounting of assets frozen in escrow and facilitating the discovery of any material, non-public information that may have been misused or misappropriated from investors.","The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to halt an ongoing offering fraud carried out by Marianne Veronika Sandor, her husband Edward Michael Porrazzo and their company, Moddha Interactive, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, which was unsealed on July 13, in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo told investors that Moddha Interactive had a valuable portfolio of patents for a supposed 3-D technology that can be used with tablet devices.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was false because Moddha Interactive's patents had expired and were worthless, and the technology they promoted either did not exist or was developed by other, unrelated companies.  Also, according to the SEC's complaint, in an effort to promote the safety of the investment in Moddha Interactive, Sandor and Porrazzo lied about a share dividend buy-back program and how they would use the investor funds they raised.  The complaint alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds to support their lifestyle.  In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that Moddha Interactive paid over $200,000 in sales commissions to their co-defendant, Spar Street, who illegally acted as an unregistered broker in selling Moddha Interactive's shares to investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed under seal on July 9, 2018, charges Sandor, Porrazzo and Moddha Interactive with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Melvyn Nathanson, Eric Nathson, Charles Peterein, and Ganis Company, Inc., Civil Action, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York  SEC CHARGES THREE INDIVIDUALS WITH FRAUD IN THE STOCK LENDING SCHEME   The Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the U. S. district court against three individuals and a corporate entity in connection with the securities lending, or ""stock loan,"" business. The complaint alleges that from July 2003 through April 2005, the defendants defrauded two securities brokerage firms out of a total of at least $1.16 million through the payment of sham finder fees and undisclosed kickbacks that ultimately came from the pockets of the two firms.  According to the complaint, M.N.anson worked as the stock loan trader in charge at the SEC's securities desk at PAX Clearing Corp., a Chicago-based registered broker-dealer. He was paid to arrange stock loans for Kellner, Dileo &amp; Co. (""Kellner""), a registered brokerage firm. Through SME Consultants, N.Y. (SME), the Defendants allegedly caused PAX and KDC Merger Arbitrage Fund, LP to engage in a kickback scheme to defraud the firms of approximately $2.2 million. In exchange, they allegedly directed kick-backs to PETERIN, a shell-company controlled by PETererin. Peterin was a principal associated with Sallerson-Troob, LLC, which ran PAX's Stock Loan Trading desk and ran the broker loan desk in New Jersey.

The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that from July 2003 through April 2005, the four defendants defrauded two securities brokerage firms out of a total of at least $1.16 million through the payment of sham finder fees and undisclosed kickbacks that ultimately came out of the pockets of the two brokerage firms.  The defendants named in the Commission&#8217;s complaint are:  Melyvn Nathanson (&#8220;M. Nathanson&#8221;), age 70, resides in Lady Lake, Florida.  From at least October 1998 to March 2006, M. Nathanson worked as a stock loan finder with SME, which he effectively controlled.  Eric Nathanson (&#8220;E. Nathanson&#8221;), age 43, resides in Lady Lake, Florida.  From October 1998 to March 2006, he worked as a stock loan finder with SME.  E. Nathanson is M. Nathanson&#8217;s son.  Charles Peterein (&#8220;Peterein&#8221;), age 59, resides in Evergreen Park, Illinois.  From September 2000 to May 2005, Peterein was a principal associated with PAX Clearing Corp. (&#8220;PAX&#8221;), a registered broker-dealer, and ran the firm&#8217;s stock loan trading desk.  Ganis Company, Inc. (&#8220;Ganis&#8221;) is an Illinois corporation with a business address in Evergreen Park, Illinois.  Peterein and his wife are both officers of Ganis, but Peterein alone effectively controls Ganis and its bank account.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint specifically alleges as follows:    During the relevant period, Peterein was the stock loan trader in charge of the securities lending desk at PAX, and M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson operated SME.  Through SME, M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson worked as consultants to Kellner, Dileo &amp; Co. (&#8220;Kellner&#8221;), a registered broker-dealer based in New York City, and were paid to arrange stock loan transactions for Kellner.  Pursuant to the defendants&#8217; scheme, Peterein caused PAX to engage in stock loans with Kellner on terms that deliberately favored Kellner at PAX&#8217;s expense and increased the amount of compensation that Kellner paid to SME.  In exchange, M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson directed kickbacks to Peterein by causing Kellner to pay sham finder fees on those stock loan transactions to Ganis, a shell-company controlled by Peterein.  The fees paid to Ganis were a sham because, unbeknownst to Kellner, Ganis did not perform any finding or other legitimate services on the transactions.  In addition, Peterein never told PAX that Peterein was receiving payments from Kellner, much less that the payments were kickbacks arranged by M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson to compensate Peterein for directing stock loan transactions to Kellner at rates that purposely disadvantaged PAX in order to generate payments to both SME and Ganis.  Peterein, M. Nathanson and E. Nathanson caused PAX and Kellner to engage in over 4,000 stock loans pursuant to their scheme, with Kellner paying a total of approximately $651,580 to SME and a total of approximately $513,788 to Ganis in sham finder fees.  All four defendants are charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and, in the alternative, with aiding and abetting each other&#8217;s violations of certain of the above provisions of the federal securities laws.

SEC Files Settled Action Against Avon, Connecticut Resident for Misappropriating Over $1 Million in Investor Assets   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Florina S., a Connecticut resident, alleging that, since at least 2008, she has improperly raised and misappropriated more than a half-million dollars in investor funds.  According to the Commission's complaint, from approximately January to October 2007, the defendant induced two elderly Connecticut women into providing him with investment funds to manage on their behalf. After these investors transferred their assets to Ilovi, he deposited the funds into accounts solely in his name and then used the proceeds to engage in risky and unauthorized personal trading.

(United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Civil Action No. 3:11-CV-00981-WWE)  Commission Obtains Temporary Restraining Order and Asset Freeze Against Connecticut Man Who Misappropriated Over $1 Million From Vulnerable Investors  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on June 20, 2011, it filed an emergency enforcement action in federal district court in Connecticut and obtained a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against Florin S. Ilovici, of Avon, Connecticut, in connection with a scheme to defraud investors. The Commission&#8217;s Complaint alleges that, since at least 2008, Ilovici made material misrepresentations in raising over $1 million in investment funds from at least two elderly Connecticut women who lived alone, had little or no family, and had health problems. Instead of investing these funds on their behalf as he promised, Ilovici transferred the investor funds to his personal bank and brokerage accounts where he either lost the funds in risky securities or foreign currency exchange trading or spent the funds on personal expenses, including mortgage and credit card payments, travel, and home improvements, all without the knowledge or authorization of his investors.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that Ilovici&#8217;s conduct violates Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also names Ilovici&#8217;s wife, Diana Ilovici, as a Relief Defendant. The Honorable Warren W. Eginton issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting Ilovici from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the foregoing statutory provisions, and an order freezing Ilovici&#8217;s assets, as well as certain assets of his wife that are believed to be derived from the proceeds of Ilovici&#8217;s fraudulent scheme. The Court&#8217;s order further provides that Ilovici is prohibited from soliciting or accepting additional investor funds and from altering or destroying any relevant documents, and the order also requires Ilovici to provide an accounting of his assets and his use of investor funds. The Court&#8217;s order also permits the Commission to conduct expedited discovery and provides other relief. In its action, the Commission seeks the entry of a preliminary injunction against Ilovici upon the expiration of the temporary restraining order, the entry of a permanent injunction against Ilovici, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains by both Ilovici and his wife plus pre-judgment interest thereon, and the imposition of a civil monetary penalty against Ilovici.

Cohn, and Robert M. Jaffe, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action Number CV 10791  SEC CHARGES BROKER-DEALER WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH MULTI-Billion DOLLAR PONZI SCHEME  On June 17, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Bernard L. Madoff, his daughter, co-owner and principal, et al., alleging that they participated in a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme by raising billions of dollars from hundreds of investors under a shroud of secrecy.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that for more than two decades the Defendants enabled Madoffs fraud by helping to conceal the existence of his investment advisory business and pretending that it was primarily a retail brokerage operation. The Complaint alleges the defendants specifically targeted affluent but financially unsophisticated investors, who were unlikely to notice unusual aspects of the investment. Contrary to the illusion they fostered that only the privileged few could invest with MadOFF, they were, in fact, engaged in an extremely well-organized marketing operation and derived virtually all of their revenues from introducing investors to MadOff. As reward for their stunning marketing success, Defendants were paid over $100 million through the company. In addition, defendants Maurice Cohn and Rachael Cohn also received millions of dollar in direct payments from BMIS. Among other things: The defendants were instrumental in the success of this scheme. They deceived investors by creating the false impression that investors would be admitted into their investment only as a special favor and outside the normal retail broker-dealer activity of CohMadoff. Defendants specifically sought to hide the nature and scope of a fraudulent investment from regulators for fear that regulatory scrutiny would expose his massive fraud. To that end, not only did he conceal his extensive brokerage business from SEC filings, but also concealed from investors that he was actively engaging in activity associated with his brokerage firm and that his representatives were acting on the firm's behalf. Additionally, as the complaint alleges, Jaffe, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, was privy to a practice of generating falsified confirmations and statements that reflected backdated","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21095 / June 22, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Cohmad Securities Corporation, Maurice J. Cohn, Marcia B. Cohn, and Robert M. Jaffe, (S.D.N.Y. Civ. 09 CV 5680)  SEC CHARGES MADOFF SOLICITORS WITH FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Cohmad Securities Corporation, a New York-based broker-dealer, as well as its chairman Maurice J. Cohn, chief operating officer Marcia B. Cohn, and registered representative Robert M. Jaffe alleging that they collectively raised billions of dollars from investors for Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme.  In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC charged the defendants for actively marketing investment opportunities with Madoff while knowingly or recklessly disregarding facts indicating that Madoff was operating a fraud. The SEC previously charged Madoff and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) as well as their auditors with committing securities fraud through a Ponzi scheme perpetrated on advisory and brokerage customers of BMIS.  The SEC's complaint against the Cohmad defendants alleges that while bringing investors to Madoff, they ignored and even participated in many suspicious practices that clearly indicated Madoff was engaged in fraud. For example, the SEC's complaint alleges that the Cohns and Cohmad filed false Forms BD and FOCUS reports that concealed Cohmad's primary business of bringing in investors for BMIS. This referral business comprised as much as 90 percent of Cohmad's revenue in some years, brought in more than 800 accounts, and billions of dollars into BMIS' advisory business, for which BMIS paid them more than $100 million.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that the compensation arrangement between BMIS and Cohmad indicated fraudulent conduct at BMIS. Cohmad was paid an annual percentage of the funds its representatives (except Jaffe) brought into BMIS offset by any withdrawals from those investor accounts. This compensation arrangement indicated to Cohmad and the Cohns that BMIS was not providing any real returns to investors. For example, where the client's principal investment had been $10,000, Cohmad stopped receiving fees if a client withdrew $15,000 from an account, even if under BMIS' management the account had purportedly grown to $100,000. In Cohmad's internal records, such an account was designated with a negative $5,000 number.  The SEC alleges that Jaffe also participated in Madoff's fraud by soliciting investors and bringing more than $1 billion into BMIS. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that Madoff compensated Jaffe with outsized returns in Jaffe's personal accounts that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were manufactured by BMIS employees entering fictitious, backdated trades onto trade confirmations and account statements for his personal accounts at BMIS.  The SEC's complaint against the Cohmad defendants specifically alleges that Cohmad violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder; that the Cohns violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder; and that Robert Jaffe violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 15(b)(7), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 15b7-1 and 17a-3 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder.  Among other things, the SEC's complaint seeks injunctions, financial penalties and a court order requiring Cohmad, the Cohns, and Jaffe to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.

Bradford, Life Foundation Trust, and Jeanette B. Wilcher, Case No.: 1:01-CV-00707 (C.D. Cal.)  SEC CHARGES HITSGALORE.COM AND ITS FORMER PRESIDENT WITH FRAUDULENT PRINCIPAL OF FALSE PRESS RELEASES   The Securities &amp;Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Hitsgoore., a now-defunct Nevada corporation, its then-president, a resident of Irvine, Calif., and its former president, the former vice president of marketing, for making false and misleading press releases about a purported $10 million investment by a California-based company.  According to the Commission's complaint, between April 16 and May 10, 1999, Hitsgore and the company issued three press Releases that falsely stated that a $100 million private placement investment was imminent and an agreement in principle was in place for an additional $200 million in an asset management agreement. The defendants also misrepresented the nature of the investment, including that the funds would be used to pay the $20 million purchase price and to retain a long-term investor. In reality, as the complaint alleges, no such investment existed and no funds had ever been invested. On the basis of these false claims, hitgoosebumps and other compensation payments were paid by Hitsgaore to its shareholders, who were not required to invest any capital in Hitsaga and thus could not pay a penny of any value to any of those shareholders. As a result of this conduct, hitsagaore's stock price increased from $6.3125 per share to a record high of $21.25 on May 11. By selling all of its shares within weeks of their public release, it was a total of more than $1.2 million, which the defendants made a profit of over $2.5 million on the sale of all Hitsgathelore shares.The complaint further alleges that, contrary to all previous statements about the value of Hitsago's investments in its stock, all three defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 17249 / November 29, 2001  SEC v. Hitsgalore.com, Inc., Stephen J. Bradford, Life Foundation Trust and Jeanette B. Wilcher, Civil Action No. SACV 01-1133 GLT (ANx)  (C.D. Cal.).  On November 28, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging securities fraud against Hitsgalore.com, Inc. (&quot;Hitsgalore&quot;) and its former president, Stephen J. Bradford (&quot;Bradford&quot;).  Hitsgalore was an Internet company located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, that maintained a website providing an Internet search engine and leasing advertising space to consumers.  The company has changed its name to Diamond Hitts Productions, Inc. and relocated to Irvine, California.  The complaint charges Hitsgalore and Bradford with fraud in connection with several press releases issued by the company in 1999 that contained false and misleading statements about a purported investment in Hitsgalore by a Scottsdale, Arizona, for-profit trust, Life Foundation Trust (&quot;Life Foundation&quot;).  The complaint also charges Life Foundation and its trustee and administrator, Jeanette B. Wilcher (&quot;Wilcher&quot;), a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona, with aiding and abetting Hitsgalore's and Bradford's fraud and seeks disgorgement of over $1 million from Life Foundation as a result of its illegal sale of Hitsgalore stock in violation of federal securities registration requirements.  The Commission's action, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that between April 16 and May 10, 1999, Hitsgalore and Bradford issued three false and misleading press releases regarding: (1) a purported $10 million private placement investment by Life Foundation in Hitsgalore, and (2) an agreement in principle between Life Foundation and Hitsgalore for an additional $100 million investment in Hitsgalore.  Bradford drafted all three press releases.  Life Foundation's Wilcher conducted all negotiations on Life Foundation's behalf and assisted Bradford in drafting, reviewing and approving the April 16 press release prior to its dissemination.  The press releases falsely indicated that Life Foundation would be making immediate payments to Hitsgalore in return for shares in the company, and that Life Foundation would be holding all of its Hitsgalore shares as a long-term investor.  However, Life Foundation was not required to make any payments until one year after the agreements, it sold most of its Hitsgalore shares within weeks of the press releases at a profit of over $1 million, and it never paid Hitsgalore any money for the shares.  The fraudulent press releases caused a dramatic rise in the price of Hitsgalore's stock, quoted on the OTCBB from $6.3125 to a high of $20.125.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Hitsgalore and Bradford violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Life Foundation and Wilcher aided and abetted those violations and that Life Foundation violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all the defendants, civil penalties against Bradford, Life Foundation and Wilcher, and disgorgement of the approximately $1 million in ill-gotten gains obtained by Life Foundation in connection with the illegal sale of its Hitsgalore stock.  Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission's complaint, Hitsgalore and Bradford settled the action by consenting to a permanent injunction, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, for the violations outlined above.

Action Action 5-05-CV-1890 (N.D.Nx)  SEC CHARGES FORMER BIOTECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE WITH INSIDER TRADING  On April 26, 2004, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Dr. Nasir Hanna of Rancho Santa Fe, California, engaged in insider trading in advance of the September 8, 2003 announcement that Biogen, Inc. had entered into an agreement to develop and market a potential cancer treatment known as the VEGF-Trap.  The Commission's complaint alleges that in early July 2003, while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning the potential joint venture, Hanna purchased 17,500 shares of Regeneron stock at prices ranging from $13.95 to $14.15 per share, realizing a profit of $124,000. According to the complaint, during the course of these confidential discussions, which continued through early September and continued into early October, and Hanna sold his shares one day after the public announcement, he realized profits of over $125,00. Without admitting or denying the allegations, however, in a complaint filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., Hanna has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. He has also consented to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a penalty equal to his trading profits. The settlement is subject to approval by the court. In a related matter, on November 30, 2002, a federal judge entered a temporary restraining order against Hanna and ordered him to surrender his passport and other documents, including a copy of a Form 10-K filed with the Court on September 11, after which he would be barred from serving as an officer or director of any biotechnology company that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12(d) or the Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"").

Hanna, 05 CV 3996 (LTS) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC SETTLES INSIDER TRADING MATTER AGAINST FORMER CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER OF BIOGEN IDEC, INC.  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Dr. Nabil Hanna (""Hanna"").  Hanna is a resident of Rancho Santa Fe, California, and the former Executive Vice President of Research and Chief Scientific Officer of Biogen Idec, Inc. (""Biogen"").  In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Hanna obtained approximately $124,000 in illicit profits from insider trading in the securities of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Regeneron"") in advance of Regeneron's announcement on September 8, 2003 that it had entered into an agreement with Aventis, SA to develop and market a potential cancer treatment known as the VEGF-Trap (""the VEGF-Trap"").   More specifically, in its Complaint, the Commission alleged the following.  In early July 2003, Regeneron's representatives contacted Biogen to discuss a potential joint venture to develop and market Regeneron's VEGF-Trap.  Shortly thereafter, Biogen representatives, including Hanna, and Regeneron representatives began discussing the possible joint venture.  During the course of these confidential discussions, which continued through early September, Hanna learned that the VEGF-Trap was scientifically and commercially viable; that Regeneron's preclinical stage testing of the VEGF-Trap produced positive results; that the VEGF-Trap had blockbuster sales potential; and the financial terms Regeneron required for the joint venture.  On August 18 and 19, 2003, while in possession of this material, nonpublic information, Hanna purchased 17,500 shares of Regeneron stock at prices ranging from $13.95 to $14.15 per share.  On September 9, 2003, one day after Regeneron announced its agreement with Aventis, SA , Hanna sold all 17,500 shares of Regeneron stock at $21.15 per share, realizing a profit of $124,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, Hanna consented to the entry of a final judgment by the Court, which permanently enjoins Hanna from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Hanna also consented to pay disgorgement of $124,000, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $248,000.  Additionally, Hanna agreed to the entry of an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Utah)  SEC CHARGES HUSBAND WITH FRAUD IN OFFERING OF PAYDAY LOAN SCHEMES  On March 24, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Utah filed a civil injunctive action against John ""Scott"" Clark and his companies, ImpactCash, LLC and ImpactPayment Systems LLC, which operated an online pay-day loan company.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from 2006 through September 20, 2008, Clark raised more than $47 million from at least 120 investors in unregistered transactions, using new investor funds to fund business and personal expenses, and misappropriating money from investors for his personal benefit. The complaint further alleges Clark misused investors' money for personal purposes, including to pay off loans to friends and family members and to make payments to other investors. According to the complaint, from March 2006 to September 2011, all of the funds raised by the defendants were used by Clark to repay earlier investors and fund his own business ventures. As a result, investors were left with little or no recourse for their investments. In addition, as alleged in the Complaint, no money was ever transferred to Clark's companies and no funds were ever used for any purpose other than to provide for purposes of paying dayloans for customers. Clark did not invest investor money as represented, but instead diverted it to investors and used new investors to prop up the company's stock price and generate profits for himself and others. To conceal his fraud and other personal misstatements, such as his use of investor monies to purchase a $25,000 convertible convertible note, purchased an $8,500 sports utility vehicle, used $3,400 in cash to buy a new Mercedes Benz AMT, $500,00 in jewelry and $1,100 in other luxury items, paid the operating expenses of his company, Inc., and paid other investor fees.

In addition to the asset freeze, the court has appointed a receiver to preserve and marshal assets for the benefit of investors. That Receiver is Gil A. Miller.  The complaint alleges that from March 2006 through September 2010, Impact and Clark (by himself and through sales persons) raised more than $47 million from at least 120 investors for the stated purposes of funding payday loans, purchasing lists of leads for payday loan customers, and paying the operating expenses of Impact. The complaint further alleges that Clark did not deploy investor capital to make payday loans as represented, but instead diverted investor funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle, including buying expensive cars, art and a home theatre system. Clark also misappropriated investor money to fund outside business ventures and used new investor funds to pay purported profits to earlier investors.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint charges Impact and Clark with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Clark with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Deephaven Capital Management, LLC and Bruce Lieberman, United States District Court for the District of Columbia  SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Charges Against Former Hedge Fund Manager   The Commission today filed insider trading charges against two former hedge fund managers at a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based investment adviser.  According to the Commission's complaint, from August 2001 to March 2004, Bruce ""Deephaven"" Lieberman (""Lieberman"") engaged in short selling of securities in advance of public announcements of 19 Private Investment in Public Equity (""PIPE"") offerings that are the subject of this Complaint. The complaint alleges that Lieberman executed all the short sales while in possession of material nonpublic information, in breach of a duty of trust and confidence owed to placement agents and issuers to maintain confidentiality and not to trade on the basis of such information. For each of the 19 offerings, the placement agent instructed Lieberman or someone at his direction that the issuer was conducting a PPE offering, which he knew or were reckless in not knowing was highly confidential. Lieberman attempted to hide his short positions previously established by transferring them to another fund he managed. As a result of his conduct described in the complaint and filed in federal court in Minnesota, this action violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted the violations of Sections 13(d)(5), 14(e), and 15(j)(2)(A) by the defendants. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lieberman consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to his trading profits. In addition, he agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years and to cooperate fully with the SEC's continuing investigation and disciplinary proceedings.

SEC SUES HEDGE FUND ADVISER DEEPHAVEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC AND FORMER PORTFOLIO MANAGER BRUCE LIEBERMAN FOR INSIDER TRADING BEFORE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF PIPE OFFERINGS  Defendants Agree to Injunction and Payout of $5.8 Million in Penalties and Disgorgement  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against hedge fund adviser Deephaven Capital Management, LLC and its former portfolio manager Bruce Lieberman, charging them with insider trading from August 2001 to March 2004 on the information that 19 private investment in public equity (PIPE) stock offerings were about to be publicly announced.  In each case, the company's stock price fell on the announcement of its PIPE offering.  The defendants learned confidential material nonpublic details about the upcoming PIPE offerings from placement agents for the companies and sold short the company shares on behalf of the Deephaven Small Cap Growth Fund, LLC, profiting from the price decline when the PIPE offerings were publicly announced.  Short selling includes the practice of selling borrowed shares in the expectation that the price will fall, enabling the seller to then buy and deliver the shares at a lower price.  The Commission's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that Deephaven and Lieberman violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that:  In each of 19 PIPE offerings, a broker-dealer retained by the company as placement agent advised Lieberman or his assistant of the upcoming offering and that the information was confidential nonpublic information.  In each case, Deephaven and Lieberman had a duty to maintain the information in confidence and to refrain from trading in the company's shares;&nbsp;  In four of the offerings, the placement agent used a written telephone  script that alerted Deephaven that knowledge of the PIPE offering was confidential and could be considered material nonpublic information;&nbsp;  In one offering, the placement agent cautioned Lieberman's assistant by letter about the obligation under the federal securities laws not to trade in the company's securities while in possession of material nonpublic information.  Lieberman was alerted to the confidential nonpublic nature of the information when he signed a securities purchase agreement in which the company characterized the PIPE shares offering as material nonpublic information, yet he shorted the company's stock on 13 different days before public announcement of the PIPE offering; and&nbsp;  In two of the PIPE offerings, Lieberman falsely signed a written security purchase agreement expressly warranting that the Small Cap Growth Fund had not shorted the company's stock; he transferred short positions the fund had in fact taken to another Deephaven fund he controlled, in an attempt to hide the short sales in violation of the warranties.  Deephaven and Lieberman have each consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  Deephaven also agreed to disgorge $2,683,270 in unlawful profits, plus $343,418 prejudgment interest, and to pay a $2,683,270 civil penalty.  Lieberman agreed to pay a $110,000 civil penalty and to a Commission order barring him from associating with any investment adviser, with the right to reapply after three years, in an administrative proceeding to be instituted based on entry of the anticipated final judgment.

Vitale, Civil Action Number 1:10-CV-20408-JAL (Southern District of Florida)  SEC CHARGES TWO BUSINESSMEN WITH FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH BANK CONVERSION SCHEMES  On February 10, 2010, the United States District Court in Miami, Florida, entered a final judgment against two business men charged with defrauding the banks and their investment banks in connection with a series of bank convertible securities offerings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the Southern District, alleges that from approximately January 2005 until March 2007, Samuel and Joyce d'Avale made approximately $659,512 in profits from the fraudulent conversion of stock in at least seven public offerings that were being conducted in violation of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint:   From approximatelyJanuary 2005 through March2007, defendants used four relatives and several business associates to illegally acquire the shares of banks which were converting frommutual ownership to bank shares.&nbsp;  Defendants used six business partners and one business associate to secretly place orders for the purchase and sale of shares in these conversion transactions. The defendants sold the stock through their nominees and then used the proceeds to pay other business expenses, including mortgage payments, car loans, rent, and other expenses. In addition, Defendants diverted the funds to other purposes, such as to purchase vehicles for themselves and for their personal use, or to make payments on behalf of other depositors. These transactions were designed to ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority stocksubscription rights, which are required by federal and state banking regulations to transfer ownership of certain stocks to any one person at a time. To prevent the diversion of these priority shares into the bank accounts of others and to facilitate the transfer of such shares to others, these transactions violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from approximately January 2005 until March 2007, the Defendants spearheaded a scheme to defraud the banks and their depositors by secretly using relatives and business entities as nominees to acquire stock in those conversions in contravention of the offering terms and applicable banking regulations. Over the course of the fraudulent scheme, the Defendants reaped $659,512 in ill-gotten profits from secondary market sales of the fraudulently obtained stock.The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants sought to circumvent federal and state banking regulations that prohibit the depositors of the converting banks from either transferring ownership of their stock subscription rights, or entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering. The SEC alleges that the Defendants and their nominees opened accounts at seven mutual savings banks and when the banks undertook a conversion the Defendants secretly purchased the bank stock through their nominees, controlled the sale of these shares, and retained most of the trading profits. The SEC's complaint further alleges that the Defendants directed the nominees to submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer shares or the proceeds of their sale to anyone else. The Defendant's scheme limited the amount of stock available to other depositors.The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Samuel and Joyce Vitale violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Samuel and Joyce Vitale have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from committing future violations of the above provisions, and orders them to pay $757,179 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $150,000 in civil penalties each.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Ross founded Direct Lending Investments, LLC (DLI) in 2012 and was the 100% owner, chief executive officer, and managing member of DLI's investment management and advisory advisory firms. The complaint alleges that between spring 2014 and fall 2017, he engaged in a multi-year effort to artificially inflate the valuation of the Funds' investment position by approximately $53 million, which resulted in misstatements to investors and at least $5-6 million in over-charges of management, performance and fees to certain funds. In March 2019, after being confronted by a committee of senior executives demanding that Ross resign and be re-instated as an officer and director of a public company, according to a complaint filed by the Commission. As a result of this conduct, DLi allegedly overstated its asset value by more than $50 million and materially misstated the funds' returns. Ross allegedly concealed his scheme by providing investors with monthly fact sheets that detailed the returns and performance data that were included in the fund's financial statements, as well as the monthly loss reserves data for those investments. To conceal his misconduct, including lying to other fund management personnel and failing to disclose his knowledge of and his role in, these false and misleading payments to fund managers and other third parties, caused the Fund to overstate its assets by as much as $6.5 million. Without admitting or denying the allegations in Ross's SEC filings, DIRECT LENDING AGREES TO PAY $1.2 MILLION IN disgorgement and a civil penalty of $100,000, in amounts to be determined by court at a later date.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from early 2014 through late 2017, Ross manipulated payment data for the funds' investment in loans made by QuarterSpot, Inc., an online small business lender.  Ross allegedly directed QuarterSpot to make payments to the funds, which gave the false impression that underlying borrowers were making principal payments on what were actually delinquent loans.  As alleged, under DLI's valuation policy, many of these non-performing loans should have been fully marked down but were not because of the payments Ross engineered.  According to the complaint, as a result of the scheme, DLI's monthly returns reported to investors were materially inflated.  DLI allegedly collected at least $5-6 million in extra management and performance fees from the funds, and Ross personally received millions of dollars from DLI.  The SEC previously charged DLI in 2019, which resulted in DLI and its affiliates being placed in receivership.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, over the past three years, from at least 2008 through the present, Temm and his entities have raised more than $35 million from investors seeking to purchase distressed residential mortgage loans so that those loans could be restructured in order to become performing loans. To lure those investors, according to the complaint:  As a result of the conduct described above, investors were told that they would receive returns based on either payments from the home or the underlying property. Investors were also allegedly promised that their money would be used to pay off other investors or to make loans on their behalf.

James G. Temme and Stewardship Fund LP, Civil Action No. 4:11-cv-00655-MHS (E.D. Tx.)  SEC HALTS SCHEME INVOLVING INVESTMENTS TO PURPORTEDLY HELP HOMEOWNERS RESTRUCTURE MORTGAGES  On October 18, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a Texas resident and his company charged with falsely telling investors he was using their money to buy and restructure pools of non-performing home mortgages in the wake of the housing market&#8217;s decline.  In its complaint, filed on October 14, 2011 and unsealed by the court on October 18, the SEC alleges that James G. &#8220;Jay&#8221; Temme and Stewardship Fund LP raised at least $35&nbsp;million since 2008 from various investor groups.&nbsp; To lure those investors, Temme developed relationships with people and entities who &#8220;vouched&#8221; for Temme, including an investment adviser representative with a major investment bank&#8217;s private wealth management group and a Texas-based public company that provides mortgage restructuring services.&nbsp; Investors and their advisers, including the bank representative, were told by Temme that he was using the investors&#8217; money to purchase &#8220;tapes&#8221; of non-performing mortgages from mortgage lenders at a discount and then paying returns based on principal and interest payments he collected from the homeowners, or based on the resale of the mortgages or underlying properties.&nbsp; In several instances, however, Temme was claiming to own mortgages he had never acquired or purporting to transfer the same pool of mortgages to multiple sets of investors. &nbsp;To carry out his scheme, Temme created false documents, made unauthorized financial transactions, and used new investor funds to pay off earlier investors.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Temme has been the subject of at least one state court asset freeze and various private lawsuits by different investor groups.&nbsp; However, rather than stopping his scheme, Temme ignored the asset freezes, opened new bank accounts, and raised money from new investors to settle suits filed by earlier investors.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained, the SEC seeks a preliminary injunction and a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.&nbsp;   The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael H.

David Radler and Hollinger International, Inc., Civil Action Number 04-CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:04-CV-1431 (N.D. Ill.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER CEO OF HALLINGER INTERNATIONAL WITH FRAUDULENT AND CONDUCTED SCHEME TO DISCLOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  On December 19, 2005, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that, from at least 1999 to 2003, former CEO and COO Conrad Black engaged in a fraudulent and deceptive scheme to divert millions of dollars of cash and other assets from a public company that owns and operates newspaper publishing businesses in Europe and North America. The Commission's complaint alleges that Black and his company, The C onrad Black Capital Corporation, conducted the fraudulent scheme through a series of related party transactions, including, among other things, purported ""non-competition"" payments by which Black diverted to themselves, and to other corporate insiders, approximately $85 million of the proceeds from the sale of newspaper publications to third parties. According to the complaint, in February 2003 Black authorized the investment of $2.5 million by a venture capital fund with which he was affiliated. Moreover, Black misled the investing public about his intention to devote his time to an effort to sell all of his holdings, not to undermine that process by engaging in transactions for his own benefit. To perpetrate their scheme, he misrepresented and omitted to state material facts regarding the related-party transactions in his annual reports and filings with the SEC and during his tenure as CEO. In addition, during the period from 1998 through November 2003 he approved a press release that he misled investors about the purpose of selling the company's stock holdings. As a result of these alleged non-Competition payments, portions of sale proceeds which should have gone to him went to himself, or to his associates, to another company owned and controlled by Black. Additionally, as a control person of Hollingers International Inc. (collectively, ""Defendants""), Black approved the purchase of a $1.00 convertible fund by another entity owned by the same entity.

Hollinger International, Inc.).   On the same date, the SEC obtained a federal court order to ensure that the work of the Special Committee of Hollinger International's board of directors - including its efforts to recover and preserve corporate assets - continued under the jurisdiction and oversight of the court.  Hollinger International consented to the entry of the order, which also permanently enjoined the company from violating the reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  Under that order (See SEC Lit. Rel. 18551, Jan. 16, 2004), Hollinger International is required to maintain its Special Committee to, among other things, continue its investigation of alleged misconduct and its efforts to recover and maintain corporate assets.

J. Kenneth Stringer III, et al., United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Civil Action No.: 04-CV-00383 (DLC)  SEC Charges Three Former FLIR Executives with Fraudulent Revenue Recognition Schemes   On September 29, 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Portland, Oregon against three former senior executives of Portland-based FLir Systems, Inc. (FLIR), alleging that they engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to inflate revenue at the company during 1998 and 1999. The Commission's complaint alleges that the fraudulent conduct was carried out by four senior officers and employees, including the former President and Chief Executive Officer, and former Senior Vice President of Sales Operations, William N. Martin, of Lake Oswego, Ore., and Director of sales for Airborne Products Worldwide, Steven R. Eagleburger of Westlake Village, Wash., a CPA and a former CFO, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Sections 20(a), 21(d)(3)(A), and 27(b)(2)(B) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 20a-1, 21b2-2 and 21d-3 thereunder.

As a result of their violations, FL IRIR overstated its income statement and balance sheet by overstating losses before income taxes by 11% and understate pre-tax earnings by 578% in the first quarter of 1999; and by operating a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme that resulted in overstatement of net income by 60% for year-end 1998. These practices violated Florida IR's own internal accounting controls, which were inconsistent with the policies and procedures established by the","SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 17760 / October 1, 2002  Accounting and Auditing Release No. 1639 / October 1, 2002  SEC v.

Eagleburger, (U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Civil Action No. CV02-1341 (ST))  SEC CHARGES FORMER MANAGEMENT OF FLIR SYSTEMS, INC. WITH SCHEME TO INFLATE REVENUE  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a complaint on September 30, 2002 against four former senior executives of government contractor FLIR Systems, Inc. for engaging in a wide-ranging scheme to inflate earnings in 1998 and 1999.  The former executives charged today are FLIR's former President and CEO, J. Kenneth Stringer III; its former Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO, J. Mark Samper; its former Vice President of Sales for Airborne Products Worldwide, William N. Martin; and its former Director of Sales Operations, Steven R. Eagleburger.  Samper, Martin, and Eagleburger settled the Commission's action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  FLIR, based in Portland, Oregon, manufactures infrared imaging equipment.  FLIR's customers include government and commercial users, and its products are used for surveillance and reconnaissance, among other things.  Its stock is listed on Nasdaq's National Market.  FLIR restated its 1998 and 1999 financial statements three times in 2000 and 2001 to correct its financials.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Stringer, Samper, Martin, and Eagleburger engaged in fraudulent accounting practices throughout 1998 and 1999 in order to meet revenue and earnings projections.  The actions taken by these individuals caused FLIR to report false financial information in FLIR's annual and quarterly reports in 1998 and 1999.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this scheme, FLIR's pre-tax earnings in 1998 and 1999 were overstated by at least 25% to as much as 578%; in one quarter FLIR reported a profit of $411,000 when it actually had a loss of $325,000.  In 1998, FLIR reported that it had earned $22.2 million before taxes for the year when in fact FLIR had earned less than half that amount.  The complaint alleges that as a result of pressure to meet earnings targets by Stringer, Samper, Martin, and Eagleburger caused FLIR's overstatement of earnings by engaging in six improper revenue recognition practices:     False Sales  FLIR recognized revenue on four transactions in which no customer placed an order.   Placeholders  FLIR recognized revenue on eight transactions in which it shipped units - termed &quot;placeholders&quot; at FLIR -  that were not what the customer ordered.  FLIR shipped placeholder units to a third party warehouse, recognized revenue on shipment, then brought the units back to be replaced or reworked per customer specifications.   Side Agreements  FLIR recognized revenue on three transactions in which it offered additional terms such as rights or return, special discounts, or extended payment terms documented in side agreements with the customer.   Rentals  FLIR recognized revenue on two transactions that were not sales in substance because title to the product had not passed to the customer.   Contingent Orders and Consignment Sales  FLIR recognized revenue on four transactions that contained unresolved contingencies or were consignment sales.   Improper Bill and Hold Sales  FLIR recognized revenue on six transactions based upon non-binding letters of intent or inadequate purchase commitments from the customer.  In addition to these improper revenue practices, the complaint also alleges that Samper caused FLIR to fraudulently overstate assets and understate expenses in each quarter in 1999 by improperly using suspense accounts and by double-booking accounts receivables.  The defendants are:   J. Kenneth Stringer III, 49, of Lake Oswego, Oregon, FLIR's former CEO and President.  The SEC seeks an injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, and an order prohibiting Stringer from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company.  The complaint alleges that Stringer participated in fraudulent sales transactions, that he knew or was reckless in not knowing about the revenue recognition schemes perpetrated by management, and that he lied about the schemes to FLIR's independent auditors.  The complaint further alleges that Stringer received a 1998 bonus of $180,000 which he would not have received had FLIR accurately reported its earnings.   J. Mark Samper, 41, of Portland, Oregon, FLIR's former CFO and Senior Vice President of Finance.  Samper simultaneously settled the SEC's action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Samper agreed to the entry of a court order enjoining him from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws, barring him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company, and ordering him to pay $52,500 in disgorgement (representing his 1998 bonus), $8,859 in prejudgment interest, and $110,000 as a civil money penalty.  The complaint alleges that Samper was responsible for FLIR's financial record keeping and reporting, signed FLIR's periodic reports filed with the SEC, authorized revenue recognition for false sales, placeholders, rentals, consignment sales, and bill and hold sales with insufficient commitments from customers, caused the double-booking of two transactions, used suspense accounts to inflate FLIR's results, and lied to the auditors.     William N. Martin, 46, of Lake Oswego, Oregon, FLIR's former Vice President of Sales for Airborne Products Worldwide.  Martin simultaneously settled the SEC's action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Martin agreed to the entry of a court order enjoining him from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws, barring him bar from serving as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company for a period of ten years, and ordering him to pay $40,000 in disgorgement (representing his 1998 bonus), $7,025 in prejudgment interest, and $40,000 as a civil money penalty.  The complaint alleges that Martin authorized and directed sales personnel to obtain non-binding letters of intent, contingent purchase orders, side letters with rights of return, and rental agreements, and that he lied to FLIR's auditors about the scheme.   Steven R. Eagleburger, 55, of West Linn, Oregon, FLIR's former Director of Sales Operations.  Eagleburger simultaneously settled the SEC's action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Eagleburger agreed to the entry of a court order enjoining him from committing future violations of the charged federal securities laws and to pay a civil money penalty of $25,000.  The complaint alleges that Eagleburger facilitated the fraudulent scheme by authorizing and ordering manufacturing personnel to ship placeholder units and directing the entry of sales orders with insufficient or no documentation.  The Commission charged Stringer, Samper, Martin, and Eagleburger with violating or aiding and abetting violations of numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions (Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and additionally as to Samper and Stringer, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933), reporting provisions (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and additionally as to Stringer, Samper, and Martin, Rule 13a-13 of the Exchange Act), the record-keeping provisions (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder), internal controls provisions (Sections 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act) and as to Stringer, Samper, and Martin, the lying-to-an-accountant provision (Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act).   &nbsp;     SEC Complaint in this matter   http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17760.htm     Home | Previous Page Modified: 10/03/2002",0.7818,0.3468

Over a 20-month period, he transferred more than $400,000 of these funds into Issuer A, a microcap company based in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China.

The court also froze the assets of the defendants, and ordered the repatriation of all assets in the amount of $1.6 million to the relief agency, which is investigating the alleged fraud and the possible collapse of an investment program that raised more than $5 million from at least 125 investors nationwide and in Japan, many of whom are members of Deaf communities.

(""BCI"") and its CEO Marvin R. Cooper.  The Complaint alleges that BCI and Cooper raised $4.4 million from 125 investors since at least September 2007 and specifically targeted members of the Deaf community in the United States and Japan.  The Complaint, filed in federal court in Honolulu, Hawaii, alleges that BCI and Cooper represented to the investors that their funds would be invested in the foreign exchange (""Forex"") markets, that investors would receive returns of up to 25% compounded monthly from such trading, and that their investments were safe.  According to the Complaint, BCI and Cooper actually used only a net $800,000 (cash deposits minus cash withdrawals) of investor funds for Forex trading, and they lost more than $750,000 from their Forex trading.  The Complaint further alleges that BCI and Cooper failed to generate sufficient funds from their Forex trading to pay the promised returns and operated as a Ponzi scheme by paying returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.  The Complaint also alleges that Cooper misappropriated at least $1.4 million in investor funds to pay for a new home and other personal expenses.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its lawsuit, the Commission obtained an order temporarily enjoining BCI and Cooper from future violations of these provisions.  The Commission also obtained an order:  (1) freezing the assets of BCI and Cooper; (2) appointing a temporary receiver over BCI; (3) preventing the destruction of documents; (4) granting expedited discovery; and (5) requiring BCI and Cooper to provide accountings.  The Commission also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against both defendants.  A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued against the defendants and whether a permanent receiver should be appointed is scheduled for March 2, 2009, at 9:00 a.m. HST.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") also filed an emergency action against BCI and Cooper, alleging violations of the antifraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, and the State of Hawaii's Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (""DCCA""), Office of the Commissioner of Securities, issued a preliminary order to cease and desist against BCI and Cooper.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Hawaii DCCA's Office of the Commissioner of Securities and the assistance of the CFTC in this matter.

Khanna and MAK I Enterprises Group, LLC, Case No CV-0984 BTM (SD. CA)  SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA-BASED INVESTMENT COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL WITH FRAUDULENT OFFERING SCHEME   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against San Diego-based broker-dealer First Opportunities Management Group LLC and its principal, Sharanjit K.Khanna, for conducting an unregistered offering of securities in violation of the federal securities laws. The Commission's complaint alleges that from about 2003 to the present, the defendants have raised at least $70 million from 300 investors located in multiple states including Texas, California, Missouri, Kentucky, New York and several other states.  According to its complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles on August 17, and unsealed yesterday, Khannanjit told investors that he would pool investor funds to invest in various investment programs including foreign currency products, commercial paper and other guaranteed investments. He also assured investors their investments were insured, when in fact they were not. In fact, he allegedly misappropriated funds from a family associated with a charitable foundation in Texas and used them to pay for personal expenses, such as car payments, house payments and mortgage payments. To cover up his fraudulent scheme, a California company and a Texas company have agreed to a court order barring them from destroying documents and from using them for any period of time, including for business purposes. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Commission complaint, Thirteen Capital Management, Inc. has consented to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 13(1), 14(2), 15(3), 16(4), 17(5), 19(8), 20(9), 21(11), 23(13), 24(14), 25(20), 26(24), 27(31), 28(32), 29(33), 31(34), 30","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21181 / August 20, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

SEC HALTS PHONY INVESTMENT POOL BY SAN DIEGO PROMOTER  The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) obtained an asset freeze and court order halting an ongoing securities fraud orchestrated by a San Diego, Calif. promoter.    The Commission alleges that Mohit A. Khanna, who was barred in 2004 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), claimed to have raised as much as $70 million from 300 investors though his company, MAK 1 Enterprises Group, LLC.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that the defendants solicited investors in Southern California and several other states, as well as a charitable foundation, through word-of-mouth referrals and MAK 1&#8217;s website.  The Commission further alleges that the defendants claimed to pool investor funds to invest in commercial paper, foreign currency trading products, and other guaranteed investments.  The complaint alleges that the investment products Khanna claimed to have invested in were non-existent.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Khanna misused investor funds to pay for several luxury cars and residential properties, including those now owned by his wife, Sharanjit Khanna of San Diego, Calif., who was also named as a relief defendant.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint, which was filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that investor accounts would be FDIC and SIPC insured and were &#8220;insured&#8221; by insurance policies purchased by the defendants.  The complaint alleges Khanna fabricated and gave to an accountant a &#8220;screen shot&#8221; of MAK 1&#8217;s online banking activity purporting to show a balance of over $50 million in its bank account.  The defendants obtained a letter verifying the account balance from the accountant which was sent to investors.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the average daily balance in that account never exceeded $197,000.  The complaint also alleges the defendants concealed Khanna&#8217;s FINRA-bar which resulted from unrelated, alleged fraudulent conduct.    The Honorable Roger T. Benitez, United States District Judge, on August 18, 2009 granted the Commission&#8217;s application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing defendants&#8217; assets, prohibiting the destruction of documents, requiring accountings, granting expedited discovery, repatriating funds, and requiring Khanna to surrender his passport.  The Judge also appointed LaBella &amp; McNamara LLP as the temporary receiver over the assets of MAK 1 and its affiliates.  On August 31, 2009, the Court will hold a hearing on the Commission&#8217;s motion for a preliminary injunction and appointment of a permanent receiver.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint charges defendants with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and names as relief defendants Khanna&#8217;s wife and another company Khanna controls, First Opportunities Management Group, Inc.  The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received ill-gotten gains from Khanna&#8217;s fraud.  In addition to the emergency relief, the Commission seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against Khanna and MAK 1.

According to the SEC's complaint, in 2014, while serving as a board member of the company's board of directors, medical action's CEO told his father and brother that Owens & Minor Inc., a Virginia-based healthcare logistics company, was going to acquire medical Action. The complaint alleges that, shortly before the markets opened, MedicalAction's stock price rose to around $13.80 per share, and the brothers sold their entire position within a few days of learning about the potential deal. In a parallel action, U.S. District Court Judge John O'Halloran entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief. On May 5 and 5 of this year, Judge Roback entered an order freezing the assets of Barber's Father and Brother. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or any other relief, Barber has consented to a permanent injunction and a cease-and-desist order from future violations of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as to pay disgorgement of $145,000 and prejudgment interest totaling $7,828, respectively, of his own ill-gotten gains, plus a civil penalty, for a total of approximately $1,500, which represents a 35% premium over the prior day's trading price. Barbera's father also agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 5(c) to 5 (a), and (b)(2)(A) &#8212; and Rules 5a-14, 5b2-1 and 17b3-2 there under.

Barbera (""Barbera""), learned that Owens & Minor, Inc., a Virginia-based healthcare logistics company, was going to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Medical Action Industries, Inc. (""Medical Action""), a Brentwood, New York, medical products supplier. According to the complaint, Barbera then told his father and brother that they should purchase Medical Action stock in advance of the acquisition so that they could profit from the deal. The SEC alleges that Barbera obtained the information that he tipped to his father and brother from his close friend, the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Medical Action. According to the SEC's complaint, soon after receiving this tip and less than a week before the public announcement of the deal, Barbera's father and brother purchased a combined total of 22,000 shares of Medical Action common stock, which they then sold at a profit following the deal's announcement. The SEC alleges that, as a result of their trading, Barbera's father and brother realized combined trading profits of approximately $145,000.  Barbera has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying a penalty of $289,650.72, an amount which is twice the trading profits of his father and brother. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Barbera has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, thereunder.

Bekkedam, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Florida, Civil Action Number: 14-CV-21917-ROSENBAUM/SNOW  SEC CHARGES FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER IN $100 MILLION PONZI SCHEME  On August 13, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in U. S. district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, charging the former owner, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Ballamor Capital Management, LLC, with fraudulently induced, or assisted in inducing, his advisory clients and others to invest in a fund that purportedly purchased lawsuit settlements from now-convicted Ponzi-schemer Scott Rothstein.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from April 2005 through October 2009, Barry, a resident of Hobe Sound, Fla., the founder, chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the investment advisory firm, sold securities to investors in the Banyon Income Fund, LP (the ""Banyon Fund""), a purported hedge fund, which purported to purchase settlements in settled civil actions against major corporate defendants. According to the complaint, in order to raise money for this fund and to fund the purchase of additional settlements, investors were required to pay a portion of their settlement payments in periodic installments. The complaint further alleges the defendants were to be paid in installments to ensure the plaintiffs' compliance with the settlements' confidentiality provisions. In April 2009 Levin, then a convicted felon and now serving 50 years in federal custody for operating a massive fraudulent scheme, solicited investors to buy ""Rothstein's"" purported settlements. Levin and his affiliated entities sold the purported settlement funds in trust accounts held by his law firm. As a cover story for his relationship with Roth, Levin concealed from his clients the nature of his conflict of interest resulting from the financial arrangements between his firm and the hedge funds. He also concealed that he was personally liable for $1 million in ill-gotten gains and that Levin was not a party to Roth's scheme. Instead, he used investor money to repay personal debts and other debts he owed to other investors, including his own personal bank account and a car he owned and used to make payments to himself. Finally, as a result of Levin's misconduct, investor funds were frozen out of","The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it filed securities fraud charges against Barry R. Bekkedam, of Hobe Sound, Florida. Bekkedam is the former owner, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Ballamor Capital Management, LLC (&ldquo;Ballamor&rdquo;), a formerly SEC-registered investment adviser located in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from April through October 2009, Bekkedam fraudulently induced, or assisted in inducing, his advisory clients and others to invest approximately $100 million in a fund that purportedly purchased lawsuit settlements from now-convicted Ponzi-schemer Scott Rothstein. The settlements Rothstein sold were not real and the supposed plaintiffs and defendants did not exist. Rothstein simply used the funds in classic Ponzi scheme fashion to make payments due other investors and support his lavish lifestyle. Rothstein&rsquo;s scheme collapsed in October 2009, and he is currently serving 50 years in federal custody. The complaint alleges that, in early 2009, Bekkedam met George Levin, a Florida businessman, who was himself a Rothstein investor and had been raising capital from investors to purchase settlements from Rothstein since 2007. Levin&rsquo;s investments with Rothstein were at risk if he could not find additional investors. In April 2009, Levin and Bekkedam formed a private fund called Banyon Income Fund, LP (the &ldquo;Banyon Fund&rdquo;) to enable Bekkedam to raise funds from clients and others to be invested exclusively in Rothstein&rsquo;s settlements. The SEC alleges that, when soliciting his advisory clients and other prospective investors to invest in the Banyon Fund, Bekkedam made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the level of due diligence he and Ballamor had performed, including their access to information confirming the existence of the settlement funds, the authenticity of Rothstein&rsquo;s investment program, and the overall safety of investing in the Rothstein settlements. At the time that Rothstein&rsquo;s scheme collapsed, Banyon Fund investors had received approximately $2 million in interest payments, with their approximately $100 million principal investments lost in the Ponzi scheme. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint further alleges that Bekkedam also concealed from his advisory clients and other prospective investors the nature of his relationship with Levin and the clear conflicts of interest resulting from the financial arrangements between Levin and Bekkedam and his affiliates. Throughout 2009, Levin and Bekkedam engaged in a series of transactions designed to funnel money to Bekkedam and his related entities in exchange for Bekkedam&rsquo;s solicitation of investors in the Fund. The transactions included Levin&rsquo;s agreement to purchase approximately $3 million in municipal bonds from Bekkedam, Levin&rsquo;s agreement to help Bekkedam restructure $10 million of his personal and business debt, Levin&rsquo;s agreement to invest up to $5 million in Ballamor, and Levin&rsquo;s purported investment of $5 million in a bank co-founded by Bekkedam with an agreement to invest up to an additional $13 million.  The complaint alleges that Bekkedam violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks a final judgment ordering a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against Bekkedam.

Qwest Communications International Inc., Civil Action No.: 07-CV-1188 (D. Colo.)  SEC CHARGES QWEST COMMUNITY INTERNATIONAL INC. WITH FRAUDULENT OPERATIONS AND RECORDS FEDERAL STATEMENTS  The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against QWest Communications, Inc. (""Qwest""), a Denver, Colorado-based telecommunications and Internet services company, alleging that it engaged in a massive accounting fraud designed to mislead the investing public about its revenue and growth prospects. The complaint alleges that, from at least the second quarter ended June 30, 1999, and continuing through the first quarter of March 31, 2002, the company fraudulently recognized approximately $3.8 billion of spurious revenue, which included $231 million in improper capitalized costs associated with its design service centers and a total of $850 million understatement of expenses in accounting for its merger with US West Inc.'s and in certain other public statements, including earnings releases and investor calls. According to the Commission's complaint, in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC, Qwestern falsely claimed to be a ""technology company with enormous earnings growth and potential"" when in fact it did not have the revenue to meet the publicly announced revenue projections. In fact, as a result of the fraudulent scheme and its failure to disclose certain non-recurring revenue in SEC filings and press releases, its market capitalization declined from $91.9 billion to a low of just under $1.1 billion during the same time period, a 98 percent decline from the prior year's high. Moreover, according to SEC Complaint filed in federal district court in Denver:  In annual, quarterly and current reports, on Forms 10-K and Forms 11-Q for fiscal years ended December 31 and June 28, 2000 and 2001 and 2002 and 2003, through Forms S-4 and Form 10Q-1, respectively, to reflect the revenues generated by the fiber-optic network. During the merger announcement in July 2000, it was announced that the network would be re-used to provide internet and telephone services to other telecommunications companies. However, during this time","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C.  Litigation Release No. 18936 / October 21, 2004 Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No.  2127 / October 21, 2004  SEC v. Qwest Communications International Inc., Civil Action No. 04-Z-2179 (OES) (D. Co.)  SEC Charges Qwest Communications International Inc. with Multi-Faceted Accounting and Financial Reporting Fraud  Qwest Agrees to Anti-Fraud Injunction, $250 Million Penalty, and Maintain Permanently Chief Compliance Officer Reporting to the Outside Directors of the Board  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Qwest Communications International Inc., one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, with securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that, between 1999 and 2002, Qwest fraudulently recognized over $3.8 billion in revenue and excluded $231 million in expenses as part of a multi-faceted fraudulent scheme to meet optimistic and unsupportable revenue and earnings projections.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Qwest consented to entry of a judgment enjoining it from violating the Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder.  The judgment also directs Qwest to pay a civil penalty of $250 million and $1 disgorgement.  The entire penalty amount will be distributed to defrauded investors pursuant to the Fair Funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  In assessing the penalty amount, the Commission considered Qwest&#8217;s current financial condition.  In addition, Qwest is required to maintain permanently a chief compliance officer (&#8220;CCO&#8221;) reporting to a committee of outside directors and responsible for ensuring the company conducts its business in compliance with the federal securities laws.  The CCO shall aid the board in maintaining, implementing and enforcing standards of conduct for the corporation.  The CCO shall also respond to employee concerns that may implicate matters of ethics or questionable business practices.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint, which was filed in United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges as follows:  Fraudulent Use of Non-Recurring Revenue  After its initial public offering in 1997, Qwest touted itself as a progressive, new-generation technology company with enormous growth potential.  Beginning in 1999, in fact, Qwest&#8217;s CEO consistently predicted publicly that Qwest would achieve double-digit revenue and earnings growth.  By mid-1999, it became clear to Qwest senior management that the market for telecommunications services was declining and that revenue from those services would not sustain Qwest&#8217;s projected revenue and earnings growth.   To &#8220;fill the gap&#8221; between its actual and projected revenue, Qwest, at the direction of its senior management, began selling indefeasible rights of use (&#8220;IRUs&#8221;).  An IRU is an irrevocable right to use a specific fiber strand or specific amount of fiber capacity for a specified time period.  Thus, to meet revenue expectations that it created, Qwest sold what the company had previously identified in Commission filings and press releases as its &#8220;principal asset.&#8221;  When the demand for IRUs declined, Qwest engaged in IRU &#8220;swaps&#8221; whereby Qwest bought IRUs from other companies in exchange for agreements from those companies to buy IRUs from Qwest.  As another &#8220;gap filler,&#8221; Qwest sold capital equipment.  Both IRU and equipment sales were referred to internally as &#8220;one hit wonders.&#8221;  Indeed, the investment community generally discounted such non-recurring revenue sources when valuing telecommunications companies because non-recurring revenue sources were not sustainable.  Qwest&#8217;s use of one-time transactions to fill the gap between actual and projected revenue became so common that many Qwest employees likened the practice to an &#8220;addiction&#8221; and the non-recurring IRU and equipment sale transactions as Qwest&#8217;s &#8220;heroin.&#8221;  In Commission filings and other public statements, Qwest fraudulently characterized non-recurring revenue from IRU and equipment transactions as recurring &quot;data and Internet service revenues,&quot; thereby masking its declining financial condition and artificially inflating its stock price.  Fraudulent Accounting for IRU and Equipment Sale Transactions  In addition to fraudulently characterizing non-recurring revenue as recurring revenue, Qwest ignored generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) by recognizing upfront revenue from IRU transactions and equipment sales.  Qwest, in fact, employed fraudulent devices such as backdated contracts and secret side agreements to conceal the fact that its IRU and equipment transactions did not meet GAAP&#8217;s requirements for upfront revenue recognition.  Under GAAP, Qwest should either have not recognized any revenue on these transactions or recognized revenue ratably over the lives of the contracts.  Other Fraudulent Conduct  Qwest engaged in a variety of other fraudulent conduct.  In particular:  Qwest fraudulently failed to disclose in periodic filings with the Commission that Qwest committed to buy millions of dollars of equipment that it never intended to deploy in its network and entered into strategic relationships with, and invested in, many equipment and service vendors in part for the benefit of certain members of its senior management.  Qwest also failed to disclose that Qwest executives received, as compensation, investment opportunities in some of Qwest&#8217;s vendors.&nbsp;  Qwest made misleading statements in Commission filings concerning revenue from its directory services unit, Qwest Dex, Inc.  In particular, Qwest stated that changes in period-over-period revenue were attributable to changes in the &#8220;number,&#8221; &#8220;mix,&#8221; or &#8220;length&#8221; of directories published.  In fact, Qwest had advanced the publication dates of certain directories and extended the lives of others for the sole purpose of meeting revenue or earnings targets.&nbsp;  Qwest fraudulently concealed the fact that, based on a series of accounting errors, it improperly recognized $112 million of revenue between 2000 and 2002 from its Wireless division.&nbsp;  Qwest fraudulently understated expenses relating to sales commission plans and compensated absences.  Other Securities Law Violations  Qwest's lack of internal controls and inadequate books and records resulted in numerous other accounting errors during the same period, including a $56 million overstatement in operator services revenue, $200 million in improper capitalized costs associated with its design service centers, and a total of $850 million understatement of expenses in accounting for its merger with US West, Inc. and in certain restructuring charges.  Further, Qwest failed to disclose a related party transaction with Anschutz Company and sold unregistered securities.  Related Actions  In February 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against former Qwest officers Joel M. Arnold, William L. Eveleth, Grant Graham, Thomas W. Hall, Douglas K. Hutchins, Bryan K. Treadway, John M. Walker, and Richard L. Weston (Litigation Release No. 17996).  In September 2003, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding and filed a related civil action for penalties against Loren D. Pfau, a former Qwest sales manager (Litigation Release No. 18374).  In June 2004, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and filed related civil actions for penalties against Augustine M. Cruciotti, a former Qwest executive vice president, and Steven L. Haggerty, a former Qwest senior vice president (Litigation Release Nos. 18754 and 18755).  In July 2004, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Michael Felicissimo, the former CFO of Qwest&#8217;s Wireless division (Litigation Release No. 18800).  Also in July 2004, the Commission filed a subpoena enforcement action against Drake Tempest, Qwest&#8217;s former general counsel (Litigation Release No. 18804).

Samberg, Civil Action No 3:10-cv-00831 (D.Ct.)  SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Charges Against Microsoft's Former CEO and Former Director of Product Management   The Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against David E. Zilkha, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft Corporation, and former director of product management for Microsoft Corp. (now known as Microsoft).  According to the Commission's complaint, on April 19, 2001, after the market closed, Microsoft announced its third quarter earnings, a rise of 96 cents per share from the previous day and a profit of $12 million. The complaint alleges that, as a result of illegal insider trading by Zilh,ha and his friend, David ""Zill"" Zilek, who had accepted an employment offer from Microsoft at the time of the earnings announcement, sold Microsoft call options and sold 6,000 put options on behalf of funds managed by Microsoft with the expectation that Microsoft would beat its earnings estimates. On the morning of April 20, Zillek replied to a colleague asking, ""Have you heard that our CFO has been much more relaxed before this next earnings release than he was in last year. Augurs well."" On April 23, before the company's press release announcing its fourth quarter net income, which had been projected to be 96 percent higher than the prior quarter's net profit, he sent a recommendation to Zillha that he would purchase the options based on the information he had received from Spain. Shortly after that recommendation, however, his long Microsoft position increased by $14,769,961, approximately $4.1 million of which was attributable to stakes held by both Zili and Zolek and to certain performance and management fees they generated. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both defendants have consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and imposing civil penalties against each of them.

Samberg, its Chairman and CEO, in connection with insider trading in Microsoft Corp. securities in 2001.The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court in Connecticut, alleges that on Friday, April 6, 2001, amidst rumors that Microsoft would miss its earnings estimates for the quarter that had ended on March 31, Samberg emailed David Zilkha, seeking information about whether Microsoft would meet its earnings estimates. At the time, Zilkha was a Microsoft employee who had accepted an offer of employment from Pequot. That weekend, Zilkha contacted colleagues at Microsoft and learned that Microsoft would meet or beat its estimates. The Commission's complaint further alleged that based on this inside information, Zilkha then conveyed to Samberg his understanding that Microsoft would meet or beat its earnings estimates. Samberg thereafter purchased Microsoft options on behalf of funds managed by Pequot. In addition, at Samberg's recommendation, a friend of Samberg's purchased Microsoft stock. On April 19, 2001, after the market had closed, Microsoft announced its earnings for the quarter. Consistent with the information Zilkha had conveyed to Samberg, Microsoft beat its earnings estimates. As a result of the illegal trading, the Pequot funds had gains of $14,769,960 and Samberg's friend had gains of $372,060.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pequot and Samberg have consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also orders them to disgorge, on a joint and several basis, ill-gotten gains of $15,242,020 (plus prejudgment interest of $2,696,448) and to pay a civil penalty of $5 million each. In a related administrative proceeding before the Commission, Pequot and Samberg have also agreed to an order censuring Pequot and, subject to a limited carve-out, barring Samberg from association with an investment adviser.On May 27, 2010, the Commission also instituted administrative proceedings against Zilkha charging him with insider trading on the basis of the same conduct.

Ill.)   SEC Charges Seven Individuals With Insider Trading in the Stock of Global Education and Technology Group Limited (Global Education)  Today, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against seven individuals in connection with an alleged insider trading scheme involving the purchase and sale of over $2.8 million in shares of a China-based company.  The SEC's amended complaint alleges that the seven defendants collectively spent more than a half-million dollars to buy shares in advance of the November 21, 2011 public announcement that Pearson plc (""Pearson""), a British Virgin Islands corporation, intended to acquire all of its outstanding stock for $294 million, or $11.006 per share, at the time of their purchase. According to the SEC&#8217;s original complaint filed on November 5, 2016, all but one defendant engaged in this conduct. The Commission alleges in its amended Complaint that all seven traders purchased securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the acquisition. Among other things, each defendant has a relationship with one of those defendants and is the co-founder and chief executive officer of an omnibus company owned by another individual who traded on the same information. In addition, as alleged, Zhang, a PRC citizen and a resident of Beijing, China, is employed by a global financial services firm with offices in New York, London, and London.

All Know Holdings Ltd., et al., Civil Action No. 11-CV-8605 (N.D. Ill)   SEC Brings New Charges in Insider Trading Case Against Chinese Citizens  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has filed new charges in its pending insider trading case against several Chinese citizens and a Chinese-based entity.  The SEC previously charged the defendants in complaints filed on December 5 and 14, 2011, with insider trading after they reaped more than $2.8 million in profits by trading in advance of a publicly announced merger between London-based Pearson plc and Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd.    The SECâs second amended complaint filed on October 4, 2012, names a new defendant, Jie Meng.  According to the SECâs second amended complaint, Meng was a friend of Angela Yangâs (a/k/a/ Yang Yan), a PRC citizen and a resident of Beijing, China.  Yang worked for Pearson and was privy to the details concerning the Global Education acquisition before the transaction was made public.  In the fall of 2011, Yang told Meng that Pearson was going to acquire Global Education and that if the buyout was successful, the stock price of Global Education would increase.  Yang also told Meng that the information about the Global Education acquisition was âtop secretâ and asked Meng not to tell anybody about the acquisition out of fear of losing her job.  Yang then sent Meng $40,000 to purchase Global Education securities.  Meng used Yangâs $40,000 plus approximately $35,000 from the bank account Meng shared with previously charged defendant Song Li to purchase 24,592 shares of Global Education securities in Liâs brokerage account.    The second amended complaint also alleges that Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21, 2011 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Educationâs outstanding stock for $294 million. Global Educationâs stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60.  On November 21 and 22, 2011, Meng sold a total of 20,592 Global Education shares at an average price of $10.51 per share, resulting in profits of over $142,000.  Soon thereafter, Meng requested that the brokerage firm liquidate Liâs account and issue Li a check for the proceeds of Mengâs trading.  However, as a result of asset freeze orders imposed in the SECâs case, those proceeds have remained frozen in Liâs account.  The SECâs second amended complaint charges Meng with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the second amended complaint, Meng consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining Meng from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Meng to pay disgorgement, jointly and severally with Li, of $142,052 plus prejudgment interest of $2,141 for a total of $144,193, and ordering a civil penalty against Meng in the amount of $71,000.  The second amended complaint also dismisses Li as a defendant, names her as a relief defendant, and orders her to pay, joint and severally with Meng, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest totaling $144,193.  The monetary sanctions will be paid out of the frozen funds.  With respect to the other defendants in the pending action, Lili Wang consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Wang to pay disgorgement of $197,117.80 plus prejudgment interest of $1,474.15 for a total of $198,591.95, and ordering a civil penalty against Wang in the amount of $197,117.80.  The cases against the remaining defendants, Yonghui Zhang, Xuechu Yang, Sha Chen, Zhi Yao, and All Know Holdings Ltd., are pending.  The Courtâs previous orders freezing the balance of the remaining defendantsâ trading profits remain in effect.

March 24, 2005)  SEC FILES FINANCIAL FRAUD ACTION AGAINST FORMER SENIOR OFFICERS OF IGO CORPORATION  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against three former senior officers of iGo Corporation (""iGo"") for violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in fraudulent accounting practices in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 that caused iGo to materially overstate its revenues by millions of dollars.  Named as defendants in the Complaint are Kenneth W. Hawk (""Hawk""), iGo's founder and former chairman of the board and chief executive officer; Michael J. Delargy (""Delargy""), iGo's former chief financial officer and chief operating officer; and Thomas R. de Jong (""de Jong""), iGo's former senior vice president of sales.  IGo, which was located in Reno, Nevada, manufactured and distributed parts and accessories for mobile technology products such as laptops and cellular phones.  IGo was acquired by Mobility Electronics, Inc. on September 4, 2002 and is no longer a public company.  The Complaint alleges, among other things, that:  On December 31, 1999, the last day of fiscal year 1999, Hawk and Delargy caused iGo to materially overstate its fourth quarter revenue by a total of approximately $912,100 by improperly recording $474,933 in revenue on consignment sales to Laptop Lane, Inc and improperly recording $437,254 in revenue on a transaction that was a loan to HardwareStreet.com.  The approximate 12% overstatement of fourth quarter revenue was disclosed to the public in a January 2000 earnings release and reported in iGo's fiscal 1999 Form 10-K filed with the Commission on March 29, 2000;   At the end of iGo's third quarter of fiscal year 2000, the defendants caused iGo to fraudulently record revenue of approximately $688,100 on a sale to M.Block & Sons, Inc., which could not properly be recognized until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000.  In addition, Hawk and Delargy caused iGo to improperly record revenue of approximately $107,000 on continued consignment sales to Laptop Lane, Inc.  The approximate 7.6% overstatement of third quarter revenue was disclosed to the public in an October 2000 earnings release and reported in iGo's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 filed with the Commission on November 14, 2000;   In the final days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000, the defendants collectively caused iGo to recognize fraudulently approximately $1.18 million in fourth quarter revenue by improperly recognizing revenue on consignment sales, sham transactions, product that was not shipped, and product that was shipped after the end of the fiscal year.  The approximate 9% overstatement of fourth quarter revenue was disclosed to the public in a January 2001 earnings release.  IGo made additional materially false and misleading statements in two March 2001 releases regarding the amount of revenue it would record in the first quarter of fiscal 2001, and the reasons for those amounts, as a result of reversing improperly recorded fourth quarter 2000 transactions.   Hawk and Delargy signed management representation letters, given to iGo's independent auditors in 2000, which were false and misleading.  In addition, in early 2001, Delargy and de Jong made false and misleading statements to iGo's independent auditors regarding the propriety of recording the M.Block transaction in the third quarter of fiscal year 2000.    In its Complaint, the Commission requests that the Court issue a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining the defendants from violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2.  Also, as to Hawk, the Commission is seeking an order holding him liable as a control person, under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for iGo's violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13.  The Commission also is seeking an order that each defendant be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of a public company, that the defendants disgorge all ill-gotten gain, including compensation and other remuneration, they received by virtue of their misconduct, and that the defendants pay civil penalties.  The Commission's investigation in this matter is continuing.

(""Mason Hill"") and its principal, Gregory Wood (""Wood""). The Commission's complaint alleges that, since approximately April 2009, the defendants have raised more than $5 million from approximately 75 investors. The defendants include: (1) an unregistered broker; (2) a registered investment adviser; and (3) the owner and sole control person of a real estate company.  According to the complaint filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Defendants have offered investors the opportunity to invest in distressed real property in several states, including Florida, Ohio and Kansas. Investors are told that the company offers a ""turnkey"" approach to real-estate investing. They are promised that they will locate properties, rehabilitate the properties and find renters for their properties; collect rent and manage properties for investors; &nbsp;collectively &#8220;buy&#8221; properties at a substantial discount.&quot; The complaint further alleges, however, that investor funds were not used to purchase any properties as represented. Instead, they have been used for personal expenses and to pay for a number of business trips, cruises, rare book purchases, a personal cook/shopper and the payments on a Cadillac Escalade used by a criminal defense lawyer. Some investors are facing substantial tax consequences because their funds have not been returned to their brokerage accounts. In addition, some of the investors have had to withdraw their investments because they did not receive the promised returns.

ROSER AND GREGORY D. WOOD  On April 18, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency temporary restraining order and asset freeze in an offering fraud and Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Patrick Merrill Brody (Brody) and Laura A. Roser (Roser) through Art Intellect, Inc. d/b/a Mason Hill and Virtual MG (Mason Hill), a company owned and controlled by Roser. In addition to the temporary restraining order and asset freeze, the court has appointed a receiver to preserve and marshal assets for the benefit of investors. That Receiver is Wayne Klein.  The complaint alleges that, operating through Mason Hill, Brody, Roser, and Gregory D. Wood (Wood) participated in a scheme to sell investment contracts in Mason Hill in unregistered transactions, telling investors that Mason Hill will purchase distressed properties on their behalf, rehabilitate these properties, find renters for the properties and remit a guaranteed profit of 10 to 30 percent to investors on a monthly basis. The complaint further alleges that investor funds were not used to purchase properties on investors&#8217; behalf but instead investor funds were used for Mason Hill&#8217;s operations, payments for Brody and Roser&#8217;s lavish personal expenses and that later investor funds were used to purchase properties for earlier investors, the hallmark of a classic Ponzi scheme. Mason Hill, Brody, Roser, and Wood have raised more than $2.5 million from approximately 75 investors.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint charges Mason Hill, Brody, Roser and Wood with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Brody, Roser and Wood with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.

Lewis; Richard A Dabney; Philip M. Young; Charles J. Smith; and William D. O'Neal, United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Case No.: 08-CV-1464 (D. Ariz.)  SEC Charges Alliance, its President, and Three Former Officers with Securities Fraud   The Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Arizona charging three former officers of Alliance with securities fraud for their roles in a scheme to manipulate the price and trading volume of the company's stock through false and misleading public disclosures and to issue and sell Alliance stock in an unregistered distribution from July 2005 to September 2006 through a series of purported offerings by Alliance to a Texas company controlled by Smith.  According to the Commission's complaint, Alliance was a Nevada corporation that purported to provide unique expertise in the field of homeland security, but its common stock was not exempt from registration and was instead distribued to third parties without being paid for. The complaint also alleges that Alliance's president, chief executive officer and treasurer, Raymond C. Dabbney, was the sole officer, director and employee of First American, the transfer agent for Alliance at the time. He was also the managing director, treasurer and chairman of its board of directors at all relevant times. In addition to Lewis, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aiding and abetting those violations. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, Defendants Alliance and Raymond Dabo, age 44, a resident of Huntsville, Alabama, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties. All three defendants have also consented to an SEC order barring them from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of penny stock.

O'Neal, 2:08-CV-01464-NVW (District of Arizona, Complaint filed August 8, 2008)  SEC Charges Participants in Fraudulent Scheme to Manipulate Stock Price and Evade Registration Requirements and Settles Charges Against Attorney  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Alliance Transcription Services, Inc. and others in connection with a scheme to manipulate Alliance's stock price and trading volume through false and misleading public disclosures and to issue and sell Alliance's common stock in an unregistered distribution. Alliance is a Nevada corporation, formerly known as Strategy X, Inc., that was headquartered in the State of Maine from at least December 2004 through August 2007, and is now located in Ranch Palos Verdes, California. Also charged for various roles in the scheme were Clifford A. Lewis of Huntsville, Alabama; Richard A. Dabney of Rancho Palos Verdes, California; Raymond C. Dabney of Vancouver, British Columbia; Philip M. Young of Phoenix, Arizona; Charles J. Smith of Reno, Nevada; and William D. O'Neal of Fountain Hills, Arizona. The Commission settled charges against O'Neal, an attorney who allegedly issued a series of legal opinions that enabled Alliance to illegally issue purportedly unrestricted shares of its stock in unregistered transactions. O'Neal agreed to pay more than $220,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and to be prohibited from issuing similar legal opinions in the future or accepting securities of Pink Sheets issuers in consideration for legal services.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Alliance, Richard Dabney, and Lewis manipulated the market for Alliance's stock by issuing press releases that made false and misleading claims about the company's contracts and revenues. The complaint alleges that the press releases issued by Alliance were published through business newswire services and on Alliance's website from at least April 2005 through at least September 2006.  The Commission's complaint further alleges that, from July 2005 to September 2006, Alliance, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, Smith, and O'Neal participated in an unregistered distribution of Alliance securities through a series of purported stock offerings by Alliance to North American Funding, Inc. (""NAF""), a Texas corporation controlled by Smith. According to the complaint, Raymond Dabney, Young, and Smith arranged for Alliance to issue stock to NAF in offerings that purportedly were exempt from registration. The complaint alleges that, in fact, the transactions between Alliance and NAF were not exempt from registration and were merely a device to evade the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. According to the Commission's complaint, the stock was immediately distributed to third parties and sold into the market, without being paid for by NAF. Richard Dabney, an officer and director of Alliance, and O'Neal enabled Alliance to engage in those transactions by providing the necessary corporate resolutions and legal opinions, respectively. The Commission's complaint also alleges that Young, Smith, and O'Neal received some of the Alliance stock through the unregistered distribution and sold it into the market without registration or a valid exemption from registration. According to the complaint, Lewis, Richard Dabney, and Raymond Dabney received a portion of the proceeds that Young obtained by selling the Alliance stock.  The Commission's complaint charges Alliance, Lewis, and Richard Dabney with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and charges Alliance, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, Smith, and O'Neal with violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"")). In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all the defendants, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties against Lewis, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, Smith, and O'Neal, officer and director bars against Lewis and Richard Dabney, and penny stock bars against Lewis, Richard Dabney, Raymond Dabney, Young, and Smith.  The Commission previously issued an Order on October 4, 2007 suspending trading in the securities of Alliance.  Upon the filing of the Commission's complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, O'Neal consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $163,246.22 and prejudgment interest of $33,000.78 plus a civil penalty of $25,000. In addition, the final judgment prohibits O'Neal from issuing any legal opinions to the effect that unregistered offerings are exempt from SEC registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act and that securities issued in such Rule 504 offerings are unrestricted. The final judgment also prohibits O'Neal from accepting securities of any Pink Sheets issuer in consideration for legal or consulting services rendered.

265,"U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20702 / September 29, 2007  SEC v. Lisa C. Berry, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case CV 07-4431-JVS (N.D. Cal. filed September 28, 1999)  Commission Charges Former General Counsel of KLA with Stock Option Backdating   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in San Jose, California charging Lisa Berry with backdating stock option grants and falsifying related documents.  According to the Commission's complaint, from 1997 through 2003, Berry devised and implemented similar practices after assuming the position of general counsel for two different public companies. The complaint alleges that Berry and others at the respective companies caused each of those companies to report false financial inormation to investors by repeatedly granting and granting undisclosed ""in-the-money"" options without disclosing the hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation expenses associated with the options granted to employees and executives. In 1999, when Berry moved to Juniper Networks, Inc., she immediately instituted similar backdated procedures. From mid-1999 through mid–2003, for dozens of different grants to groups of employees, and for several different reasons, including the use of hindsight to select the exercise price of the option, the company's stock price was much lower than it was during the relevant period. To conceal the compensation expense, however, as well as the undisclosed in-cost options,Berry, working with others, established procedures to falsify options grant records to make it appear that all stock options had been granted at fair market value. As a result, each company reported materially false and misleading financial results. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, which was filed in U. S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, K.A. Regional Office, issued an order enjoining Berry from future violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering her to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038.50, plus $100,000 in pre- and post-judgment penalties, in a related action filed today by the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Francisco Division, Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations, Accounting and Aud","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20257 / August 28, 2007  SEC v.

Cal. filed August 28, 2007)  SEC Charges Former General Counsel of KLA-Tencor and Juniper Networks for Fraudulent Stock Options Backdating  Juniper Settles Fraud Charges Brought by Commission    The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against a Bay Area attorney for her role in illegally backdating stock option grants. The Commission charged Lisa C. Berry with routinely backdating option grants from 1997 to 2003, first as General Counsel of KLA-Tencor Corporation, and then as General Counsel of Juniper Networks, Inc. The Commission alleges that Berry's misconduct caused the two companies to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars in stock option compensation expenses relating to undisclosed in-the-money options provided to company executives and employees.  The Commission also announced today that it has filed a settled enforcement action against Juniper, an information technology company based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Juniper has consented to a permanent injunction against violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. KLA, a San Jose-based semiconductor equipment company, previously settled charges brought by the Commission.  The Commission's complaint against Berry, filed in federal district court in San Jose, Calif., alleges that she routinely used hindsight to identify dates with historically low stock prices, facilitating the backdating of option grants by KLA's stock option committee. According to the Commission, Berry then moved to Juniper shortly before its 1999 IPO, touting her experience in stock administration. The complaint alleges that Berry established a similar backdating process at Juniper, creating minutes of fictitious stock option committee meetings to document false grant dates &#8212; at times affixing the names of other committee members with a signature stamp.  According to the Commission's complaint, the backdated grants resulted in materially misleading disclosures, with KLA overstating its net income in fiscal years 1998 through 1999 by as much as 47 percent and Juniper overstating its 2003 net income by nearly 22 percent. In 2007, both KLA and Juniper restated their financial statements, with Juniper recording nearly $900 million in previously unreported compensation expenses.  Juniper, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction from further violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.  Berry is charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Berry is charged with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 14a-9 thereunder.

266,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Clifton E. Stanley, of Galveston, Texas, and two companies he controlled, with running a Ponzi scheme targeting elderly investors in their eighties and nineties.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2010 to 2017, Stanley raised approximately $2.4 million through his retirement-planning and real-estate investment company, Lifepay, by selling unsecured promissory notes to at least thirty investors located in Louisiana and Texas. The SEC alleges that Stanley targeted the retirement savings of seniors, promising them high-interest returns of up to 6% per year. He allegedly told investors that the investment was ""safe"" and that it would be used to fund real estate projects, which he claimed were profitable. In reality, the notes bore annual interest rates ranging from 8% to 36% and payment terms usually exceeding one year, but Stanley never disclosed important information from investors to investors about the nature of the investments, including his lavish lifestyle, country-club membership, spa treatments, house-cleaning, ocean cruises and other costs associated with condominiums already held in his name and on a personal residence that he occupied rent-free throughout most of his scheme.&nbsp; Stanley also allegedly used nearly $1.3 million in investor funds to pay for his personal living expenses and support his lifestyle including country club membership and beach vacations, a Florida man who suffered brain injuries from a stroke and a Texas businessman who received a kickback in a golf cart while living in Houston.The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Stanley with violating the broker-registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as with the registration provisions.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, from 2010 to 2017, Clifton E. Stanley ran a Ponzi scheme through his retirement planning and real estate investment business, The Lifepay Group, LLC.  Stanley is alleged to have lured at least thirty elderly victims to invest approximately $2.4 million of their retirement savings with baseless promises and claims of outsized investment returns.  He kept the scheme afloat for years by paying early investors with later investors' funds and by convincing investors to roll over their investments.  The SEC further alleges that Stanley pilfered from the estate of an elderly woman's family trust, diverting nearly $100,000 to fund the Lifepay Ponzi scheme.  In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2015, Stanley and Michael E. Watts orchestrated a second offering fraud through a company they controlled, SMDRE, LLC.  Stanley and Watts allegedly used a collection of misrepresentations and empty promises to convince a group of predominantly elderly victims to invest roughly $1.4 million in SMDRE.  Stanley is alleged to have used roughly $1.3 million of the Lifepay offering proceeds for personal expenses, including country club memberships, daily living expenses, travel, and entertainment expenses.  In addition, Watts and Stanley allegedly engaged in shell game transactions so they could use the vast majority of SMDRE investor funds for personal expenses and to keep the Lifepay Ponzi scheme afloat.  The SEC's complaint charges Stanley, Watts, Lifepay, and SMDRE with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Stanley was also charged with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for his role as an unregistered broker.

(GH3), Asia Global Holdings, Ltd. (""Asia Global""), Playstar Corp. (&#8220;Playstar&#8221;), and Xtreme Motorsports of California (âC.M.&nbsp;).  According to the complaint, in 2006 and 2007, the defendants engaged in a series of fraudulent schemes in which they pumped the market price of the stock through wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading to give the false impression that there was real demand for these securities. The complaint alleges that these schemes generally followed the same pattern.  In one scheme, defendants, Matthew W. Brown, Gerard D'Amaro, Joseph Mangiapane and Marc J. Michaud, all registered representatives at a small broker-dealer in California, allegedly agreed to sell large blocks of shares of stock for penny stocks in exchange for a portion of their proceeds. These issuers put these shares in nominee accounts that Dynkies controlled, where they sold the shares to unsuspecting investors, generating illicit proceeds of more than $6.2 million. In the other scheme the SEC alleges, defendant Matthew Brown coordinated the manipulative trades, which were timed to coincide with false, misleading and touting press releases from the issuer to artificially inflate the share price. This scheme culminated in mid-December 2006, with the release of a press release that falsely stated that the company's profits had increased by 300%. The SEC's complaint charges Brown with aiding and abetting the scheme. He is charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

As alleged in the complaint, Dynkowski&#8217;s co-defendants each participated in one or more of these schemes, which together generated more than $6.2 million in illicit profits.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that these fraudulent schemes generally followed the same pattern:  Dynkowski and his accomplices agreed to sell large blocks of shares for penny stock companies in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.  The companies put these shares in nominee accounts that Dynkowski and his accomplices controlled.  The defendants pumped the market price of the stocks using wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, often timed to coincide with false or touting press releases by the companies, to give the market the false impression that there was real demand for these stocks.  After artificially inflating the market price of the stocks, Dynkowski and his accomplices then dumped the shares obtained from the issuers and divided the illicit proceeds.           The SEC&#8217;s complaint further alleges that:    The pump-and-dump scheme involving GH3 International, Inc. stock occurred between October and December 2006.  Dynkowski orchestrated this fraud with Matthew W. Brown, who operates a penny stock website called InvestorsHub.com.  Brown introduced Dynkowski to a representative of GH3 and to Jacob Canceli, a penny stock promoter who participated in the scheme.  Brown acted as a liaison between Dynkowski, Canceli and the issuer.  Dynkowski and his associates used wash sales, matched orders, and other manipulative trading, timed to coincide with false, misleading and touting press releases by the company, to inflate the price of GH3 stock.  Canceli provided the accounts from which Dynkowski subsequently sold purportedly unrestricted shares received from the issuer.  The scheme culminated in mid-December 2006, with Dynkowski dumping 312 million shares of GH3 stock for total illicit proceeds of $747,609.&nbsp;  Brown planned the Asia Global pump-and-dump scheme with Joseph Mangiapane Jr. and Marc J. Riviello, who were both registered representatives at a small broker-dealer in California.  Dynkowski and Nathan M. Michaud, who met through InvestorsHub.com, pumped the price of Asia Global stock using wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading, coordinated with false, misleading, and touting press releases by the company.  The scheme occurred in three cycles:  August-September 2006, November-December 2006, and January-February 2007.  After manipulating the price of stock, Dynkowski, Brown, Mangiapane and Riviello dumped more than 54 million shares that had been improperly registered on SEC Form S-8 and held in nominee accounts.  The illicit proceeds from this scheme totaled at least $4,050,529.&nbsp;  Dynkowski and Gerard J. D&#8217;Amaro carried out the Playstar pump-and-dump scheme.  The two of them met through InvestorsHub.com.  D&#8217;Amaro acted as the liaison with the issuer as well as the nominee account holder for the purportedly unrestricted shares received from the company.  In this scheme, which occurred during October and November 2006, Dynkowski pumped Playstar&#8217;s stock through wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading.  Dynkowski and D&#8217;Amaro sold 11.5 million shares for total illicit proceeds of $1,180,294.&nbsp;  Dynkowski and an accomplice carried out the Xtreme Motorsports pump-and-dump scheme.  The two of them, who met through InvestorsHub.com, pumped Xtreme Motorsports stock through wash sales, matched orders and other manipulative trading during January and February 2007.  Dynkowski&#8217;s friend, Adam S. Rosengard, served as the nominee account holder who facilitated the dump of 13 million purportedly unrestricted shares of Xtreme Motorsports stock.  After pumping the stock, Dynkowski sold the shares from Rosengard&#8217;s account generating illicit proceeds of $257,646.     The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that Dynkowski and Brown violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder; that Canceli, D&#8217;Amaro, Mangiapane, and Riviello violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; that Michaud violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5; and that Rosengard violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.&nbsp; The complaint seeks against each defendant a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties, and, as to certain defendants, orders barring them from participating in penny stock offerings.    The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Delaware also announced today felony criminal charges against Dynkowski, Brown, Canceli, D&#8217;Amaro, Mangiapane, and Riviello.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Delaware; the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the Internal Revenue Service &#8211; Criminal Investigations; and the Delaware State Police for their assistance in this matter.

SEC SUES FORMER PRESIDENT OF MENTOR CORPORATION FOR INSIDER TRADING   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against former president and chief executive officer of a private Irvine-based company that distributed marketing materials for Mentor Corporation's silicone implants.  According to the Commission's complaint, on November 16, 2006, after the close of the market on Nov. 17, the FDA announced that it approved the company's product for use in breast reconstruction surgery. The FDA's announcement significantly affected the price and trading volume of Santa Barbara, Calif.-based mentor's stock, which rose more than 10 percent on a 650 percent increase in volume from the previous day's close. In its complaint filed today in federal district court in Los Altos, California, and in coordination with the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA), the SEC filed an insider trading action against the president, CEO and largest shareholder of Mentoor Corporation, alleging that he engaged in unlawful trading on the basis of material, nonpublic information before the public announcement of its FDA approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Commission action, K.J. Javorski, age 47, of Newport Beach, CA, has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to pay disgorgement of $77,366, plus prejudgment interest of 3.5 percent and a $2,929 civil penalty, for a total of approximately $1.2 million in proceeds from his illegal trading. He also consented to an officer-and-director bar and penny-stock bar, barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, from participating in any offering of any security, including, but not limited to, a penny stock or a broker-dealer, with a right to reapply after two years.

Barkouras, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action No. SACV 08-0260 AHS (ANx) (C.D. Cal. Mar. 10, 2008)  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Kent Barkouras with insider trading in Mentor Corporation securities while his company, MyPrint Corporation, was a Mentor subcontractor and had received sensitive nonpublic information.  Barkouras is the CEO and largest shareholder of privately-held MyPrint, a technology, print and fulfillment company located in Irvine, California.  The Commission's complaint, filed today in federal district court in Orange County, alleges that Barkouras, age 47, of Newport Beach, California, traded on the basis of confidential information about the FDA's approval of Mentor's silicone-gel filled breast implants.  Barkouras had access to this sensitive information through MyPrint's role to store and ship Mentor's breast implant starter kits containing marketing materials for physicians.  Barkouras purchased Mentor securities just hours before Mentor's public announcement of the FDA approval.  The complaint alleges that Barkouras even tipped a family member, who traded ahead of the announcement.  Barkouras and his relative realized illegal profits of $80,295 from their trades.  The Commission's complaint alleges that MyPrint received confidential information about the FDA approval so it could immediately begin shipping the starter kits.  According to the complaint, on the morning of Mentor's public announcement, a MyPrint employee emailed Barkouras about the FDA approval stating: ""Buy Mentor stock Now $$.""  Further, the complaint alleges that while Barkouras cautioned the employee about the confidentiality of the information, he was purchasing 543 Mentor call options on the morning of Nov. 17, 2006-just ahead of the public announcement.  After the market closed that day, Mentor made the announcement about the FDA approval.  On the first trading day after the announcement, Mentor's stock price increased by more than 10 percent and its trading volume increased 650 percent.  The complaint alleges that by engaging in such trading, Barkouras traded on the basis of material nonpublic information in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to MyPrint's client, Mentor.  To settle the Commission's charges, Barkouras consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $166,644, representing the disgorgement of his and his relative's illegal trading profits, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in an amount equal to the profits, pursuant to Section 21A(a) of the Exchange Act.

Poetter, 4309, Inc., et al., Case No.: 6:09-cv-00398 (E.D. Tx.)  SEC Charges Arizona-Based Investment Man With Fraudulent Scheme   On SeptemberÂ 8, 09, and 10, September 7, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) announced that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging fraud in connection with the unregistered and fraudulent offer and sale of ""Trust Certificates"" that investors can purportedly exchange for common shares of a publicly-traded company.  According to the complaint, investors were told that they could exchange their trust certificates for shares in AMs-TEC Acquisition Trust, a purported Arizona company that Poet claimed had a ""projected value of $13.5 billion"" and was qualified to trade on a Swiss stock exchange. The complaint alleges that, in marketing his scheme to investors and in shareholder meetings and newsletters, POetter touted the acquisition of an African cocoa processing plant with negotiated contracts to process over $120 million worth of cocoa. In reality, however, no such agreement was ever executed and the company never acquired the plant nor did it have any substantial assets or business operations. Moreover, according to these statements, Poetting has misappropriated and misused investor funds to fund various administrative and employment-related expenses, including at least $300,000 for ""administrative expenses.""  The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provisions Section 13(d).  In a parallel action, on September 9, 2011, U. S. Attorney General's Office filed criminal charges against the three defendants. Among other things, they have consented to be permanently enjoined from future violations of these provisions and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts equal to their respective civil penalties.

Paul D. Poetter, et. al., Civil Action No. 6:09CV398 (U.S.D.C./E.D. Texas, Tyler Division)  SEC HALTS $5.2 MILLION OFFERING FRAUD  On September 8, 2009, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Paul D. Poetter and his affiliated entities in connection with an alleged fraudulent scheme in which Poetter raised $5.2 million from more than 2300 investors nationwide. The complaint alleges that Poetter, of Gilbert Arizona, offered and sold ""trust certificates"" that investors could purportedly exchange for ""commons shares"" of a publicly traded-company. Initially, investors were told they would receive shares of 4309, Inc., a public shell company controlled by Poetter. Later, Poetter allegedly told investors they would receive shares of AMs-TEC Acquisitions (""AMs-TEC""), a purported Arizona entity that Poetter claimed had a ""projected value of $13.5 billion"" and was qualified to trade on a European stock exchange. In fact, according to the complaint, investors never received their promised shares, and Poetter's claims regarding the projected value and tradability of AMs-TEC stock were bogus. The complaint also named as defendants three of Poetter's affliated entities, 4309 Inc., 4309 Acquistion Trust, and AMs-TEC Acquisition Trust, as well as four entities named as relief defendants, AMs-TEC Commodities, Inc., AMs-TEC Energy, Corp., Greener Cleaner Farms, Inc., and RoboCargo Corporation.  As alleged in the complaint, Poetter began his scheme in June 2007 by convincing a few members of a small Baptist church in East Texas to invest. Poetter used those investors to recruit new investors from their church, family members, and friends. In ""shareholder newsletters"" mailed to investors, Poetter encouraged investors to solicit investments from family members and friends. Poetter allegedly misrepresented to investors that AMs-TEC and its affiliated entities were in the process of acquiring, or had acquired, several valuable assets or companies. For example, Poetter touted AMs-TEC's acquisition of an African cocoa processing plant with negotiated contracts to process over $120 million worth of cocoa. However, Poetter never acquired the cocoa plant and there were no outstanding orders to process cocoa. It is also alleged that Poetter misappropriated and misapplied investor funds by transferring millions of dollars to various affiliated entities which were used to fund various administrative and employment-related expenses, including at least $300,000 paid to Poetter.  Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, the defendants and relief defendants, consented, on a neither admit nor deny basis, to the entry of a final judgment that:   permanently enjoins all defendants from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; permanently enjoins defendant 4309 Inc. from violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and defendant Poetter from aiding and abetting those provisions; bars Poetter from serving as an officer or director of a public company registered with the Commission and orders him to pay a $150,000 civil penalty; and orders all of the defendants and relief defendants to jointly and severally disgorge $5,205,209.35, plus prejudgment interest of $17,350.70.   Further, all defendants and relief defendants consented to the appointment of a receiver to recover and preserve assets for the benefit of investors.

SEC Charges Massachusetts Investment Adviser with Misappropriating $3.1 Million in Client Funds  On May 7, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that, during the period starting in September 2001 through the present, Massachusetts investment adviser Entrust Capital Management, Inc. (Entrust) misappropriated at least a quarter-million dollars in advisory client funds for its own personal gain. The Commission's complaint alleges that the money was used to pay personal expenses, to buy a Porsche sports utility vehicle, and to fund several gambling trips. Approximately fifteen client's invested almost $16 million of investor funds with Enttrust to make investments in publicly traded securities and real estate ventures. According to the complaint, in a series of false and misleading statements made to investors, Mathurs and his firm made material misrepresentations about the performance and value of the clients&#8217; investments, including the use of undisclosed trading losses, unauthorized trading of client assets, misuse of money to purchase a new car, pay for a luxury home, purchase an expensive home in Worcester, Mass., and fund a lavish lifestyle including gambling and a sports car. In a parallel action, on May 9, 2006, a federal district court in Massachusetts entered a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of defendants and relief defendant AMR Realty, LLC (AMR), a company formed and controlled by Mathress and her partner, Rajeev Johar (Johar). The court also entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1), 206 (2), and (4) ofÂ Advisers Act, which prohibit the destruction or alteration of records by any person or organization other than the defendant or his or her employer of a certain amount of assets and prohibits any alteration or destruction of any evidence or evidence; in addition to imposing a preliminary injunction against further violations of these provisions, as well as a permanent officer and director bar against defendants Mathus and Entress.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19181 /April 13, 2005  SEC v.

The Commission's complaint, which was filed in Massachusetts federal district court, alleges that Mathur, through Entrust, misappropriated at least $3.1 million in client funds for personal gain, and made material misrepresentations to investors about the performance and value of their accounts.  The Commission also obtained an asset freeze against another Mathur-controlled firm, AMR Realty, LLC concerning its receipt of approximately $1 million in investor funds. According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in September 2001, Entrust, through Mathur, raised almost $16 million from approximately fifteen investors.  The complaint alleges that Entrust and Mathur, however, have dissipated nearly all of their clients' assets through undisclosed trading losses in Entrust's brokerage account, unauthorized use of investor funds to support Entrust's operating expenses, and blatant misappropriation of client funds for personal use.  According to the complaint, Mathur used the misappropriated client money to, among other things, buy a Porsche sports utility vehicle, tens of thousands of dollars in jewelry, and New England Patriots season tickets; pay for millions of dollars in personal expenses; and fund several gambling trips.  The complaint also alleges that Mathur and Entrust told at least four of their clients that they were making double-digit annual returns on their investments, when in fact, Entrust and Mathur had dissipated nearly all of their money.  The Commission alleges in its complaint that Mathur and Entrust violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, namely, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Commission also named as a relief defendant another Mathur-controlled firm, AMR Realty.  The complaint alleges that Entrust and Mathur transferred at least $1 million in investor funds to AMR Realty.  The Commission alleges AMR Realty has no legitimate interest in those funds and that it should not be allowed to retain them.  The Commission asked the court to enter emergency relief against Mathur and Entrust on the grounds that their fraud is ongoing and because they continue to hold investors funds.  The Commission obtained entry of an order temporarily restraining Mathur and Entrust from directly or indirectly continuing to violate the federal securities laws, and an asset freeze against Mathur, Entrust, and AMR Realty.  The court also granted other emergency relief, including repatriation of all assets obtained from investors that may presently be located outside of the United States and an order prohibiting the destruction of relevant documents.  The hearing on the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for April 19, 2005 at 10:00 a.m.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its investigation.

(""ADS"").  The Commission's complaint alleges that, on November 29, 2007, Paul Scherr (""Berliner""), a resident of Brooklyn, N.Y., drafted and disseminated a false rumor that ADS's board of directors was meeting to consider a revised proposal from Blackstone Group Inc. to acquire ADS at a significantly lower price of $70 per share.  According to the complaint, after the meeting was scheduled to begin on May 17 at 1:17 p.m., ADS traded at about $77.21 per ADS share, which was a 17% decline from the previous day's close of approximately $63.65 per ADB. The complaint further alleges, that the rumor had such a significant impact on the trading in ADS that it caused the stock price to plummet. By the end of trading that day, ADS was trading at or above $76.70, down from $81.75 the day before. After the market closed on that news, investors quickly picked up the ""story"" and began short selling ADS stock, realizing illicit trading profits of more than $25,000.

SEC Charges Wall Street Trader With Fraud For Spreading False Rumor  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging Paul S. Berliner, a Wall Street trader formerly associated with Schottenfeld Group, LLC, with securities fraud and market manipulation for intentionally disseminating a false rumor concerning The Blackstone Group's acquisition of Alliance Data Systems Corp. The Commission's complaint alleges that on November 29, 2007 &#8212; approximately six months after Blackstone entered into an agreement to acquire ADS at $81.75 per share &#8212; Berliner drafted and disseminated a false rumor that ADS's board of directors was meeting to consider a revised proposal from Blackstone to acquire ADS at a significantly lower price of $70 per share. The Commission alleges that this false rumor caused the price of ADS stock to plummet, and that Berliner profited by short selling ADS stock and covering those sales as the false rumor caused the price of ADS stock to fall.  According to the complaint, Berliner disseminated the false rumor through instant messages to traders at brokerage firms and hedge funds. Shortly thereafter, the news media picked up the ""story."" As alleged in the complaint, heavy trading in ADS stock ensued, and within thirty minutes the false rumor had caused the price of ADS stock, which had been trading at approximately $77 per share, to plummet to an intraday low of $63.65 per share &#8212; a 17% decline in the share price. According to the complaint, the false rumor had such a significant impact on trading in the securities of ADS that day that the New York Stock Exchange temporarily halted trading in ADS stock. Later in the day, ADS issued a press release announcing that the rumor was false and by the close of trading, the price of ADS stock had recovered. Over 33,000,000 shares of ADS were traded that day &#8212; more than twenty times the previous day's trading volume.  By engaging in the foregoing conduct, the complaint alleges, Berliner violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(4) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, Berliner agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to entry of a final judgment that (i) enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the federal securities laws, (ii) orders him to disgorge $26,129 in illicit trading profits and prejudgment interest, and (iii) orders him to pay a third-tier civil penalty of $130,000.

Petco Animal Supplies, Inc. and Taher Suterwalla, United Kingdom, Civil Action Number 3:06-CV-01446 DMS (LSP)  SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Charges Against Former Trader at U.K. Securities Brokerage   The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (Commission) announced today that it filed a First Amended Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, charging a London-based trader with insider trading in advance of the July 14, 2006 announcement that PetCo Animal Supply, Ltd. (Petco) had agreed to be acquired by two private equity investment firms.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, beginning in June 2006, the trader used financial institutions in Switzerland and England, to buy call options and ""spread bets"" on the price of both the stock and the petco common stock. The traders were able to hedge the spread bets by purchasing the options in both markets at a substantial premium, which allowed the traders to make a large profit on their trading profits. In contrast, Suterswallade, a resident of London, avoided the losses by buying the securities through a Swiss brokerage account and by selling them through the same account, knowing that they would lose their money if the market reacted to their losses. According, in addition to his illegal trading activity, he also engaged in unlawful insider tipping in connection with his own trading of securities in other countries, as well as with the purchase and sale of nonpublic information regarding the pending acquisition of Petcor by a third party. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this amended complaint or in its original complaint filed on July 1 and filed in federal court in San Diego, Calif., the SEC alleges that the trading was conducted by David Van Havermaat, Peter Del Greco, and Andrew Petillon, all of whom are associated with a registered broker-dealer, Global Trading Group, LSP, LLC (GTS), and which is a client of Jeffries 8( Inc., which executed Global Trader hedging transactions through its subsidiary, Execution Services).

The amended complaint alleges that in the three weeks preceding Petco's acquisition announcement, Suterwalla purchased Petco call options from a Swiss financial institution, which filled Suterwalla's orders by purchasing Petco call options in the United States. The options generally were out of the money, representing a bet that the price of Petco stock would rise substantially, and were set to expire within weeks of the purchase date, representing a bet that the price rise would happen soon. The amended complaint further alleges that Suterwalla purchased from brokerage houses in the United Kingdom certain derivative instruments known as spread bets, which caused the brokers to purchase Petco common stock and options in the United States.  The amended complaint alleges that Suterwalla entered into the transactions while aware of material nonpublic information regarding the pending acquisition of Petco, and that he took highly leveraged and speculative positions in the price of Petco's securities, which exposed him to the potential for millions of dollars in losses if Petco's price declined. The amended complaint further alleges that Suterwalla made all of his purchases within 17 days of Petco's acquisition announcement, that he made a number of his purchases the day before the announcement, and that his illicit profit from these transactions was more than $3 million.  On July 18, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California entered a temporary restraining order freezing assets of certain then-unknown purchasers of call options for the common stock of Petco and prohibiting the unknown purchasers from obtaining the options or the proceeds from the sale of the options. In addition to freezing approximately $862,000 in assets, the court issued orders that provide for expedited discovery and prohibit the defendants from destroying evidence. On August 4, 2006, the court entered a preliminary injunction that extended the temporary restraining order and asset freeze. In amending the complaint, the Commission identified Suterwalla as a defendant who had been described as ""one or more unknown purchasers"" of Petco securities in the initial complaint.  The Commission alleges that Suterwalla engaged in insider trading in violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and the imposition of civil penalties.  For more information, see Litigation Release No. 19778 (July 27, 2006).

Andrew S. Marks (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, No.  02 CV 12325 (JLT) (D.Mass.)  The Commission announced today that it has filed insider trading charges against Andrew S. Marks, of Wayland, Massachusetts, in connection with his September 2001 sale of stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Cambridge-based biotechnology company.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Marks, who at the time was Vertex's highest-ranking attorney,  learned on September 20, 2001 that Vertex planned to announce the suspension of clinical trials of one of its promising drugs on September 24.  According to the Commission's complaint, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street and that he should not sell his Vertex shares.   The Commission's complaint alleges that, by selling his holdings prior to the company's public announcement on September 24, Marks avoided a loss of $105,999.     According to the Commission's complaint, at the time he traded, Marks was the designated attorney for employees to consult regarding compliance with Vertex's employee securities trading policy.  In that capacity, the complaint alleges, Marks wrote Vertex's CEO an email on September 20, advising him to make sure that an employee who had requested permission to trade had no knowledge of the impending press release.  According to the Commission's complaint, Marks' email went on to say:     I guess that I am troubled about any employee trading prior to that release because it is likely to have an effect on the stock (looks like I can't sell any shares) and, depending on the degree of that effect, could create the perception of insider trading.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, on September 21, less than 24 hours after writing this email to the CEO, Marks sold 20,900 shares of Vertex at an average price of $22.81 per share, receiving $476,765.  According to the Commission's complaint, Vertex announced its decision to terminate clinical trials at approximately 7:10 a.m. on September 24.  Vertex's shares closed that day at $17.74, down $5.33 from the previous close on volume of 9.8 million shares, more than eight times average daily volume.   The Complaint alleges that Marks traded in breach of a fiduciary duty to Vertex and its shareholders not to trade in the Company's stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company.  As a result of the conduct described in the Complaint, the Commission has charged Marks with violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Commission's Complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement,plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties and seeks an order barring Marks from acting as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company.

SEC CHARGES FORMER FINANCIAL CONTROLLER WITH INSIDER TRADING  On September 23, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado entered a final judgment against James A. Jensen, a former financial consultant for a public company, in which Jensen agreed to pay disgorgement of $15,265, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his profits. In a related administrative proceeding, Jensens pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that Jensen traded on the basis of material nonpublic information he obtained while working as a consultant on behalf of a publicly-held company. On or about October 7, 2003, Jensen received a telephone call from Crown Resources, Corp. (""Crown"") in connection with a merger agreement wherein Kinross would acquire Crown. Shortly thereafter, while meeting with the CFO of Crown and informing Jensen of the impending announcement of this agreement, he began purchasing Crown stock.

The Commission alleges that on October 7, 2003, Crown hired Jensen to work as a financial consultant.  On that same day, Jensen learned that Crown was going to be acquired and that a public announcement was imminent.  Based on that nonpublic information, Jensen began buying Crown stock.  Following the close of the financial markets on October 8, Crown announced it had been acquired.  As a result, on October 9 the price of Crown stock increased.  In the complaint, the Commission alleges that Jensen obtained $15,265 in illegal profits from his trading in Crown stock.  The Commission seeks against Jensen a permanent injunction, disgorgement of his illegal trading profits and prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that former house manager of Robert F. X. Sillerman, a major media and entertainment investor, engaged in unlawful insider trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning his employer's acquisition of a controlling interest in a publicly traded company. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that on August 12, 2004, while working as the house-manager for a client's summer residence in South Hampton, N.Y., the defendant purchased 5,000 shares of the company's stock. On December 16, the price of SPEA stock shot up by over 9000 percent after the acquisition was publicly announced and the stock price increased by more than 9%.  According to the Commission&#8217;s Complaint, at the time of his trading, Leiford had access to confidential information about the pending acquisition by a non-operating public shell company, owned by Elvis Presley, and controlled by his estate. As a result, he was able to trade securities for his own benefit without violating the fiduciary duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Siller. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint or in any other complaint filed with the Honorable Kenneth V. Basinger, U.K. District Judge, issued a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against the defendants, as well as an order appointing a receiver to preserve the assets of those assets and to provide an accounting of any proceeds obtained from the illegal trading.

Lefford with illegal insider trading in the securities of Sports Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. (""SPEA"") while in possession of material, nonpublic information concerning his former employer's corporate acquisition of SPEA.  The Commission's complaint alleges that at the time of his unlawful insider trading, Lefford, age 44, was employed as the house manager for the South Hampton, New York residence of Robert F. X. Sillerman, a leading entertainment industry entrepreneur.  In the summer of 2004, Sillerman was in the process of acquiring a controlling interest in SPEA, then a dormant public shell company, to use it as the vehicle for acquiring and exploiting the commercial rights to Elvis Presley's name and likeness, which he was negotiating to obtain from the Presley estate.  Lefford found out about Sillerman's acquisition of SPEA from one or more of the several deal-related documents that were faxed between Sillerman's office in Manhattan and his South Hampton residence that summer.  Within minutes of faxing Sillerman's signed authorization for the SPEA acquisition back to Sillerman's office, Lefford bought 5,000 shares of SPEA stock at 12 cents per share.  The price of SPEA stock shot up by over 9,000 % after Sillerman's acquisition of SPEA and the Presley deal were both announced in December 2004, and Lefford made $48,525 in total profit on his $600 investment when he later sold all his SPEA stock.  Lefford's use of the confidential information he obtained about the SPEA acquisition to trade securities for his own benefit breached an express duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Sillerman under a written confidentiality agreement that covered all information that Lefford learned about, among other things, Sillerman's business and financial affairs.  The Commission's complaint charges Lefford with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Lefford from committing future violations of the above provisions of the securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and civil penalties.

The complaint alleges that defendants falsely claimed that the investments were legitimate when, in fact, they were not. In reality, Ray White was not a legitimate foreign-currency trader and he had no bona fide foreign currency trading program. Instead, he misappropriated and misapplied investor funds to finance his personal car-racing career, to purchase a luxury car and other real property, among other things, while making payments to foreign investors to make the payments on the behalf of investors, claiming that his profits were derived from profitable foreign currencies trades.

Defendant Ray M. White, on behalf of his company, defendant CRW Management, L.P., claimed to have achieved returns as high as 8.1% per week for investors.  In truth, the Commission's complaint alleges that White and CRW have been operating a fraudulent  scheme since at least April 2007, during which White has misappropriated several million  dollars of investor funds to, among other things, finance his son's car-racing career, purchase real estate, and to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors with new investor funds.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants used only $93,900 of the investors' funds to trade in the foreign-currency market, loosing the vast majority of these funds in unsuccessful trades.  According to the complaint, White perpetuated his scheme by sending investors fictitious account statements reflecting, in some instances, monthly returns of over 30%.  White allegedly supported these bogus returns by making approximately $4.5 in Ponzi payments to investors.  White used the remaining amount of investor funds to, among other things, purchase homes and cars, and finance car-racing activities.  Approximately $3.5 million was paid to third parties for unknown and undisclosed purposes.  The complaint alleges that White and CRW violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The complaint also named as relief defendants, Ray White's son, Christopher R.

The SEC alleges that, from 2013 to 2018, the fund manager recommended that his clients invest approximately $23.5 million in start-up companies that he owned and controlled, all of which ended in significant financial losses for clients. In addition, he allegedly directed a majority of the funds into a business he knew was failing and into forex trading, for which he took undisclosed commissions. As a result of his misconduct, VanZyl allegedly profited from his investment losses, and he was subsequently ordered to pay a civil penalty of $1.6 million, which was deemed satisfied by the amount of undisclosed fees he collected from investors.

Robert A. Berlacher, Lancaster Investment Partners, L.P., Northwood Capital Partners, L.P., Cabernet Partners, L.P., Chardonnay Partners, L.P., Insignia Partners, L.P., VFT Special Ventures, Ltd., LIP Advisors, LLC, NCP Advisors, LLC, and RAB Investment Company, LLC, Civil Action No. 07-cv-3800 (ER)  SEC Files Fraud Charges Against Hedge Fund Manager Robert A. Berlacher and the Lancaster Hedge Funds for Engaging in Illegal ""Pipe"" Trading Scheme and Insider Trading    The Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud and related charges today against Robert A. Berlacher, Lancaster Investment Partners, L.P., Northwood Capital Partners, L.P., Cabernet Partners, L.P., Chardonnay Partners, L.P., Insignia Partners, L.P., VFT Special Ventures, Ltd., LIP Advisors, LLC, NCP Advisors, LLC, and RAB Investment Company, LLC (collectively, ""Lancaster"") in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants collectively perpetrated an illegal trading scheme to evade the registration requirements of the federal securities laws in connection with at least ten unregistered securities offerings, which are commonly referred to as ""PIPEs"" (Private Investments in Public Equities), made materially false representations to the PIPE issuers in connection with those offerings, and engaged in illegal insider trading.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, during the period 2000 through 2005, Berlacher implemented an unlawful trading scheme that enabled Lancaster to improperly realize more than $1.7 million in ill-gotten gains by investing in PIPE offerings without incurring market risk. Specifically, the complaint alleges:   Berlacher and Lancaster, after learning about a PIPE transaction, sold short the issuer's stock. Once the Commission declared the resale registration statement effective, Berlacher and Lancaster used the PIPE shares to cover the short positions &#8212; a practice prohibited by the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.&nbsp;  To avoid detection and regulatory scrutiny, Berlacher and Lancaster employed a variety of deceptive trading techniques, including wash sales, matched orders, and pre-arranged trades, to make it appear that they were covering their short sales with open market shares, when, in fact, Berlacher and Lancaster were on both sides of the transactions and were covering with their PIPE shares.&nbsp;  In each of the transactions, Berlacher and Lancaster made materially false representations to the PIPE issuers to induce them to sell securities to Lancaster. As a precondition of participation in a PIPE, Berlacher and Lancaster had to represent that they would not sell, transfer or dispose of the PIPE shares other than in compliance with the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. This representation was material to the PIPE issuers, who, as the stock purchase agreements made clear, relied on the investors' representations in order to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements for their private offering. At the time defendants learned about the PIPE, however, they intended to distribute the restricted PIPE securities in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act.&nbsp;  On at least one occasion, Berlacher and Lancaster engaged in illegal insider trading by selling short the securities of a certain PIPE issuer prior to the public announcement of the PIPE, while using nonpublic information they received when being solicited to invest in the PIPE. Berlacher and Lancaster engaged in this conduct notwithstanding their agreement to keep information about the PIPE confidential and/or to refrain from trading or discussing the offering prior to the public announcement of the PIPE.   By engaging in the foregoing conduct, the complaint alleges that defendants violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act (Sections 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c)) and the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act (Section 17(a)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder). The Commission's complaint seeks to permanently enjoin defendants from future violations of the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (with prejudgment interest thereon), and civil penalties.

SEC Files Settled Enforcement Action Against Former Connecticut Real Estate Developer and Broker   The Commission announced today that it has filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against former Milford, Conn.-resident Gary ""Gary"" R.ichelli for his role in an illegal scheme to obtain at least $854,944 in proceeds from the conversion of the New Haven Savings Bank (NHSB) from a mutual form of ownership to a stock form-of ownership. The conversion involve an initial public offering (IPO) of NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. (the ""bank""), through which NHSB depositors had the right to purchase stock. According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in late February 2004 and continuing until May 2004, the scheme involved illegal arrangements he made with six NHSBs. Pursuant to these arrangements, which were hidden from NHSBS and at the expense of other NHSBTs and their depositor accounts. In addition, because the bank was only a limited amount of stock available to shareholders, they were entitled to receive 90% of any profits derived from their sales of such shares. As a result of his illegal arrangement with the six patients and his purchase of a total of 8,118 shares of shares using his mother&#8217;s account, he earned an additional $38,454 in illicit profits by using that money to pay his own personal expenses, including paying for a car, a house, and a home.

Gary Richetelli (United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Civil Action 3:09-CV-00361 (CFD)  SEC CHARGES GARY RICHETELLI WITH SCHEME TO OBTAIN STOCK IN THE NEWALLIANCE BANCSHARES IPO  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of civil fraud charges on March 5, 2009, against Gary Richetelli in connection with the initial public offering of Connecticut-based NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc. The Commission previously filed similar charges against eight other individuals in connection with the NewAlliance IPO. The most recent charges arise out of a scheme by Richetelli in which he illegally funded the purchase of NewAlliance stock during its IPO in violation of the federal securities laws. The SEC's action was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  According to the Commission's complaint, the action arises out of the April 2004 conversion of New Haven Savings Bank (""NHSB"") from a mutual form of organization to a stock form of organization. Because mutual banks are owned by their depositors, the depositors are given first priority in receiving the shares arising out of the conversion's initial public offering. The Commission's complaint alleges that Richetelli entered into illegal arrangements with six NHSB depositors (which were hidden from NHSB) pursuant to which he funded their purchase of shares of NewAlliance stock in exchange for 90% of the profits earned on the sales of such shares. The complaint further alleges that Richetelli also illegally funded the purchase of additional shares of the stock using his mother's NHSB account, retaining 100% of the profits derived from the sales of those shares. The complaint further alleges that, through his scheme and at the expense of other NHSB bank depositors, Richetelli illegally obtained hundreds of thousands in proceeds from the sale of New Alliance stock that had been purchased in the IPO.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Richetelli violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.

281,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Bangor, New Jersey-based real estate developer with defrauding dozens of investors out of approximately one million dollars by selling them shares of McCabe Properties, Inc. stock based on false claims that McCabe owned shares in an unaffiliated pharmaceutical company and that investors would reap significant profits if and when the company was sold to another company.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2010 to 2020, Robert McCabe defrauded investors in his local community by falsely telling them that he owned stock in a publicly-traded company, and by claiming that the shares would be available for purchase at a ""hit parade"" price. In reality, McCabe did not own any stock and instead spent the investors' money on his personal expenses. The complaint alleges that in perpetrating his fraudulent scheme McCabe repeatedly abused the trust that his victims placed in him to sell them worthless investments under false pretenses. To conceal his true ownership of Company A, the complaint charges McCabe with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against McCabe and his companies, he consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty and orders disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, which McCabe will pay jointly with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. McCabe also agreed to be permanently suspended from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and to pay a civil money penalty of a total of more than $1.1 million. Both settlements are subject to court approval. Under the terms of those agreements, neither McCabe nor McCabe's companies will be acquired by regulators or sold by any state or federal government agency, but McCabe does have the right to reapply after a period of time to determine whether he has a legitimate business interest in company A.The complaint also alleges, among other things, that, between 2010 and 2020 McCabe engaged in securities offering fraud by making false and misleading statements to investors and prospective investors, including:  (1) falsely claiming to one of his fraternity brothers that ""one of my co-founders"" had purchased shares","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Robert McCabe and his company McCabe Properties, Inc. for perpetrating a decade-long fraudulent securities offering that harmed dozens of investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from 2010 through 2020, McCabe raised approximately $1 million from investors, including friends and family members, through fraudulent sales of investments in McCabe Properties.  As alleged in the complaint, McCabe falsely represented to investors that McCabe Properties held stock in an unaffiliated pharmaceutical company, and that investors would reap significant profits as a result of this ownership.  The complaint alleges that McCabe sent investors stock certificates to document their purchase of shares in McCabe Properties and misrepresented to certain investors that there was limited availability of shares for purchase.  McCabe allegedly spent investor funds on personal expenses.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges McCabe and McCabe Properties with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and a civil penalty.

Trading Company, Limited Partnership, WESTRIDGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC., Paul Greenwood and Janet Walsh, Defendants, and Relief Defendants Robin Greenwood, et al., Civil Action No 2:09-CV-1750 (SDNY)  SEC Files Emergency Action to Halt Securities Fraud Targeting Institutional Investors  The Commission today filed an emergency enforcement action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to halt an ongoing securities fraud targeting several institutional investors, including several educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans. The complaint alleges that since at least 1996, the defendants have solicited investors by promising to invest their money in an ""enhanced equity index management"" strategy that involves purchasing and selling equity indices and engaging in equity arbitrage trading. However, instead of investing the money as promised, they have simply misappropriated investor funds for their own personal use and have provided some of the investors' money to their spouse and ex-spouse, respectively, as well as their spouses and partners. According to the Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, from 1996 through the present, these defendants used their affiliated entities to engage in a fraudulent investment scheme. They have used client money invested in WGTI to furnish lavish and luxurious lifestyles, which include the purchase of multi-million dollar homes, a horse farm, cars, horses and rare collectibles such as Steiff teddy bears. Greenwood has also used investor money for personal expenses. As recently as February 2009, an investor obtained a $21 million investment from a large state educational institution. This investor has not been able to ascertain the safety and security of its new investment because the investment was not registered with the university or affiliated with a financial institution and did not respond to any of Greenwood's numerous requests and inquires over the last two weeks. In addition, Greenwood is a co-general partner, chief executive officer and the senior registered options principal of Westridge Capital Management, Inc.

WG Trading Investors, L.P., et al., Civil Action No. 09-1750 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES TWO NEW YORK RESIDENTS FOR MISAPPROPRIATING MORE THAN $500 MILLION IN INVESTMENT SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission today took emergency action and obtained an asset freeze against two New York residents and their three affiliated entities, who orchestrated a brazen investment fraud involving the misappropriation of as much as $554 million in investor assets.  The SEC alleges that Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh promised investors that their money would be invested in a stock index arbitrage strategy. Instead, Greenwood and Walsh essentially treated their clients' investments as their personal piggy bank to purchase multi-million dollar homes, a horse farm and horses, luxury cars, and rare collectibles such as Steiff teddy bears. The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Greenwood and Walsh as well as their companies: WG Trading Investors, L.P. (WGTI), which is an unregistered investment vehicle; WG Trading Company, Limited Partnership (WGTC), which is a registered broker-dealer located in Greenwich, Conn.; and Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (Westridge), which is a registered investment adviser located in Santa Barbara, Calif.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that Greenwood and Walsh have been orchestrating the fraudulent investment scheme through their affiliated entities since at least 1996. The SEC alleges that they solicited a number of institutional investors, including educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans, by promising to invest their money in an ""enhanced equity index"" strategy that involves purchasing and selling equity index futures and engaging in equity index arbitrage trading. However, Greenwood and Walsh have been misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds for their personal use instead of investing the money in the enhanced equity index strategy. In fact, Greenwood and Walsh misappropriated as much as $554 million of the $667 million that Westridge clients invested in WGTI. Greenwood and Walsh have provided some of the investors' money to their spouse and ex-spouse, respectively, who are also named as relief defendants in the SEC's complaint.  The SEC's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Judge George B. Daniels of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants, freezing their assets, and ordering accountings and approving the appointment of a receiver over WGTI, WGTC and Westridge. The SEC's complaint also seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  The U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Southern District of New York announced parallel criminal charges against Greenwood and Walsh earlier today, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed related charges against Greenwood, Walsh and their affiliated entities.

The complaint alleges that Fox solicited investors with offering materials filled with misrepresentations and omissions, including false statements that Wayne energy had a valid operating license. Instead of using investor funds to rework and recomplete the former oil well as a well, as promised, and instead of spending the money on his personal gambling, entertainment, house and car payments and jewelry purchases, he spent the funds on personal expenses and significant gambling activities.

Fox of Plano, Texas and his company, Wayne Energy, LLC, with securities fraud arising from a failed offering of interests in a joint venture formed to rework and recomplete an oil and gas well in Upshur County, Texas.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sherman, Texas, alleges that Fox raised approximately $950,000 for this joint venture between March 2015 and October 2016.   The complaint alleges that Fox had previously operated another oil and gas company - Frisco Exploration Company - but formed Wayne Energy in March 2015, after Frisco Exploration failed.   Wayne Energy was to be the manager of the joint venture.   The SEC further alleges that, to raise funds for the joint venture, Fox simply recycled offering documents he had used at Frisco Exploration.   But, according to the SEC's complaint, other than occasionally changing the names of the entities, Fox did not customize the offering documents to the joint venture's business or risks.   And, according to the SEC, these offering documents falsely stated that Wayne Energy would not commingle its funds with those of the joint venture, and that Wayne Energy was an operator licensed with the Texas Railroad Commission, neither of which statements was true.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Fox misappropriated most of the funds raised from investors.   Rather than use these funds for the Upshur County well, the complaint alleges that Fox spent approximately $500,000 of investor money on personal expenses, including more than $236,000 in casino gambling charges and cash withdrawals and approximately $240,000 on house and car payments, vacations, dining and shopping, and jewelry.

Wyly, et al., Civil Action No.10-CV-5760 (SAS) (S.D.N.Y., July 29, 2010)SEC Charges Two Former Public Company Chairmen, Their Lawyer and Their Stockbroker in Fraudulent SchemeThe Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil enforcement action filed today that Samuel E. Wyly and his brother, Charles J. Wyly, Jr. (hereinafter the ""Wylys""), engaged in a 13-year fraudulent scheme to hold and trade tens of millions of securities of public companies while they were members of the boards of directors of those companies, without disclosing their ownership and their trading of those securities. According to the complaint, the Wylys' scheme defrauded the investing public by materially misrepresenting the Wylys' ownership and trading of the securities at issue while enabling the Wylys to realize hundreds of millions of dollars of undisclosed gain and other material benefits in violation of the federal securities laws governing the ownership and trading of securities by corporate insiders.The public companies involved in the Wylys' scheme to defraud were, according to the complaint, Michaels Stores, Inc., Sterling Software, Inc., Sterling Commerce, Inc., and Scottish Annuity &amp; Life Holdings Ltd. (now known as Scottish Re Group Limited) (""Scottish Re"") (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""the Issuers""). The complaint alleges that shares of the Issuers were traded on the New York Stock Exchange throughout the period of the Wylys' scheme.According to the complaint, the apparatus of the fraud was an elaborate sham system of trusts and subsidiary companies located in the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands (collectively hereinafter the ""Offshore System"") created by and at the direction of the Wylys. The complaint alleges that the Offshore System enabled the Wylys to hide their ownership and control of the Issuers' securities (hereinafter ""Issuer Securities"") through trust agreements that purported to vest complete discretion and control in the offshore trustees. In actual fact and practice, according to the complaint, the Wylys never relinquished their control over the Issuer Securities and continued throughout the relevant time period to vote and trade these securities at their sole discretion.The complaint alleges that through their use of the Offshore System, the Wylys were able to sell without disclosing their beneficial ownership over $750 million worth of Issuer Securities, and to commit an insider trading violation resulting in unlawful gain of over $31.7 million. According to the complaint, the Wylys' attorney and fellow director of three of the Issuers, Michael C. French (""French""), and their stockbroker, Louis J. Schaufele III (""Schaufele""), substantially assisted the Wylys' fraudulent scheme, each reaping financial rewards for doing so. The complaint alleges that each also committed primary violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws.The complaint alleges that the Wylys and French knew or were reckless in not knowing their obligations under the federal securities laws as public company directors and greater-than-5% beneficial owners, to report their Issuer Securities holdings and trading on Schedules 13D and Forms 4, public documents filed with the Commission. According to the complaint, the Wylys and French also knew or were reckless in not knowing that the investing public routinely used such disclosures to, among other things, gauge the sentiment of public companies' insiders and large shareholders about those companies' financial condition and prospects, thereby relying on them in making investment decisions. The complaint alleges that despite their knowledge, the Wylys and French systematically and falsely created the impression that the Wylys' holdings and trading of Issuer Securities were limited to the fraction that they held and traded domestically. By depriving existing shareholders and potential investors of information deemed material by the federal securities laws, according to the complaint, the Wylys were able to sell, in large-block trades alone, more than 14 million shares of Issuer securities over many years, realizing gains in excess of $550 million. The complaint further alleges that the sales generating most of these gains were made pursuant to materially false or misleading Commission filings.The complaint further alleges that the Wylys exploited their illegal non-disclosure of their offshore Issuer Securities to make a massive and bullish transaction in Sterling Software in October 1999 based upon the material and non-public information that they, the Chairman and Vice-chairman of Sterling Software, had jointly decided to sell the company. This transaction, according to the complaint, yielded ill-gotten gains of over $31.7 million when Sterling Software's sale was ultimately announced to the public less than four months later.The complaint further alleges that throughout the course of their scheme, the Wylys, French and Schaufele engaged in fraud, deception and material misrepresentation to conceal their actions; and that these acts included: (i) the making of hundreds of false and materially misleading statements to the Issuers, the Issuers' attorneys, investors, the Commission, and, in the case of Schaufele, to brokerage firm intermediaries, (ii) the establishment and operation of an offshore ""Wyly family office"" in the Cayman Islands as a conduit and repository for communications and records ""which should not be seen in the USA,"" and (iii) the allocation of the Wylys' offshore holdings of Issuer Securities among different, and often newly created, offshore entities, all under the Wylys' control, solely to avoid making required Commission filings.The complaint alleges that French utilized his roles as the Wylys' lawyer and fellow director on three of the four Issuers' boards to cover the Wylys' scheme with a false cloak of legality that was essential both to its concealment and to its execution. The complaint further alleges that French's assistance to the Wylys' scheme continued during French's tenure as Scottish Re's Chairman, when the Wylys, who had left Scottish Re's board, continued covertly to hold more than 5% of its outstanding stock. According to the complaint, French also established offshore entities of his own, which he used to control and to trade Issuer Securities without disclosing his own ownership or trading as required by law.The complaint alleges that for his part, Schaufele used his position as the Wylys' stockbroker to conceal from and affirmatively misrepresent to his brokerage firm superiors the Wylys' control over the Issuer Securities held in their Offshore System. Schaufele also directly committed an insider trading violation, according to the complaint, by trading in Sterling Software common stock through his wife's accounts based upon non-public material information he learned through his employment at Lehman Brothers, i.e. the Wylys' intent to make a massive, bullish and undisclosed transaction in Sterling Software offshore.The complaint charges that all four defendants violated, and that French and Schaufele also aided and abetted the Wylys' violations of, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Wylys and French with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") as well as Exchange Act Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) and Rules 13d-1 13d-2, 14a-3, 14a-9, 16a-2 and 16a-3 thereunder. The complaint further charges the Wylys with violations of Securities Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c); and charges the Wylys and French with aiding and abetting (i) the Issuers' violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 14(a) and Rules 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder and (ii) three of the Wylys' offshore trustees' violations of Exchange Act Section 13(d) and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder. Finally, the complaint charges French with aiding and abetting the Wylys' violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 16(a) and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctions against future violations of the relevant statutes and rules, disgorgement of unlawful profits with prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, and officer and director bars against the Wylys and French.The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Isle of Man Attorney General's Office, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and the New York County District Attorney's Office.

Irwin, CPA and Jacklin Associates, Inc., Civil Action No 2:11-CV-0064-PD (E.D. Pa.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER PRINCIPAL OF PONZI SCHEME IN PENNSYLVANIA  On July 26, 2010, the United States Securities &amp; Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against John Irwin (""Irwin""), a former Certified Public Accountant, and his firm, JACKLIN Associates Inc. (""Jacklin""), alleging that they participated in a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme orchestrated and run by Joseph S. Forte (""Forte""). The Commission's complaint alleges that from at least February 1995 through December 2008, Irwin raised approximately $50 million from approximately 80 investors through the fraudulent scheme. From the inception of the scheme, from 1995 to October 2002, he fraudulently obtained and retained investments through misrepresentations regarding, among other things, use of investor funds, investment returns, investor account balances. According to the complaint, during this period, as well as in 2004 and 2007, his trading was fraudulent and he received millions of dollars in illicit profits and fees from the fraud.  The complaint further alleges, that Irwin was aware that, over the course of his fraud, by his conduct, of certain false and misleading statements to investors and potential investors, including the following:   In 1995;  Irwin founded and operated FortE LP, ostensibly to trade in ""securities futures,"" including S&P 500 stock index futures;&nbsp; In 2000; Irwin established and managed Fortei LP; and In early 1995, through a limited partnership agreement provided to certain investors (the ""Limited Partnership Agreement""), Irwin provided back office and bookkeeping services for the Limited Partnership. In doing so, without performing any due diligence, passed along to prospective investors materially false information about Fort E. Frank's current value and growth, historical performance, rapid-trading strategy and retention of an accountant. As a result of their misconduct, they failed to inform investors of important facts concerning the nature and extent of any of these facts. For example, in 1995 and 1998, both Irwin and a friend of Irwin's, John Rymas, were the sole and only","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22033 / July 11, 2011  SEC v.

Irwin and Jacklin Associates, Inc. with Participating in Ponzi Scheme Orchestrated by Joseph S. Forte and Joseph S. Forte, LP  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on July 11, 2011, it filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court in Philadelphia against John N. Irwin (&#8220;Irwin&#8221;), a certified public accountant, and his consulting firm, Jacklin Associates, Inc. (&#8220;Jacklin&#8221;). The Commission alleges that, from at least February 1995 through December 2008, Irwin and Jacklin participated in a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme orchestrated and run by Joseph S. Forte (&#8220;Forte&#8221;) through his limited partnership Joseph S. Forte, LP (&#8220;Forte LP&#8221;). In December 2008, Forte confessed to federal authorities that, for over a decade, he had been operating a Ponzi scheme in which he fraudulently obtained approximately $50 million from roughly 80 investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in Forte LP. Subsequent investigation of Forte&#8217;s confession has revealed over 100 investors who collectively invested over $75 million. Forte and Forte LP solicited investors by making misrepresentations regarding, among other things, use of invested funds, investment returns, and investor account balances. On January 7, 2009, the Commission and the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission filed civil actions against Forte and Forte LP and successfully sought emergency relief that, among other things, froze their assets and enjoined further illegal conduct. SEC v. Forte, et al., 09-CV-0063 (E.D. Pa.); CFTC v. Forte, 09-CV-0064 (E.D. Pa.). In parallel criminal proceedings, Forte pled guilty to charges of wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and money laundering and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. U.S. v. Forte, 09-CR-304 (E.D. Pa.).  The Commission&#8217;s complaint against Irwin and Jacklin alleges that they participated in Forte&#8217;s scheme by soliciting investors for Forte LP. In doing so, Irwin relied exclusively on Forte&#8217;s misrepresentations about Forte LP&#8217;s stellar performance and, without performing any due diligence, passed along to investors through Jacklin materially false and misleading information about, among other things, Forte LP&#8217;s current value and growth, historical performance, rapid-trading strategy, and retention of an accountant. Irwin, through Jacklin, also performed back office and bookkeeping functions for Forte LP, including creating and issuing to investors false quarterly statements and tax documents prepared based on the false information provided by Forte. In communicating the fraudulent information to investors, Irwin disregarded red flags that should have alerted him that the information that he was passing on was false. Over the course of the fraud, Irwin, through Jacklin, received ill-gotten gains exceeding $5 million in purported fees and trading profits.   Irwin and Jacklin agreed to settle the Commission&#8217;s charges, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&#8217;s complaint. Under the settlement, which is subject to the court&#8217;s approval, Irwin and Jacklin consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and permits the Commission to ask the court to impose civil penalties, the amounts of which will be determined at a later date. As part of the settlement, Irwin agreed to the entry of an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.

286,"On August 9, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged John C. Maccoll, a Michigan resident, with defrauding retail brokerage customers out of nearly $4 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that between January 2006 and March 2018 he lied and used high pressure sales tactics to solicit his customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after private fund investment. According to the SEC, from at least 2008 through March of 2018 the defendants defrauded customers by telling them that they could invest their money in a fund that was highly sought after, exclusive, and outside of Broker-Dealer A's investment platform. The complaint further alleges, however, that instead of using the customers' money for their retirement and college expenses, MacColl used the money to make Ponzi-like payments to certain of his victims, including his own deceased husband's life insurance payout, which he intended to use to pay for college for his three children. In a parallel action, on August 10, 2019, U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stoltz entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, penny stock bar, an officer-and-director bar and a broker-dealer bar. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the Commission's allegations, defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling more than $3.6 million, for a total of over $1.5 million in profits and losses. Under the proposed settlement, all defendants will be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the federal securities laws and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 63 and 66 ofÂ Securities Act Section 15(f) (the ""Defendants Act"") and Rules 5a-14, 5b2-1 and 17b3-2 there under. Specifically, Defendants consented to entry of a proposed final judgment that, subject to Court approval, would:  (i) require defendants to disgorge $566,849 in illicit profits from their fraudulent scheme; (ii) impose a civil penalty of $75,000; and(iii","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers out of nearly $4 million in a long-running investment scam.  According to the SEC's complaint, John C. Maccoll, who was affiliated with the Birmingham, Michigan branch of a nationwide registered broker dealer and investment adviser, used high pressure sales tactics to solicit at least 15 of his retail brokerage customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after private fund investment.  Most of the injured customers were elderly and retired and invested through their retirement accounts.  Maccoll told his customers that the purported fund investment would allow them to diversify their portfolios, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and give them investment growth potential that was better than the growth they received in their brokerage accounts.  As alleged in the complaint, Maccoll's statements to his customers were false - he did not invest the customers' money but stole it for his own personal use.  In total, the customers invested nearly $4 million in the fraudulent scheme.  To conceal the scheme, Maccoll allegedly instructed his customers not to tell others about the purported fund investment, provided some of his customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns, and paid over $400,000 in Ponzi-like payments to certain of the customers to keep the scheme alive.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today filed criminal charges against Maccoll.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Maccoll with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Maccoll to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.

Transocean Inc., United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Eastern Division, Civil Action No.: 1:01-CV-01891 (RIG) (D.C.)   The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United Kingdom and elsewhere against the company for its violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2002 through 2007, Transcean made illicit payments through its customs agents to Nigerian government officials to extend the temporary importation status of its drilling rigs, to obtain false paperwork associated with its rigs and a bond registration. In addition, the complaint alleges that in order to expedite the importations of goods and materials into Nigeria by the drilling rig and other equipment, transoigler Panalpina World Transport Holding Ltd. (PTC), a Nigerian company, made false and misleading statements in its internal accounting books. The complaint further alleges, among other things, that the payments were made through a company owned and controlled by a former Nigerian official, a senior executive, or through an entity owned by an officer or director of a public company. As a result of these improper payments and the improper use of cash and documents in connection with the transactions, profits from the illicit transactions were approximately $5,981,693 and $3,172,427, respectively. Without admitting or denying the allegations in today's Complaint or filing of an enforcement action, all defendants have consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 14(e) of The Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20 and 13b2-1 thereunder, as well as the books-and-records provisions under Section 30B. On consenting to these judgments, each defendant has agreed to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $1.09 million, with a $100,000 civil penalty, which will be deemed satisfied by payment of restitution in a related administrative proceeding. Each defendant also has a right to reapply at a later date for a hearing on the Commission's motion for an asset freeze against him.","-->            Home &#160;&gt;&#160; Litigation &#160;&gt;&#160; Litigation Releases &#160;&gt;&#160; 2010    2010  -->  -->            U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONLitigation Release No. 21725 / November 4, 2010Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3202 / November 4, 2010Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Transocean Inc., Civil Action No. 1:10-CV-01891 (JDB) (D.D.C.)SEC CHARGES TRANSOCEAN FOR BRIBERY SCHEME IN NIGERIA â TRANSOCEAN TO PAY DISGORGEMENT AND CIVIL PENALTIES OF $7,265,080The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled enforcement action on November 4, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Transocean Inc. (âTransoceanâ), an international provider of offshore drilling services and equipment to oil companies throughout the world, with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ). Transocean has agreed to pay disgorgement, interest, and a civil penalty totaling $7,265,080 to settle the charges.Â The SECâs complaint alleges that:From at least 2002 through 2007, Transocean made illicit payments through its customs agents to Nigerian government officials to extend the temporary importation status of its drilling rigs, to obtain false paperwork associated with its drilling rigs, and obtain inward clearance authorizations for its rigs and a bond registration. In addition, Transocean made illicit payments through Panalpina World Transport Holding Ltd.âs Pancourier express courier service to Nigerian government officials to expedite the import of various goods, equipment and materials into Nigeria. In most instances, customs duties for these items were not paid by either Panalpina or Transocean. Transocean also made illicit payments through Panalpina to Nigerian government officials to expedite the delivery of medicine and other materials into Nigeria. Transoceanâs total gains from the conduct were approximately $5,981,693.In 2002, certain Transocean managers, including the then Executive Vice President, Operations and Chief Operating Officer (âCOOâ), authorized four âpaper movesâ for two rigs operating in Nigeria because Transocean was unwilling to interrupt profitable drilling operations once the relevant Temporary Import Permit (âTIPâ) or TIP extension had expired. On June 10, 2002, Transoceanâs then Country Manager in Nigeria sent an e-mail to the then Africa Region Manager, indicating that there was a temporary import issue related to three rigs. In the e-mail the Country Manager sought permission to do paper moves, which would falsely depict the rigs leaving and reentering the country. The Country Manager indicated that the paper moves were necessary in order to create a more âdefendableâ file and to enable Transocean to avoid severe penalties connected to failing to move the rigs once the relevant TIP had expired. The e-mail also contained a quote from Transoceanâs customs agent for the cost of obtaining false paperwork related to the paper moves from the Nigeria Customs Service (âNCSâ). The Country Manager added that âThe only alternative is to physically move the rigs out of the country, and this is clearly not acceptable.â On June 11, 2002, the Africa Region Manager sent an e-mail to the Executive Vice President, Operations and COO in Houston, seeking authorization for the paper moves. The same day, the Executive Vice President, Operations and COO sent an e-mail approving the paper moves. Another paper move involving a third rig also occurred in 2002, and two additional paper moves involving a fourth rig occurred in 2007. Transoceanâs total gain from the paper moves was approximately $4,261,363.Â Prior to the 2007 paper moves, Transocean was on notice of problems with its TIP process. On April 27, 2004, the Nigerian Temporary Import Permit Panel (the âTIP Panelâ) notified Transocean that Transocean would be penalized approximately $1.17 million after an investigation showed Transocean had not complied with TIP laws. In May 2004, Transoceanâs Corporate Affairs Manager in Nigeria sent several emails informing the Transocean customs supervisor that he had visited a member of the TIP Panel and discussed making a payment to reduce the penalty. In particular, the email stated that âWe will spend money on them [TIP Panel members] through him, but definitely we will pay less to the Federal Government.â On July 28, 2004, the penalty was reduced to $340,000. While there is no record indicating what payment, if any, was in fact made to the Nigerian TIP Panel official, the TIP Panel investigation put Transocean on notice that there were problems with the TIP process.From approximately 2002 to 2006, Transocean also made illicit payments totaling $207,170 to a second customs agent for what were described on invoices as âcustoms interventionâ charges related to six rigs. Transoceanâs employees believed that the invoiced âinterventionâ charges were likely illicit payments to customs officials. From 2002 to 2007, Transocean also made illicit payments to Nigerian customs officials through Panalpina, a freight forwarding company headquartered in Switzerland, and Panalpinaâs express door to door courier service, Pancourier, to import goods and materials into Nigeria without paying applicable duties to Nigerian customs officials. Pancourier invoiced Transocean for âlocal processing chargesâ related to the shipments, and the invoice amounts were typically 25% to 40% of the actual duties owed.Â The total customs duties that Transocean avoided through its use of Pancourier were approximately $1,480,419. Transocean also used Panalpina to make illicit payments to Nigerian government officials to expedite the delivery of medicine and other goods totaling $32,741.Transocean violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when its senior management and employees made illicit payments through their freight forwarding and customs agents to Nigerian government officials to obtain various customs-related benefits. Transocean violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect the violations. Transocean violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by failing to make and keep accurate books and records. In related criminal proceedings, Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section and agreed to pay $13.44 million.Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Transocean has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and ordering it to pay $5,981,693 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest of $1,283,387.Â The SEC acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Â 								  See Also:      SEC Complaint                  							    &nbsp;     http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21725.htm",0.758,0.3862

The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Massachusetts against David Levine (""Levine"") and four individuals for their participation in a fraudulent accounting scheme that inflated the company's net income by approximately $4.8 million or almost 2 percent, as originally reported.  According to the Commission's complaint, Kmart obtained from its vendors various promotional and marketing activities. A significant number of allowances were prematurely ""pulled forward"" on the basis of undisclosed side agreements. As a result of the misconduct, the complaint alleges that the false accounting was resulting from a material overstatement of KMart's cost of goods sold and earnings expectations for its divisions. The complaint also names two individuals as defendants:  (1) former Divisional President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Levine (2) and former Director of Merchandising and Sales Operations Barry Berlin (3) of Newell Rubbermaid, Inc. (a division of which Berlin was a member), and (4) current National Manager Douglas Ely (deceased and/or promoted). The Commission alleges in its complaint that Levine participated in pulling forward of vendor ""allowances"" in an effort to meet senior management's earnings expectation for divisions, including the Home Storage division, where he was responsible for forwarding millions of dollars in vendor allowance payments. In a parallel action, on August 30, 2004, a federal district court in Detroit, Michigan entered a final judgment against the defendants, ordering them to pay a total of more than $1.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and imposing civil penalties equal to their respective monetary relief. Without admitting or denying the findings, Levine and Berlin consented to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 15(c), 16(d), 17(e)(1), 19(f) (AJW), or 17 (b)(2)(A) or (B) thereunder, orders them each to disgorge","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19353 / August 30, 2005  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No.  2303 / August 30, 2005  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

The Commission alleges that these individuals caused Kmart to issue materially false financial statements by improperly accounting for millions of dollars worth of vendor ""allowances.""  Kmart obtained allowances from its vendors for various promotional and marketing activities.  According to the Commission, defendants caused Kmart to recognize allowances prematurely on the basis of false information provided to the company's accounting department.  Vendor representatives participated in the violations by co-signing false and misleading accounting documents.  As a result, Kmart's net income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2001, was overstated by approximately $4.8 million as originally reported.  The company restated its financial statements after filing for bankruptcy to correct these and other accounting errors.   Levine is a former Divisional Vice President of Kmart's do-it-yourself division; Spake is a former Kmart buyer in Kmart's home storage division; Berlin is a former Director of Sales at Newell Rubbermaid for the Kmart account; and Ely is a former National Account Manager at Newell Rubbermaid for the Kmart account.

The Commission's complaint alleges that between 2002 and 2004, Schmidt raised over $1 million from 65 investors throughout California, Nevada and the Pacific Northwest by providing fraudulent financial information to investors and promising tremendous profits. By March 2005, however, it was the former CEO and sole owner that raised most of the funds. In addition to the emergency relief sought by the Honorable James A.

The Commission&#8217;s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that, between 2002 and 2004, Nuvo co-founder Jeffrey Schmidt, 45, of Henderson, Nevada, falsely promised dozens of investors profits of 30% to 40% when he knew Nuvo&#8217;s business was in precarious financial shape.  Nuvo has since filed for bankruptcy.  According to the complaint, Schmidt told investors their investments would finance particular new Nuvo locations, when in reality Schmidt spent the money to prop up the failing business, pay executives (including $680,000 to himself), and pay preexisting investors to maintain an illusion of profitability.  Schmidt also provided investors with false income statements showing the retail locations to be substantially more profitable than they actually were.  The complaint further alleges that Nuvo&#8217;s former Chief Operating Officer Norman Valine, 39, of Las Vegas, Nevada, and a Nuvo co-owner Gary Gelnette, 51, of Concord, California, raised money from new investors even after suspecting that Schmidt may have embezzled funds and falsified financial records.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that in late 2004, Gelnette, a former pastor, helped raise $1.35 million from a former parishioner, while Valine reaped $138,000 in commissions by selling Nuvo interests to four additional investors.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that Schmidt, Gelnette and Valine violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges Schmidt and Valine with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission seeks disgorgement, civil money penalties, and injunctive relief.

Wall Street Capital Funding LLC, Philip Cardwell, Roy Campbell, and Aaron Hume, Case No.: 1:11-CV-20413-DLG (SDFL)  SEC CHARGES STOCK PROMOTERS WITH FRAUDULENTLY ACCOUNTING SCHEME  On February 5, 2012, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida charging penny-stock promoters with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from April 2009 to January 2010, defendants created and distributed promotional materials for a supposed oil-exploration company known as PrimeGen Energy Corp. (""PrimeGen""), which purported to have operations in Russia. According to the complaint, these materials provided the appearance of an independent basis for their statements about the company. The complaint further alleges the defendants engaged in a classic ""pump and dump"" scheme in which they disseminated false and misleading information to investors. In fact, as alleged, all defendants made their living repackaging &#8220;news&#8221; released by penny stock companies and distributing it along with their own, always optimistic commentary.&nbsp; Over the course of their long careers, each defendant has knowingly or recklessly played a critical role in numerous penny stocks scams. For example, one defendant made a series of false statements in his own company's press releases about his company, Caliber Energy, Inc., and then distributed them to as many as 52 million investors at once, generating more than $1.5 million in illicit profits for himself and his companies. Another defendant allegedly made baseless claims about a purported oil exploration project in China when, in reality, he had no basis in fact for his statements. Finally, a third defendant falsely stated that he or she had researched the background of a company that had been promoted, but had not approved the timing of its public release, when he and Campbell knew that the information was inaccurate and they had coordinated with each other to create the false appearance that their companies were being promoted. As a result, they have been charged with violations of Sections 17(a)(1), (3) and (4) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange","SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  22125 / OCTOBER 14, 2011  SEC v. Wall Street Capital Funding LLC, Philip Cardwell, Roy Campbell, and Aaron Hume, Civil Action No. 11-cv-20413-DLG (S.D. Fla.)  On October 13, 2011 the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered judgments against a group of penny-stock promoters arising out of their repackaging of &#8220;news&#8221; issued by a series of sham energy companies. The judgments, which the defendants consented to as part of a settlement with the Commission, require them to pay penalties and to disgorge profits from their illicit activities. The judgments also permanently ban the defendants from touting and other dealings involving penny stocks.  The judgments came in a civil action that the Commission filed earlier this year against Miami-based stock-touting company Wall Street Capital Funding LLC (WSCF) and its principals &#8211; owners Philip Cardwell and Roy Campbell and their associate Aaron Hume. In its Complaint initiating the action, the SEC alleged that the defendants were in the business of distributing promotional materials styled as &#8220;Wall Street News Alerts&#8221; for penny-stock companies. According to the SEC, one such company, PrimeGen Energy Corp., purported to have great success in drilling for oil in 2009 and 2010. The SEC alleged, however, that PrimeGen was phony: its corporate headquarters were a rented mailbox in a UPS Store opened with a do-not-forward instruction; its phone line was unattended; and its web page was generated by copying the source code from another company&#8217;s web site. As alleged in the Complaint, WSCF&#8217;s &#8220;investment opinions,&#8221; emails, and web profiles typically expressed positive opinions about penny-stock companies, their business prospects, and the future direction of their stock price. WSCF, according to the Complaint, created the misleading appearance of an independent basis for its statements even though it was merely repeating the penny-stock companies&#8217; claims. Moreover, the SEC alleged, even when the defendants received ample warning signs that a scam was afoot, they always did the same thing: they closed their eyes and published.  The SEC&#8217;s Complaint was filed February 7, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Complaint charged Wall Street Capital Funding LLC, Philip Cardwell, Roy Campbell, and Aaron Hume with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in connection with securities transactions. Judge Donald L. Graham presided over the action, No. 11-cv-20413-DLG. The judgments imposed by Judge Graham require the defendants, among other things, to pay penalties and disgorgement totaling $300,000, and permanently bar them from promotional activities and other dealings involving penny stocks. The defendants consented to the judgments without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s allegations.  The SEC&#8217;s action was litigated by Todd D. Brody and Daniel R. Walfish, and originated from an investigation handled by Celeste Chase and Mr. Walfish, all of the SEC&#8217;s New York Regional Office.

The complaint also alleges the Defendants violated Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4)-1 of SEC Rule 206. In addition, as set forth below, defendants have been ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,072.25, which includes a $50,000 civil penalty and an order barring defendants from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.Â  The defendants also have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-bribery provisions and to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, or profits, respectively, in amounts to either the amount of their respective civil monetary penalties or the amounts being paid by defendants in a separate administrative proceeding.The SEC previously filed similar charges against two defendants for fraudulently inflating the value of assets of two companies controlled by the same defendants. One defendant pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while the other defendant pleaded guilty for aiding and abetting the fraudulent issuance and sale of securities by a third party, a broker-dealer, for which he was sentenced to a prison term of three years and a fine of more than $2 million. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendant defendants consented to entry of final judgments enjoining them from future violations, imposing a conduct-based injunction against each defendant and ordering him to comply with certain undertakings, barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, transfer agent, municipal securities dealer or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, from participating in any offering of any penny-stock transaction for at least two years, until the final judgment is final.

The SEC alleges that attorney Mark E. Fisher of Boca Raton, Florida and businessman Joseph F. Capuozzo of Sunrise, Florida received millions of shares of Valentine Beauty Inc. in connection with a pump-and-dump scheme orchestrated by Eddy U. Marin, who controlled Valentine.  Earlier this year, the SEC charged Marin and a stock promoter with fraud for their roles in the scheme.  The SEC alleges that Fisher and Capuozzo coordinated with Marin and others to launch a marketing campaign touting Valentine's purported operations.  Once the promotional campaign increased the liquidity and price of Valentine's stock, Fisher and Capuozzo sold a significant portion of their shares, collectively reaping more than $150,000 in stock sale proceeds.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Fisher and Capuozzo.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, charges Fisher and Capuozzo with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The complaint also charges Fisher with violating antifraud Rule 10b-5(b) of the Exchange Act.  Fisher and Capuozzo have agreed to settle the SEC's charges and be barred from the penny stock industry.  Capuozzo also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

S. District court in Atlanta, Georgia on June 18, 2011.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Anthony Wel (""Welch""), the former chairman and chief executive officer of both eHydrogen and ChromoCure, made false and misleading statements and omissions in press releases and filings with the Commission, and failed to disclose material non-public information regarding the two companies' histories of control changes and misuses of investor funds. In addition, Wel issued press statements in which he falsely stated that the companies had a 100% accuracy rate of detection for all cancers, when, in fact, they had little to no information about the nature of the cancer or its causes. The SEC further alleges Wel's statements were false because he was not a control person and that he had no control over the entities or their operations. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Welch has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 15(d) of Securities Exchange A and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and civil penalties of $10,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date. Welch also has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of five years and to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before any SEC court. According to SEC Complaint in this matter, from at least June 2009 through the end of 2010 Wel was the CEO and CFO of all three companies, including the company's flagship product, a Hydrog product called ""eHydrog.""

Anthony K. Welch, Civil Action No. 1:12-cv-3034 (ND Ga.)  SEC Charges Former Mississippi Investment Adviser, Now Based in Bahamas, With Fraud  On August 31, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Anthony K. Welch, a former investment adviser formerly of Oxford, Mississippi, with securities fraud in conjunction with a series of false and misleading press releases issued in 2010 by eHydrogen Solutions, Inc. (âeHydrogenâ) and ChromoCure, Inc. (âChromoCureâ), two now defunct microcap stock companies.  Welch served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the two companies during the relevant period and was responsible for the issuance of the false and misleading press releases of both companies.  Welch is now based offshore, most recently in Freeport, Bahamas.  The Commissionâs complaint alleges that from at least March 2010 through August 2010, Welch issued a series of press releases and made other public disclosures containing false and misleading information concerning, among other things, technologies acquired by and revenues generated by eHydrogen and ChromoCure.  The complaint also alleges that the period of the false and misleading press releases coincided with suspicious price and trading volume increases in the common stock of eHydrogen and ChromoCure, and further alleged that in multiple instances such statements were intentionally false and misleading, distributed by Welch for no purpose other than to incite trading activity and artificially inflate the price and trading volume of eHydrogen and ChromoCure.  For example, in a ChromoCure press release dated March 16, 2010, Welch stated among other things, â[t]he Companyâs proprietary Chromosomal Scanner systems have proven accurate and efficient in the measurement of the unique genomic characteristic found in 100% of all cancers and never found in normal cells.  The Companyâs detection technology has been proven to have an effective accuracy of 100% for all cancers at all stages.  This is superior to other detection approaches presently employed by pathologists, including biomarker detections, in every measurable way.â   The same press release also stated that â[t]he Companyâs detecting technology has an effective accuracy of 100% for all cancers at all stages.â  The complaint alleges that this representation was false and misleading and that Welch and ChromoCure issued the statement without any reasonable basis for it, because in reality no 100% accurate cancer detection system is known to exist in the world.  The Complaint alleges that Defendant Welch, by virtue of his conduct, directly or indirectly, has engaged and, unless enjoined, will engage in violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.10b-5].   Welch also has liability as a controlling person, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for violations by eHydrogen and ChromoCure of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. Welch is alternatively charged herein with aiding-and-abetting the antifraud violations of eHydrogen and ChromoCure.

The SEC alleges that John Cinderey, a former executive vice president at San Francisco-based United Commercial Bank, acting at the direction of his superiors, misled the outside auditors evaluating financial statements of the bank and its public holding company, UCBH Holdings, Inc.  In a complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, the SEC alleges that during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, Cinderey altered memoranda prepared for the independent auditors. The complaint also alleges that Cinderey circumvented accounting controls and policies that required the bank to accurately assess the risks associated with loans, and alleges that delays in accurately evaluating the risks in some cases could affect the bank&rsquo;s loan loss reserves and interest income.   Cinderey agreed to settle the SEC charges without admitting or denying the allegations. He will be permanently enjoined from violating provisions of the federal securities laws regarding record-keeping, misleading outside auditors, and internal controls. Cinderey will not pay a civil penalty in this case in part based on a $40,000 civil penalty he paid in an administrative action brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The terms of the settlement also reflect credit given to Cinderey by the Commission for his substantial assistance in the investigation and the fact that he has entered into an cooperation agreement to assist in an ongoing related enforcement action.  The Commission has previously charged senior executives at the bank and UCBH with committing securities fraud by making false and misleading statements to investors and UCBH&rsquo;s independent auditors. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on October 11, 2011, Case No. 11-CV-04998, the Commission alleges that former CEO Thomas Wu, former Chief Operating Officer Ebrahim Shabudin, and former executive vice president Thomas Yu deliberately delayed the proper recording of loan losses as the company prepared its 2008 financial statements. SEC Litigation Release No. 22121.  The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Cinderey with aiding and abetting UCBH&rsquo;s violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), circumventing accounting controls in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and falsifying books and records and making false or misleading statements to auditors in violation of Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.   The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the FDIC, U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Northern District of California, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), FDIC&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General, and Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

297,"UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  18728 / December 20, 2002  SEC v. Andre S. FASTOW, Civil Action No. 1:02-CV-00308 (S.D. Tex.)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, charging a Texas resident with securities fraud and other violations of the securities laws. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 1997 through at the height of his fraudulent scheme, and continuing to engage in this conduct, Andrés F. Fastow, a resident of Houston, Tex., violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) thereunder and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 12b3-2 and 13a-13 thereon. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fastew has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. In a related matter, the Commission today instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Feltow in connection with the same conduct alleged in its complaint filed against him in federal court in Houston. On December 14, 2001, in response to a subpoena issued to him by a U.S.-based broker-dealer, First World Financial Services, Inc. (""Fitch"") filed an application for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, an expedited discovery and an accounting of financial statements that had been filed by then-Director of Business Operations at Fitch's Atlanta Regional Office. Today's action follows a similar action filed on December 13, 1999, against former Vice President of Finance and Controller of Financial Instruments, Robert A. Bentsen, Jr. (a.k.a., ""B.A."" ""Bob"") of New York, N.Y., and former Director of Accounting and Auditing Enforcement, respectively, for aiding and abetting the filing of false and misleading statements and omissions by Fittings and others. For example, on January 12, 2000, Fettings issued a press release announcing","UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 17762 / October 2, 2002  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1640 / October 2, 2002  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Andrew S. Fastow, Civil Action No. H-02-3666 (K.Hoyt) (SDTX) (October 2, 2002)  SEC CHARGES ANDREW S. FASTOW, FORMER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF ENRON, WITH FRAUD  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil enforcement action today against Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron Corp., alleging violations of the anti-fraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission is seeking disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including all compensation received subsequent to the commencement of the alleged fraud, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company, and an injunction from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission brought this action in coordination with the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, which filed a related criminal complaint against Fastow.  The complaint allegations stem from Fastow's conduct relating to six transactions.  Three of the transactions, RADR, Chewco, and Southampton, were the subject of the Commission's earlier settled action against Michael Kopper.  Those transactions were part of an alleged scheme to hide Fastow's and Kopper's interest in and control of certain entities in order to keep those entities off Enron's balance sheet.  This was done, according to the complaint, for self-enrichment and to mislead analysts, rating agencies, and others about Enron's true financial condition.  As to Fastow's role in RADR, Chewco, and Southampton, the complaint alleges that Fastow secretly nominated certain of the owners of these entities, funded certain of their investments through undisclosed loans, collected undisclosed fees, and demanded and received under-the-table payments, including payments to himself and his family members disguised as yearly $10,000 non-taxable gifts.  Two of the remaining three transactions, the Nigerian barges and the Cuiaba transaction, are alleged to have been sham sales - best described as secret asset-parking arrangements.  In one of these sales, a sale of an interest in certain Nigerian barges to a financial institution, Fastow is alleged to have personally promised that the financial institution would be taken out of its so-called investment and later arranged for an entity he controlled to buy the financial institution's interest at a pre-arranged rate of return on a pre-arranged time table.  In the second sale, Enron entered into a transaction with an off-balance-sheet entity controlled by Fastow to sell an interest in a severely troubled power plant in Cuiaba, Brazil, in order to avoid consolidation of project debt and recognize earnings.  In connection with this transaction, Fastow allegedly entered into an unwritten side agreement with Enron requiring Enron to buy back the interest it just sold to Fastow at a guaranteed profit.  The last set of allegations included in the complaint relate to an alleged instance of backdating documents to avoid diminution in Enron's investment in the stock of a technology company.  Specifically, according to the complaint, in September 2000, Fastow and others created documents that purported to lock in the value of Enron's investment in that company back in August of 2000, when that company's stock was trading at its all-time high price.  Throughout the period of his alleged fraudulent conduct, Fastow sold millions of dollars worth of Enron securities.  Specifically, the Commission's complaint further alleges as follows:     RADR:  In early 1997, Enron needed to divest itself of certain electricity-generating windmill farms to maintain certain financial benefits under applicable energy regulations.  A sale to independent third-party investors would have entailed relinquishing control over these windmill farms, an eventuality Enron wanted to avoid.  To maintain control of these assets, Fastow selected certain individuals to act as nominee investors in the entities (collectively referred to as &quot;RADR&quot;) that purchased the windmill farms.  To provide the funds for the purchase, Fastow made a secret personal loan to Kopper, who in turn made loans to the nominee investors.  Between August 1997 and July 2000, these entities generated approximately $2.7 million in unlawful profits.  In July 2000, Enron repurchased the facilities from the entities, generating an additional gain of approximately of $1.8 million.  Between 1997 and 2000, Kopper made substantial payments to Fastow from these unlawful profits.  One mechanism employed to funnel to Fastow money generated by this scheme was a &quot;gifting&quot; program whereby Kopper and Kopper's domestic partner made annual &quot;gifts&quot; of $10,000 to each member of Fastow's immediate family.  Fastow chose the $10,000 amount to avoid IRS reporting rules.   Chewco:  In 1997, Enron and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) were joint venture partners in an off-balance-sheet investment vehicle called Joint Energy Development Limited Partnership (JEDI).  When CalPERS wanted to cash out its investment in JEDI prior to investing in a larger Enron venture, Fastow and others at Enron formed a special purpose entity called Chewco to buy CalPERS' interest in JEDI thereby allowing Enron to continue accounting for JEDI as an off-balance-sheet entity.  Initially, Fastow planned to serve as Chewco's general partner and as an equity investor, but was advised that his involvement would require disclosure by Enron.  Fastow then selected Michael Kopper to fill the Chewco general partner role.  Fastow secretly controlled Chewco and Kopper and, by virtue of that control, received a share of Chewco's profits as kickbacks from Kopper.  In addition, Fastow siphoned funds from Enron by using his position as Enron's CFO to funnel funds to Chewco for his own benefit.  As a result of these various machinations, Chewco was improperly kept off Enron's balance sheet because it did not have the third-party equity at risk required by the applicable accounting rules.  Improper deconsolidation of Chewco caused material overstatement of Enron's reported net income and a material understatement of its debt.   Southampton:  Fastow unlawfully enriched himself and others using another off-balance-sheet partnership he controlled called LJM Cayman, L.P. (&quot;LJM1&quot;).  In approximately February 2000, Fastow and others caused Enron to buy out the partnership interests of LJM1's two limited partners, Credit Suisse First Boston and National Westminster Bank (NatWest).  In connection with this transaction, Fastow and others told Enron that NatWest wanted $20 million for its interest in the partnership assets, but paid NatWest only $1 million of that sum and pocketed the rest.  A purported charitable foundation in the name of the Fastow's family received $4.5 million in proceeds of this fraud.   Nigerian Barges:  In December 1999, Enron and a financial institution entered into a sham &quot;sale&quot; transaction that enabled Enron to book approximately $12 million in earnings in 1999.  In the transaction, the financial institution agreed to &quot;buy&quot; from Enron an interest in certain power-producing barges in Nigeria based on an express oral promise from Fastow that Enron would arrange to take the financial institution out of the investment within six months.  Enron also agreed to a specified profit for the financial institution's &quot;investment.&quot;  The transaction closed at the end of December 1999.  Six months later, Fastow fulfilled his promise to take the financial institution out of the deal.  He arranged for a partnership he controlled, LJM2 Co-Investment, L.P. (&quot;LJM2&quot;) to purchase the financial institution's interest on the previously-agreed terms.   Raptor I/Avici:  Enron and LJM2 engaged in complex transactions with an entity called Raptor I.  Raptor I was used to manipulate Enron's balance sheet and income statement and to generate profits for LJM2 and Fastow at Enron's expense.  In September 2000, Fastow and others used Raptor&#160;I to effectuate a fraudulent hedging transaction and thus avoid a decrease in the value of Enron's investment in the stock of a public company called Avici Systems&#160;Inc.  Specifically, Fastow and others back-dated documents to make it appear that Enron locked in the value of its investment in Avici in August of 2000, when Avici's stock was trading at its all time high price.   The Cuiaba Project:  To avoid consolidation of debt related to a power-plant project in Cuiaba, Brazil, and to recognize earnings, Enron entered into a sham sale with LJM1.  Fastow arranged for LJM1 to buy an interest in the plant despite significant cost overruns, completion delays, and operational problems, after Enron failed to secure an independent buyer.  However, in connection with this transaction, Fastow had entered into an unwritten side agreement with Enron (which Enron later honored) requiring Enron to buy back the interest it sold to LJM1 at a guaranteed profit regardless of the risks associated with the project.  The complaint alleges that by engaging in the above-described conduct, Fastow violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&quot;Securities Act&quot;); violated and aided and abetted the violation of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;) and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2; aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; and acted as a controlling person of Enron Corp. and certain of its executives and employees within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and by virtue of that control, violated and aided and abetted the violation of the above-enumerated Exchange Act provisions and rules.  The Commission's investigation is continuing.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it has amended its complaint to add the following defendant:  Former Regional Director for Africa at ITXC Corp. (ITX) in Princeton, New Jersey.  In its amended complaint, the Commission alleges that YAW OSEI AMOAKO bribed foreign government officials in Nigeria, Rwanda, and Senegal in order to obtain and retain business with a number of international telephone companies. The Commission further alleges Amoo received kickbacks in 2004 of $50,000 in connection with the scheme.&nbsp;  According to the Complaint, in the period from November 2002 to October 2003, IT XC obtained and retained contracts with these foreign companies that generated profits in amounts: (a) $1,136,618 from Nitel; (b) a $217,418 from Rwandatel; and (c) an additional $10,155,696 from Sonatel, which was partially owned by the government of Senegal. During the relevant period, it was also alleged that the bribes were made through wire transfers to its account at PNC Bank in Newark, NJ. In addition to paying the kickback, Amoleo also received a kick-back in 2005 of a total of approximately $100,622 from his own bribery scheme in which he received more than $3.3 million in kick back and commissions from the bribe payments to a senior government official of one of the foreign countries. As a result of his bribery schemes and his misappropriation of ill-gotten gains from these schemes, he has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to an order permanently enjoining him from violating the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 thereunder.

Former Executives Of ITXC Corp. Settle Foreign Bribery Charges  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on April 18, 2008, the Honorable Garrett E. Brown Jr., Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, entered final judgments against Steven J. Ott and Roger Michael Young, in SEC v. Steven J. Ott and Roger Michael Young, Civil Action No. 06-4195 (GEB) (D.N.J.), and against Yaw Osei Amoako, in SEC v. Yaw Osei Amoako, Civil Action No. 05-4284 (GEB) (D.N.J.).  The final judgments resolve the Commission's claims against the defendants, including claims in the Commission's amended complaint against Amoako filed in April 2008.  The Commission charged Ott, Young and Amoako, former executives of ITXC Corp., with violations of the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), for their respective roles in a scheme to bribe senior officials of government-owned telephone companies in Nigeria, Rwanda and Senegal.  Prior to its acquisition by Teleglobe International Holdings Ltd. on May 31, 2004, ITXC was a publicly-held international telecommunications carrier based in Princeton, New Jersey.  The complaints alleged that Ott, ITXC's former Vice President for Global Sales, Young, ITXC's former Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, and Amoako, ITXC's former Regional Director for Sales in Africa, negotiated and/or approved bribes that ITXC paid to foreign officials in Nigeria, Rwanda and Senegal, in order to obtain contracts necessary for ITXC to transmit telephone calls to individuals and businesses in those countries.  As alleged in the complaints, the defendants were responsible for $267,468.95 in bribes that ITXC paid between August 2001 and May 2004.  According to the complaints, ITXC made $11,509,733 in net profits from the improperly obtained contracts.  The amended complaint against Amoako further alleged that he improperly received approximately $150,000 through embezzlement and a kickback in connection with the bribery scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaints, Ott, Young and Amoako each consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and, with respect to Ott and Young, violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B).  The final judgment against Amoako also orders him to pay $188,453 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  In parallel criminal proceedings brought by the Department of Justice, Ott, Young and Amoako each pled guilty to felony charges of conspiring to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act.  The Court sentenced Amoako to a prison term of 18 months and imposed a $7,500 fine.  The sentencing of Ott and Young is pending.

D.C.)  SEC CHARGES ABVOLVO WITH FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES VIOLATIONS  On March 22,Â 2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charging Volvo with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") when two of its subsidiaries and their agents and distributors made approximately $6,206,33 in kickback payments and authorized additional payments of $2,388,419 in connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 1999 through 2003, Volvo sold commercial trucks, buses and construction equipment in Iraq and made illicit payments to various Iraqi ministries in order to obtain and retain business. Volvo's subsidiaries, however, did not disclose that the kickbacks were paid in accordance with company policy and that such payments were prohibited by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and international trade sanctions on Iraq. The complaint further alleges Volvo failed to maintain adequate internal controls to detect and prevent these violations. In paying ""after-sales service fees"" and other improper payments, and failing to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls, that Volvo violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

As a result of that conduct, its American Depositary Receipts were frozen and its books and records were improperly recorded as if they were being used as part of an accounting audit.

AB Volvo, Civil Action No. 08 CV 00473 (D.D.C.) (JB)  SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against AB Volvo For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program &#8212; Company Agrees to Pay Over $12.6 Million in Civil Penalties, Disgorgement of Profits, and Interest    The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against AB Volvo in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. AB Volvo is a Swedish company that provides commercial transport solutions, including trucks, buses and construction equipment. The Commission's complaint alleges that from 1999 through 2003, two of AB Volvo's subsidiaries and their agents and distributors made approximately $6,206,331 in kickback payments, and authorized additional payments of $2,388,419 in connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the ""Program""). The kickbacks were characterized as ""after-sales service fees"" (""ASSFs""), but no bona fide services were performed. One of Volvo's subsidiaries also made other types of illicit payments to Iraq. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by AB Volvo's subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan.  According to the Commission's Complaint:  Between November 2000 and July 2001, AB Volvo's subsidiary, Renault Trucks SAS, entered into at least eighteen contracts under the Program to supply trucks. Renault Trucks then sub-contracted commercial bodybuilders to outfit the trucks with trailers or superstructures, commonly referred to as ""bodies,"" to tailor the trucks to the Iraqi ministries' specifications. In order to mask its payment of ASSFs, Renault Trucks devised a scheme in which the bodybuilders facilitated the ASSF payments to Iraq. The bodybuilders added the cost of the ASSF into their bodybuilding costs and submitted the total cost to Renault Trucks for payment. The bodybuilders then passed the ASSF payments to Iraq. Internal documents discuss the fact that had Renault Trucks made the payments in its own name, ""we would have been caught red-handed."" One bodybuilder signed side letters to pay the ASSF on Renault's behalf, and agreed to send Renault an invoice for the ASSF so that Renault would have paperwork to cover the scheme. ASSFs of $5,103,941 were paid, and another $1,255,922 was authorized but not paid.  Prior to Iraq's imposition of ASSF payments, one of AB Volvo's subsidiaries was paying kickbacks to obtain business. From October 1999 to July 2000, Volvo Construction Equipment International (""VCEI"") entered into four contracts under the Program in which more than $103,000 in kickbacks were paid to Iraqi ministries. On two contracts, illicit payments between 5% and 11.27% of the contract value were paid. An internal VCEI document discussed the extra trips VCEI staff had to make to Iraq in order to make the payments, and the possibility of having to give more than just payments. On one contract, VCEI documents indicate that VCEI gave its Jordanian Agent a total of $15,950 as ""the commitment to the third party whom support us and VOLVO to gain orders in the said ministry."" In addition, VCEI internal documents show that $19,000 was given to the Jordanian Agent to purchase a car for the Ministry of Interior. VCEI did not disclose the payments or the car to the U.N.  After Iraq began imposing ASSFs, VCEI or its distributors entered into five additional contracts. VCEI employees learned of the demands for ASSF payments when VCEI employees visited Iraq in November 2000. In an internal memorandum discussing the trip, the employees noted that the ASSF demand ""appears to be a clear violation of the UN Embargo Rules that we are expected to participate in."" In an e-mail, VCEI personnel discussed the need for handling the ASSF payments with ""utmost discretion."" On the first contract, VCEI inflated the U.N. contract price by ten percent, but did not disclose the ASSF to the U.N. VCEI then entered into a backdated agency agreement with its Jordanian Agent, who invoiced VCEI for its commission on the sale, including reimbursement of the ASSF payment. VCEI changed its method of doing business for future contracts in an effort to distance itself from the ASSF payments. VCEI made the Jordanian Agent its distributor, which allowed the Jordanian Agent to purchase vehicles directly from VCEI, and in turn sell directly to the U.N. at inflated prices. Thus, VCEI was no longer the party named on the U.N. contracts, but rather, the Jordanian Agent was the named party. With VCEI's knowledge, the Jordanian Agent made ASSF payments on these contracts. The Jordanian Agent did not have the infrastructure that normally would have been required by VCEI for its distributors, and VCEI did not enter into any written distributorship agreement. VCEI sold its products at a price that ensured the Jordanian Agent would have enough ""spread"" to enable the agent to make the ASSF payments. According to a U.N. report of an interview of the Jordanian Agent, the agent admitted that he personally paid kickbacks on behalf of VCEI. VCEI also used a Tunisian distributor to facilitate additional sales of its products to Iraq, and reduced its prices to the distributor to enable the distributor to make the ASSF payments. In total, VCEI or its distributors authorized more than $2.2 million in ASSF payments.  AB Volvo either knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were either offered or paid in connection with these transactions. AB Volvo failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments and its accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments. AB Volvo, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $7,299,208, in profits plus $1,303,441 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $4,000,000. AB Volvo will also pay a $7,000,000 penalty pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. Volvo is not the company that currently makes the ""Volvo"" brand car.  The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by AB Volvo and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee.

Benjamin Daniel DeHaan and Lighthouse Financial Partners, LLC, Civil Action File 1:12-cv-01996-TWT (N.D. Ga.)  SEC OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF AGAINST BENJAMIN DANIEL DEHAAN AND LIGHTHOUSE FINANCIAL PARTNERS LLC  The Securities &amp; Exchange; Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, against Benjamin D. Dehaan (DeHaans) and his investment advisory firm Lighthaughstamp, LP (Lighthouse), alleging that they engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the misappropriation of client funds.  According to the Commission's complaint, from approximately January 2011 through early May 2012, the defendants moved approximately $1.2 million from the custodial brokerage accounts of clients to a bank account they controlled, ostensibly to open new accounts for them at another broker-dealer. The complaint alleges that defendants intermittently thereafter transferred funds from this account to De Haan's personal account or to pay various business expenses.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the San Diego-based Titan Corporation (""Titan""), alleging that Titan violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") by paying over $3.5 million to its agent in Benin, Africa (""Benin Agent""), who was known at the time to be Titan's business advisor. According to the complaint, Titan made these payments to assist the company in its development of a telecommunication system project, and to obtain the government's consent to an increase of the percentage of project project management fees Titan paid. Titan also failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence into the background of this agent, either before or after his retention or thereafter. In its complaint filed today, the Commission alleges that from 1999 to December 2001, at least one former Titan officer and several former senior Titan officers, or executives, knew and/or approved of some or all of Titanâs FCPA violations, including the payment of approximately $2.6 million in commissions to a government agent and $1.1 million for consulting services in connection with the contract with a subsidiary of Datron World Communications (""DWC""), a division of which Titan was a part. As a result of these actions, on November 30, 2001 Titan, a publicly-traded company, was acquired by the New York Stock Exchange (""NSE"") and subsequently sold its entire portfolio of telecommunications equipment and services to two entities controlled by Titan: Titan Africa Inc. (""Agronetwork""), and Titan International, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that is now known as DWC. At the direction of one of its former officers and former executives based in California, one Titan executive directed Titan to submit numerous false documents to NSE and the SEC to determine whether the contracts included monies paid to foreign agents. Among other things, these documents falsely described that ""titanium has made substantial contributions to social programs and a new telephone system"" when, in fact, most of those payments were made to pay Titan executives in other countries, rather than to support the election campaign for that president of Ben","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19107 \ March 1, 2005  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2204 \ March 1, 2005  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

Simultaneously with the filing of the Commission's complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, Titan consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA and requiring it (i) to pay $15.479 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, (ii) to pay a $13 million penalty, which will be deemed satisfied by Titan's payment of criminal fines of that amount in parallel proceedings brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, and (iii) to retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA compliance and procedures and to adopt and implement the consultant's recommendations.   The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 1999 to 2001, Titan paid more than $3.5 million to its agent in Benin, Africa, who was known at the time by Titan to be the President of Benin's business advisor.  Titan failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence into the background of its agent either before his retention or thereafter and also failed to ensure that the services alleged to be performed by the agent, and described in his invoices, were in fact provided to Titan.  The complaint alleges, in 2001, at the direction of at least one former senior Titan officer based in the United States, Titan funneled approximately $2 million, via its agent in Benin, towards the election campaign of Benin's then-incumbent President.  The complaint also alleges that some of these funds were used to reimburse Titan's agent for the purchase to T-shirts adorned with the President's picture and instructions to vote for him in the upcoming election.  According to the complaint, Titan made these payments to assist the company in its development of a telecommunications project in Benin and to obtain the Benin government's consent to an increase in the percentage of Titan's project management fees for that project.  The complaint alleges that a former senior Titan officer directed that these payments be falsely invoiced by the agent as consulting services and that actual payment of the money be broken into smaller increments and spread out over time.  The complaint does not allege that the then-incumbent President knew of the payments.   The Commission's complaint also alleges that, from 1999 to 2003, Titan improperly recorded payments in its books and records, directed agents to falsify invoices submitted to Titan, and failed to devise or maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect other FCPA violations.  Despite utilizing over 120 agents and consultants in over 60 countries, Titan never had a formal company-wide FCPA policy, failed to implement an FCPA compliance program, disregarded or circumvented the limited FCPA policies and procedures in effect, failed to maintain sufficient due diligence files on its foreign agents, and failed to have meaningful oversight over its foreign agents.  According to the complaint, Titan falsified documents that enabled its agents to under-report local commission payments in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Titan falsified documents presented to the United States government by under-reporting payments on equipment exported to Sri Lanka, France and Japan.  The complaint also alleges that Titan (i) paid a World Bank Group analyst in cash to assist Titan in its project in Benin, and (ii) paid a Benin government official approximately $14,000 in travel expenses from 1999 to 2001.   Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Titan has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Titan also has agreed to disgorge $12,620,000, and to pay prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $2,859,195.47.  Under the terms of the final judgment, Titan will also retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA compliance and procedures and will adopt and implement the consultant's recommendations.   Also today the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section filed criminal FCPA charges and a tax charge against Titan, who entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Roger T. Benitez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California (United States of America v. Titan Corporation, Case No.05cr0314-BEN (S.D. Cal.)).  In particular, Titan agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one felony count for falsifying the books and records of Titan, and one felony count for violating Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7206(2) and to pay a criminal fine of $13 million. Commission's Report Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act The Commission also today issued a Report of Investigation pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act to provide guidance concerning potential liability under the antifraud and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws for publication of materially false or misleading disclosures regarding provisions in merger and other contractual agreements.   In its Report, the Commission stated that, on September 15, 2003, Titan became a party to a merger agreement with Lockheed Martin Corporation (""Lockheed"") in which Lockheed agreed to acquire Titan, pending certain contingencies.  Titan affirmatively represented in that merger agreement that to the knowledge of Titan, neither the company ""nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has taken any action which would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of the FCPA.""  This representation was publicly disclosed and disseminated by Titan in two places.  The proxy statement disclosed the nature of the representation.  The merger agreement containing the representation was also appended to Titan's proxy statement, which was filed with the Commission and sent to Titan's shareholders.     As the Report highlights, when an issuer makes a public disclosure of information -- via filing a proxy statement or otherwise -- the issuer is required to consider whether additional disclosure is necessary in order to put the information contained in, or otherwise incorporated into that publication, into context so that such information is not misleading.  The issuer cannot avoid this disclosure obligation simply because the information published was contained in an agreement or other document not prepared as a disclosure document.   The Report is not intended to change the way issuers engage in merger, or other contractual, negotiations or to alter existing diligence obligations or to suggest, absent special circumstances (such as provisions intended to create third party beneficiaries), that provisions such as representations and covenants in such agreements are binding on or intended to benefit persons other than parties thereto.  Representations, covenants, or other provisions of an agreement made by an issuer that are not public or disclosed to shareholders are not covered by the scope of this Report.  The Commission will consider bringing an enforcement action under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder in the future if it determines that the subject matter of representations or other contractual provisions is materially misleading to shareholders because material facts necessary to make that disclosure not misleading are omitted.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance in this investigation from the Department of Justice, Fraud Section; the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Diego Division; the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigations; and the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service.

Smart and Smart Assets, LLC, Civil Action No.: 09-CV-00224 (D. Utah)  SEC Charges Utah-Based Ponzi-like Scheme  The Securities &amp; ExchangeÂ Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Central District of Utah charging Brian Smart of Lehi, Utah, and his company, Smart Asset LLC (SALLC), with operating a P-2-1 scheme that defrauded at least five investors, some of whom are senior citizens, by misrepresenting the nature and risk of investments offered and diverting their investments to fund Smart's own personal use and business operations, which appear to consist solely of a network of failed investments in real estate and a now defunct privately held company.  According to the Commission's Complaint, the fraud progressed through three distinct stages as defendants became increasingly desperate to obtain additional new investor money to payoff existing investors and began to siphon the remaining funds entrusted to him in illiquid and ill-fated real-estate ventures. In the first stage, defendants solicited investors from acquaintances and clients he had at the financial planning and insurance firm in Anaheim, California. They were told that Smart was providing an investment opportunity for them to receive regular, monthly income from conservative investments, but that he was misappropriating the funds for his own purposes and investing the remainder of the money in an entity called Golden Key Investments, Inc. (AIM). Smart represented to these investors that, through the various entities associated with which he were affiliated, he would provide a conservative, sound investment strategy for their benefit. He also told one investor that the investments were ""diversified for clients primarily interested in a fixed rate strategy."" The complaint further alleges that in stage three the defendants began soliciting new investors with promissory notes and certificates to memorialize the monies invested. The defendants provided the investors an ""Membership Certificate"" for Smart assets, purportedly representing 200,000 units of membership in SALLC. According the certificate, in his capacity as an individual, was signed by Smart, who represented that his investment was not ""flashy,"" but very solid and safe."" Smart also allegedly provided some investor with a ""membership certificate"" representing the same amount invested by the defendant.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20946 / March 12, 2009  SEC v.

Smart and a private entity controlled by him, Smart Assets, LLC, from continuing to engage in the fraudulent offer and sale of securities.  The Honorable Bruce S. Jenkins of the United States District Court for the District of Utah also froze the defendants' assets, ordered that discovery be accelerated and that defendants be prohibited from destroying documents, ordered the defendants to promptly provide sworn accountings of investor funds and other assets, and ordered that a preliminary injunction hearing be held on March 20, 2009, to determine if the interim relief should be continued.  The Commission's Complaint, filed on March 11, alleges that Smart, a resident of Lehi, Utah, and Smart Assets engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in the offer and sale of promissory notes and other securities over a period extending back at least six years.  According to the Complaint, the defendants fraudulently raised approximately $1.68 million from investors, including senior citizens.  The Complaint further alleges that Smart went to great lengths to convince investors that he was a sophisticated financial planner, when in fact he was misappropriating funds for his own personal use and investing the remaining funds entrusted to him in illiquid and ill-fated real estate ventures.  According to the Complaint, Smart falsely represented to investors that he was providing a conservative, sound investment opportunity for them to receive regular, monthly income.  The Complaint also alleges that Smart solicited additional investors by providing these new investors with promissory notes and ""membership certificates"" in Smart Assets, claiming an interest payable on the notes ranging from 8.5% to 18% interest per annum.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants offered promissory notes to other investors falsely representing that they were using the invested money to lend out at higher rates.  The actual uses to which the money was put were allegedly not disclosed to investors.  According to the Complaint, Smart, through Smart Assets, operated a Ponzi-like scheme by using proceeds obtained from new investors to make payments to early investors.  Smart is further alleged to have misappropriated approximately $1.68 million of investor money for personal use, including purchasing a home and paying for his living expenses.  The Complaint alleges that Smart and Smart Assets violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to emergency and preliminary relief, the Commission's Complaint is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement and civil penalties.

Palmer, Anna M. R. Wells, and Steven S Etkind, United States District Court for the District of Colorado  SEC SUES ST. ANSELM EXPLORATION CO. AND THREE FORMER EXECUTIVES FOR FRAUDULENT OFFER AND SALE OF HIGH-DEUTSCHEMICAL ENFORCEMENT PRINCIPALS  The Securities &#8211;Commission filed a civil injunctive action on March 18, 2012, in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, charging Denver-based oil and gas exploration and development company St-Anselme Exploration Corp. and four former executives with misleading investors about the company's business prospects and financial condition.  According to the Commission's complaint, from 2007 to 2010, the defendants sold promissory notes to approximately 200 investors, reaping cash proceeds of more than $49 million. The complaint alleges that, as a result of their misrepresentations and sales of the notes, defendants misrepresented the nature of a company that had a long history, its business operations as well as the sources of its revenue. In particular, they failed to disclose the crippling magnitude of an entity's debt burden and the fact that it could only pay the interest and principal on its notes by selling more notes. Further, Defendants misled some investors concerning the existence of certain significant risks, including that the entity had no other means to service its debt and was falling further and further behind in its expenses, even after the companies had begun to default on maturing notes within a short period of time. Finally, while selling these notes at a profit, investors were left with the impression that their money was being used to repay their debt, when in fact they were pocketing the money for their own benefit and were losing it for personal expenses and for other personal benefit to themselves and their friends and family members.The complaint further alleges, among other things, that:   Defendants told prospective investors that they enjoyed ""robust economics"" and that its oil-and-gas investments generated ""sufficient cash to pay"" their debts and provided a return on their investments.&nbsp;  They also represented to investors the very substantial risks of investing in a geothermal","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21891 / March 18, 2011  SEC v.

(St. Anselm); its three principals, Michael A. Zakroff, Anna M.R. Wells, and Mark S. Palmer; and Steven S. Etkind, its vice president of corporate development, with securities fraud.  Specifically, the Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that from at least January 2007 through August 16, 2010, the Defendants engaged in a fraudulent high-interest promissory note program to fund St. Anselm&#8217;s operations.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint specifically alleges that defendants Zakroff, Wells, and Palmer, all of whom reside in Colorado, and Etkind, who resides in New Mexico, solicited investors in New Mexico, Colorado, and other states and offered high annual investment returns ranging from 18-36%.  The complaint also alleges that as of September 30, 2010, St. Anselm owed approximately 200 investors a total of over $62 million in outstanding notes.  The complaint further alleges that the Defendants solicited investors by falsely representing and implying that St. Anselm was profitable and able to pay investors both from the recurring revenue from oil and gas production and from the larger, but less frequent, sales of asset packages.  The complaint also alleges that the Defendants failed to disclose to investors St. Anselm&#8217;s true financial condition and that St. Anselm depended on the proceeds of new promissory note sales to service its debt.  In fact, from January 2007 to August 16, 2010, St. Anselm had paid investor returns and note redemptions almost exclusively with funds from other investors in Ponzi-like fashion.        The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Mikula, for conducting a fraudulent, unregistered offering of securities in the form of investment contracts.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants operated the Internet website www.phoenixsurfing.org, which purported to be a ""traffic exchange program"" whose members purportedly earned money for viewing the websites that other paying users had submitted to the website. The complaint further alleges, however, that no registration statement was filed with respect to this offering or the sale of the securities, as required by the federal securities laws, nor did the Defendants disclose that they paid advertising fees to existing and existing investors and that new investors' advertising package purchases accounted for nearly all the funds paid to investors. In addition, they failed to inform investors that, at the end of eight days, each advertising user earned a total of 120% per day in return for 20% of their advertising fee. As a result of this conduct, defendants were charged with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $36.7 million and a $12.5 million civil penalty, in addition to imposing a permanent officer-and-director bar and penny stock bar against each of them for a period of five years.

The Commission's action, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that from Feb. 22, 2006, through May 21, 2006, four defendants operated a website &#8212; Phoenixsurf.com &#8212; that offered investors a 120% return in just 8 days on investments ranging from $8 to $6,000 in a purported ""traffic exchange program.""  The Commission's complaint against Jonathan W. Mikula, age 21, of Athens, Ga., Gabriel J. Frankewich, age 29, of Byron, Ga., New Millenium Enterpreneurs, LLC, and Phoenixsurf.com. alleges that under the purported program, to receive the promised return, investors had to purchase advertising and view at least 15 web pages of advertising per day during the 8 day period. Although the defendants represented that they would pay the promised returns with funds received from investors and other ""businesses/programs within the NME/Phoenix network,"" they operated Phoenixsurf.com primarily as a pure Ponzi scheme &#8212; using for the most part only new investor funds to pay the promised returns to existing investors. The complaint alleges that the defendants paid investors $36.7 million, almost all of which came from advertising purchases from new investments in the scheme.  To settle the Commission's charges, the defendants consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against David Chu and his company, Quest Capital Strategies, Inc. (collectively, ""Quest Capital"").  The Commission's complaint alleges that, since at least 1997, the defendants have engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the value of Quest's common stock by artificially inflating the price and volume of its common shares, thereby causing the company to overstate its pre-tax earnings per share by more than 20%.  According to the complaint, as part of the scheme, Chow and Quest capital misappropriated investor funds for their personal use and to pay for personal expenses, including rent on a home, car, and apartment, for a total of over $1.5 million in cash payments to investors, which were to be paid to a third-party broker-dealer in exchange for access to Quest stock and other non-public information about Quest and its business operations, in violation of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4)-8 of Company Act Section 17(e)(2) for its fiscal year-end period ended December 31, 1997.Â   Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, all defendants consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties, with the right to reapply at a later date, subject to approval by the court, pursuant to Section 206 (1).  In a related administrative proceeding, on July 20, 1999, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and penny stock bars against Chow.

Quest Capital Strategies, Inc. and David Chen Yu, Civil Action No. 02 CV 1512 (D.D.C.)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a complaint and application for a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to enforce a supervisory bar the Commission previously imposed on David Chen Yu.  The Commission's complaint charges that Yu is continuing to act as a supervisor at Quest Capital Strategies, Inc. in violation of a supervisory bar imposed by the Commission in an Order Imposing Remedial Sanctions issued on October 15, 2001.  Named as defendants in the Commission's Complaint are:  David Chen Yu, age 54, who currently resides in Monarch Beach, California.  Yu has been Quest's president since its incorporation in 1983, and at various times has held the title of compliance officer.&nbsp;  Quest, which has its principal office in Laguna Hills, California, and has been registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer since 1985 and with the National Association of Securities Dealers since 1986.  Quest currently has two branch offices located in California and employs approximately 500 registered representatives.  Quest's registered representatives are located throughout the United States, many in one-person offices.   The Commission Order arose from Quest's and Yu's failure to reasonably supervise John T. Nakoski, a Quest registered representative, with a view to preventing Nakoski's violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws.  In the Opinion accompanying the Commission order, the Commission found that Quest and Yu had abdicated their supervisory responsibility, and characterized their failure to supervise Nakoski as ""egregious"" and Yu's attitude towards his supervisory responsibilities as ""particularly disturbing.""  As a result, the Commission found that it was in the public interest that Yu be barred from associating with a broker-dealer in a supervisory capacity, provided that he may apply to become so associated after one year.  The Commission's Complaint charges that, despite the Commission Order, Yu continues to associate with Quest in a supervisory capacity by:  continuing to serve as Quest's president;&nbsp;  speaking with Quest registered representatives about subjects that Quest's compliance personnel are not willing to handle;&nbsp;  advising and supervising Quest's compliance personnel; and&nbsp;  being directly involved with the implementation of provisions of the Commission Order relating to the annual inspection of registered representatives not in Quest's main office or one of its branch offices.    The Complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop Yu from violating the Commission Order and to stop Yu and Quest from violating Section 15(b)(6)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Complaint also seeks civil penalties against Yu and Quest for their violations of the Exchange Act.

309,"On June 5, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ralph T. Iannelli of Santa Barbara, California and his company, Essex Capital Corporation, with engaging in a $80 million offering fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, between 2014 and 2017, Ianni raised more than $90 million from approximately 70 promissory note investors, using only a fraction of that money to pay back investors and banks and only approximately $39.4 million of its revenues to purchase equipment. The complaint alleges that, in order to maintain Essex's veneer of financial success and remain current on its obligations to its investors as a result of the sale of Essex securities, and to raise new investor funds, defendants: (i) resorted to a pattern and practicÂ method of making Ponzi-like payments to investors using other investors' funds; (ii) materially misrepresented Essexâs financial condition to an investment adviser whose clients eventually invested over $8 million in Essex and used only about $22.7 million for equipment purchases; and (iii) extended over a million dollars in personal guarantees on investor notes that Essex, given its actual net assets, had no hope of being able to honor. To avoid alerting investors about the financial losses and the risks of their investments, investors were encouraged to invest their money with Essex. Essex also used investor money borrowed from a local bank to finance its equipment leasing business, which was unprofitable at the time, leaving the company unable to meet its promised annual returns of between 8.5 and 11 percent. Investors were told that their funds would be used to fund the purchase of equipment and equipment for Essex to lease to startup companies with access to capital equipment such as wheelchairs and hospital beds. Instead, as alleged in the Complaint, instead of investing the money that it received from investors or bank lenders, it used it for personal loans and other personal expenses. In a parallel action, on March 31, 2019, a federal court in Santa Ana, Calif., entered a temporary restraining order against Essex from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a), 5(b), and 17 (b)(5) and 10(c)(2)(A) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10b-5 of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10a-1 thereunder.

According to the SEC's complaint, between 2014 and 2017, Essex Capital Corporation and its founder, Ralph T. Iannelli, made a series of false and misleading statements and illusory personal guarantees to registered investment advisers to induce them to invest millions of dollars of their clients' money in Essex's failing equipment leasing business.  The SEC alleges that Essex and Iannelli provided one investment adviser with fake financial statements that overstated Essex's assets by more than $20 million and falsely told another investment adviser that Essex would assign equipment leases to its clients when the same leases had already been pledged as collateral for bank loans.  The SEC's complaint further alleges that as Essex's finances deteriorated, the company resorted to frequent Ponzi-like payments, paying interest and principal to existing Essex investors with funds raised from newer investors.  At the same time, Iannelli allegedly paid himself millions of dollars in bonuses and siphoned millions of dollars out of Essex through interest-free loans with no maturity date.  According to the SEC, Iannelli personally owes the company over $6.4 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Iannelli and Essex with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  It seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains along with interest, monetary penalties, and permanent injunctions against Iannelli and Essex.  The SEC has also requested emergency relief against Defendants, including a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, and the appointment of a receiver over Essex.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Yolanda Ochoa, Marc J. Blau, and Rhoda Chang with assistance from the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations.

SEC OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF TO HALT ONGOING INSIDER TRADING SCHEME   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a former chemist employed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who allegedly engaged in insider trading in advance of at least 28 FDA drug approval decisions involving 20 publicly-traded companies. According to the SEC's amended complaint, filed in federal district court in Maryland on June 3 and unsealed yesterday, Andrew Liang, age 57, resides in Gaithersburg, Maryland. He has been employed as a chemist in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) since 1996. The SEC previously filed a settled enforcement action against Liang. Liang has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c).

Cheng Yi Liang, et al., Civil Action No. 8:11-cv-00819-RWT (D. Md.)  SEC CHARGES FDA CHEMIST WITH ADDITIONAL INSIDER TRADING  On June 2, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Greenbelt Division) in its insider trading action against Cheng Yi Liang, a chemist who worked at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The SEC&#8217;s amended complaint charges Liang with trading in advance of a 28th drug approval announcement and through an additional brokerage account in the name of a sixth nominee.  On March 29, 2011, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Maryland alleging that Liang illegally traded in advance of at least 27 public announcements about FDA drug approval decisions involving 19 publicly traded companies, garnering more than $3.6 million in illicit profits and avoided losses. Today&#8217;s amended complaint alleges that Liang traded in advance of a 28th announcement involving a 20th publicly-traded company, XenoPort, Inc.  As alleged in the amended complaint, Liang accessed a confidential FDA database that contained critical documents and information about the FDA&#8217;s review of Horizant, a drug developed by XenoPort to treat restless leg syndrome. Between January 6 and March 24, 2011, Liang accessed the confidential FDA database at least 52 times to monitor the status of the FDA&#8217;s review of Horizant. Then between February 22 and March 24, 2011, Liang purchased 43,000 shares of XenoPort in accounts in the name of three nominees: Hui Juan Chen, Zhongshan Chen, and Andrew Liang. On March 29, 2011, Liang was charged by the SEC and arrested by the criminal authorities in a parallel criminal investigation. One week later, on April 6, 2011, XenoPort announced that the FDA had approved Horizant, which caused XenoPort&#8217;s shares to rise 56% and resulted in imputed profits to Liang of over $126,000.  The amended complaint, in addition, alleges that Liang used an eighth brokerage account in the name of his 87-year-old father, Zhaozheng Liang, to trade beginning in January 2011 and in advance of the XenoPort and Clinical Data, Inc. announcements. The amended complaint also names Zhaozheng Liang as a relief defendant.

Levan, Civil Action No.: 12-cv-60082-BK (SDFL)  SEC SUES BANKATLANTIC BANCORP, INC. AND ITS CEO AND CHAIRMAN FOR DEFRAUDING INVESTORS IN $29.6 MILLION REAL ESTATE LOAN LOSS CASE   The Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the bank of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and its Chairman and CEO, Chairman, Alvio Banca, for defrauding investors by: not timely disclosing a bad loan trend regarding extended and downgraded loans in its commercial residential real estate land acquisition and development portfolio (the ""Commercial Residential""), selectively disclosing problem loans; and engaging in improper accounting treatment of loans they were attempting to sell.  According to the Commission's complaint, on October 26, 2007, the Bank of Atlantic, a federally chartered savings bank, announced in a Form 10-K filing and earnings call that its Commercial Residential portfolio would suffer a loss of $28 million, or 37% of the value of its total portfolio. The complaint also alleges that on the basis of this material misstatements and omissions, Bank Atlantic materially overstated its net loss by about 51%.  As a result of these actions and the failure to timely disclose the nature and extent of a problem loan portfolio, which is a key driver of Bankatlantic's financial performance, Bâs share price dropped 37%. The Commission also charged that the loan loss was due almost entirely to an increase in Bank-Atlantic&#8217;s provision for loan losses associated with impaired loans. This portfolio consisted primarily of large tracts of land intended for development into single family housing and condominiums. In a Land Acquisition and Development (LAD) loan, borrowers purchased land and conducted horizontal development such as building utilities and roads. When an interest reserve account was depleted and borrowers were forced to restock it with new amounts of money, they realized losses of more than $50 million. As the complaint alleges, by the end of third quarter of 2007 the lender had reduced its loan-","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22229 / January 18, 2012  SEC V. BANKATLANTIC BANCORP., INC. AND ALAN LEVAN (UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, CASE NO. 0:12-CV60082, FILED JANUARY 18, 2012)  On January 18, 2012, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. (at the time of its misconduct the holding company for BankAtlantic, one of Florida&#8217;s largest banks) (&#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;the bank&#8221;) and its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Alan Levan, with securities fraud intended to hide growing problems early in the financial crisis.  The SEC&#8217;s civil complaint alleges that (1) Bancorp and Levan made misleading statements in public filings and earnings calls regarding the deteriorating state of a large portion of Bancorp&#8217;s commercial real estate portfolio in the first two quarters of 2007; and (2) Bancorp and Levan improperly accounted for loans they were trying to sell from this portfolio in late 2007 to minimize Bancorp&#8217;s losses.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Bancorp and Levan knew that a large portion of the commercial residential portfolio was deteriorating early in 2007 due to the fact that many of the loans had required extensions because of the borrowers&#8217; inability to meet their loan obligations.  A number of loans were kept &#8220;current&#8221; only by extending the terms or replenishment of the interest reserves from an increase in the loan principal.  Levan knew this negative information in part from participating in the bank&#8217;s Major Loan Committee (which approved the extensions and principal increases).  Bancorp and Levan were also aware that many of the loans had been internally downgraded to non-passing status, indicating the bank was deeply concerned about the loans.    Despite this knowledge, Bancorp&#8217;s public filings in the first two quarters of 2007 made only generic warnings of what may occur in the future if Florida&#8217;s real estate downturn continued and failed to disclose the downward trend already occurring in its own portfolio.  The steady deterioration of this portfolio constituted a known trend of the type that should have been disclosed in the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis (&#8220;MD&amp;A&#8221;) of Bancorp&#8217;s periodic filings, which were signed by Levan.  Levan also made misleading statements to investors about the portfolio during earnings calls in the same time period.  Bancorp finally acknowledged the problem in the third quarter of 2007 by announcing a large unexpected loss.      The SEC also alleges that Bancorp and Levan attempted to sell a number of the deteriorating loans after this announcement but failed to account for them properly as being &#8220;held for sale&#8221; as required by GAAP because doing so would have required Bancorp to write them down, incurring immediate additional losses.  As a result of this scheme, Bancorp understated its net loss by more than 10% in its 2007 Form 10-K.    The complaint charges Bancorp with violating, and Levan with violating and aiding and abetting, the antifraud provisions in Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Bancorp with violating, and Levan with aiding and abetting, the reporting provisions in Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; and Levan with violating the falsification of books and records, lying to accountants, and certification provisions in Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14(a) thereunder.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties, and also seeks an officer and director bar against Levan.

Montroll and his company, BitFunder, with defrauding investors by misappropriating their funds and failing to disclose a cyberattack that resulted in the theft of more than 6,000 bitcoins.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, from December 2012 through November 2013, Montrolling operated Bitfunder as an unregistered securities exchange through which users could create, offer, buy and sell virtual ""shares"" of various virtual currency-related enterprises in exchange for bitcoins, which were then used to pay personal and business expenses, and to replenish bitcoins that had been stolen from the WeExchange wallet. The complaint further alleges that, over the course of five weeks, a group of Bitdefender users engaged in a Cyberattack on the BitDefender's platform, resulting in an estimated $8.5 million in bitcoins being stolen. In a parallel action, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief to halt the alleged theft and freeze the assets of the two defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations.Â  The court also froze the defendants' assets and ordered the repatriation of all assets held by the Commission and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida.The SEC alleges in its complaint that from at least July 2013 until the end of November 2014, Defendants, in connection with their alleged fraudulent conduct, misused investor funds to make payments to investors, including for personal expenses and for other purposes, such as to purchase shares of bitcoins in secondary market transactions. As a result of this conduct by Defendants and their companies, bitcoins were taken out of public view and used as a hedge fund to repay earlier investors. Without providing any evidence, defendants consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty, to be determined at a later date by a court hearing on February 20, 2019, for a total of $1.2 million.

John Hyun Joon Min and Dime Financial Group LLC, Case No: 09-CV-042 (W.D. Cal. filed Mar 31 2009)  SEC OBTAINS EMERGENCY ASSET FREEZE TO HALT $6 MILLION FRAUDULENT INVESTMENT SCHEME  The Securities &amp; Exchange &#160; Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of a Seattle-based company and its principal, who allegedly defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors out of more than $600,000 through a fraudulent foreign exchange investment scheme. The SEC's complaint, filed in the Western District of Washington, alleges that Min, of King County, Wash., and his company, dime financial group LLC d/b/a DIME, raised over a half-million dollars from more 60 investors by telling them that their funds would be invested in low-risk, high-return foreign currency investments. In reality, Min fraudulently misappropriated investor funds for his own personal use, a failed film venture, and to finance his lavish lifestyle, including spending about $1.4 million on his personal life expenses and $370,00 in legal expenses. According to the SEC, the defendants induced investors to invest with them by, among other things, falsely telling investors that the fund had historical annual returns as high as 800%, and sending quarterly account statements falsely portraying a steady positive return to continuing investors. Min also allegedly lied to boost their credibility, misleading investors about Min's trading expertise, his licenses and the existence of the fictitious ""Advisory Board,"" which Min falsely claimed included a Securities industry attorney. As alleged, in actuality, these statements were false, as Min did not have a registered broker-dealer in operation and Min was not registered with the Commission as required by the federal securities laws. To the extent that defendants did put investor proceeds into the foreign market, they did so using the same pooled brokerage accounts as used for other investors, to which investors were directed to contribute funds.

Filed March 31, 2009)  SEC CHARGES SEATTLE-AREA FIRM IN MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR SCAM TARGETING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY AND CHARITABLE INVESTORS  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged John H. Min of Tacoma, Wash., and his company Dime Financial Group LLC for raising more than $6 million in a fraudulent investment scheme that targeted churches, church members and senior citizens. The SEC alleges that Min misled some investors into believing their money would support Third World charitable causes while in fact spending the funds on his own lavish lifestyle and on failed high-risk investments.  According to the SEC's complaint, Min associated himself with a tight-knit religious and philanthropic community in the Pacific Northwest, creating a not-for-profit entity to attract charitable investors who believed that their investments would support certain Third Word aid groups, such as a charity supporting Bolivian widows and orphans. Min lured other investors by telling them that his trading expertise allowed him to make annual returns as high as 800 percent, and by touting Dime as a safe, low-risk investment for retirees' savings. The SEC alleges that Min and Dime deceived more than 60 investors since 2005 into buying interests in Dime's purportedly prosperous investment program.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Min told investors that he would use their money to trade in the foreign currency exchange (Forex) market. The SEC alleges that Min instead misappropriated about $1.4 million of investors' funds to finance a lavish lifestyle that included a $70,000 Mercedes, expensive vacations, and private school tuition for his children. Min also illicitly used investor funds to bankroll a failed film venture about evangelical churches, and to pay expenses relating to the operation of the fraud. When Min did actually invest the funds, his trading record was abysmal. He lost more than $5 million on the Forex market, according to the SEC's complaint.  To conceal the fraud, Min sent investors false account statements reporting high returns, while he was actually depleting the entire investment pool through theft and trading losses. Min lied about his and Dime's credentials by, among other things, falsely telling investors that Dime was supervised by an ""Advisory Board"" populated by accomplished individuals.  The SEC's litigated action against Min and Dime charges both with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil monetary penalties, and disgorgement against both Min and Dime.  Separately, today the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington (USAO) unsealed an indictment charging Min with criminal violations based on the same misconduct.

SEC CHARGES FORMER CALIFORNIA HEDGE FUND MANAGER WITH FRAUDULENT SCHEME  On May 15, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an emergency court order freezing the assets of two Las Vegas, Nevada-based hedge fund managers and their companies.  The SEC alleges that, from approximately February 2006 to the present, defendant and his company have raised at least $14.1 million from over 100 investors in the U. S. and Canada through the sale of interests in a proprietary software program that they claimed to use to trade futures, specifically, e-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures. The defendants claimed that the returns paid to investors represented trading profits, and that Driver generated substantial profits from trading. In reality, Driver operated a Ponzi scheme, using only $3.7 million of investor funds for trading and misappropriating $10 million to pay personal expenses, including over $469,000 in cash withdrawals and $1,1.2 million for his own personal bank account.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Gordon A. Driver (""Driver"") and his company Axcess Automation, LLC (""Axcess"") raised $14.1 million from investors since approximately February 2006 by promising them a weekly return of up to 5 percent from trading in futures. The SEC alleges that Driver operated Axcess as a Ponzi scheme and misappropriated over $1 million to pay his personal expenses. The court order obtained by the SEC freezes the assets of both the firm and Driver, who resides in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Hamilton, Ontario.  Specifically, the SEC's complaint alleges that Driver and Axcess represented to the investors that their funds would be used to trade futures using a ""proprietary software program"" that Driver developed and that they would receive returns of 1 percent to 5 percent per week from the trading. According to the complaint, Driver and Axcess actually used only $3.7 million of the $14.1 million raised for futures trading and lost nearly all of it in trading. The complaint further alleges that Driver and Axcess operated a Ponzi scheme by using $10.7 million to pay investors and another $1.1 million to pay Driver's personal expenses.  The SEC alleges that Driver and Axcess have violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court order obtained by the SEC temporarily enjoins Driver and Axcess from future violations of these provisions, freezes their assets, prevents the destruction of documents; grants expedited discovery; and requires them to provide accountings. The Commission also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and financial penalties against both defendants.

According to the SEC's complaint, from at least January 2008 through November 2014, he exploited his network of friends, business associates and friends to recruit investors for ISc, a Wisconsin-based insurance brokerage business.  The complaint alleges that, in soliciting investors to invest, and using new investor funds to pay returns to existing investors, Holzbouter told some investors that their investments would be placed in a separate investment account at the company and that they could withdraw their funds at any time. He also allegedly claimed that investors could use the money to ""grow IS"" its business, or expand its operations through the acquisition of other insurance agencies. But none of the forgoing representations was true. Instead of investing the investors' money as he claimed he would, as promised, it was used to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors and to repay debt owed by other investors.

SEC CHARGES LOS ANGELES-BASED FINANCIAL COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPALS WITH FRAUD IN $10.8 MILLION HIGH-YIELD INVESTMENT SCHEME   The Securities &amp; Exchange and Options Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against Las Vegas-based Malom Group AG (""Malom"") and its principals, Martin U. Schläpfer and Hans-Jurg Lips. The Commission's complaint alleges that, between 2009 and 2011, the defendants participated in two advance-fee high-yield investment scams, one of which involved a purported ""joint venture"" offering, and the other involving a structured note offering.  According to the complaint, from approximately August 2009 to August 2011 the scheme involved two types of investment contracts:  a joint venture agreement and a ""structured note transaction.""  This offering targeted investors seeking to generate funding from high yield international trading programs that would yield extraordinary returns (e.g., 100% in a single day) through risk-free transactions utilizing substantial assets, such as a bank statement or ""proof of funds"" bank letter, purportedly showing that the investor had tens to hundreds of millions of dollars available in bank accounts and that he had the ability to use those funds to purchase and sell structured notes, in some cases supported by Brazilian sovereign bonds from the 1970s that were publicly disclaimed as worthless by the Brazilian government. In connection with the joint ventures, however, they did not use the fees collected from investors to underwrite the offerings, nor did they use any of the funds raised to make the structured transactions.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, alleges that between 2009 and 2011 Erwin, through Joint Venture Solutions, promoted investments in Malom, offered Malom's securities to prospective investors, and acted as an intermediary between investors and Malom.  The defendants' efforts induced at least five investors to pay Malom over $2.5 million to enter into agreements with Malom.  The SEC alleges that while the defendants received commissions based upon a percentage of the amount of investor funds raised, the investors they recruited lost all of their invested funds.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Erwin and Joint Venture Solutions, Inc. violated the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, from 2012 to 2017, Ali and REVO entered into several sham transactions with purportedly independent companies and then publicized the transactions as being highly lucrative. The complaint alleges that these transactions were not arm's-length because Ali had close personal and financial connections to these companies. In addition, as alleged, each of the fraudulent transactions collectively conveyed the false impression that ReVO had legitimate profit potential as a result of entering into the deals with independent third parties and that the deal was worth $15 million. As further detailed in this matter, Revo and Ali failed to disclose that Ali's daughter and girlfriend were officers and directors of one of those companies, a third-party vendor that had no legitimate basis for projecting revenue from the purported transactions. Finally, according to court documents, in December 2012, after being sued by a press release announcing the acquisition of Greenwood Finance Group, LLC, Rua Ali was quoted in a public filing stating that ""revo is going to acquire Greenwood from Rainco.""  The SEC alleges in its complaint that Rada Ali misrepresented to investors that his daughter was the majority owner and director of that company, when in fact the company was not earning any revenue at the time and did not have anywhere near $1 million in assets.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, in mid-2007, while in possession of confidential non-public information about the acquisition of Restoration hardware by private equity investors Catterton Partners and C.A. Lusardi, a senior financial planning supervisor at Good Guys, learned that the deal was going to be announced at a premium price and that it would generate nearly $30 million in illicit profits. The complaint further alleges Rivarex and his friends Emmanuel and Lucian Lucio Axiasq (a/k/a Emmanuel Axioq), a resident of Millbrae, California and a friend of Riverex's, were privy to the confidential information and were specifically ordered to limit their purchases to 10,000 shares. In fact, according to a sworn statement filed with the complaint, all of the defendants used the information to buy stock before the announcement to make profits of $29,539 and $4,398, respectively, and to sell their entire position of stock on the day after the public announcement.

Cal. filed October 7, 2008)  SEC Charges Former Vice President at Restoration Hardware and Three Friends in Insider Trading Scheme  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former vice president of national home furnishing retailer Restoration Hardware with insider trading for tipping three friends that the company was about to be acquired, enabling them to make more than $900,000 in unlawful profits when public announcement of the subsequent merger caused the stock price to soar.  The SEC alleges that Ciriaco ""Eric"" Rivor of Millbrae, Calif., who was Vice President of Treasury at Corte Madera, Calif.-based Restoration Hardware, learned in mid-2007 that the company was about to be acquired by a private equity firm at a substantial premium. Rivor allegedly passed the confidential, non-public information to friends Emmanuel Axiaq of San Carlos, Calif., and Steven Lusardi of San Jose. Rivor told Emmanuel Axiaq to pass the information to his father, Francis Axiaq of Millbrae. The SEC alleges that Rivor instructed his friends to limit the size of their Restoration Hardware stock purchases to prevent detection.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, Emmanuel Axiaq and Lusardi complied with Rivor's instruction to limit the size of their stock purchases.

When Restoration Hardware publicly announced the acquisition on Nov. 8, 2007, its stock price soared more than 140 percent, from $2.68 to $6.44 per share. The SEC's complaint alleges that Emmanuel Axiaq and Lusardi profited by $29,539 and $4,398, respectively, on their stock purchases. The announcement gave Francis Axiaq an illicit potential profit of nearly $900,000.

EXECUTIVE WITH ACCOUNTING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECOND HALF PERPETRATOR'S OFFERING OF PEN STOCK  On January 31, the Securities &amp; Exhange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United Kingdom's federal district court against former Capital Consulting Corporation, Inc. (""Capital Consulting""), a Nevada corporation that was created as a shell company in 1996 under the name of UCC.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, in two separate private transactions, defendant, a resident of Austin, Texas, sold the common stock of Stinger Systems to persons who subsequently resold the stock to the public via quotation in Pink Sheets. At no time during any of these sales was a registration statement in effect or filed by either the company or its parent company, and no valid exemption from registration was available to those entities. The Complaint further alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the federal securities laws, which prohibit the sale of penny stock through the issuance of a stock without a broker-dealer's approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations, St.inger agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty. In a parallel action, on January 29, 2009, U. S. District Judge William H. Jeffries entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of all defendants and appointing a receiver over all of them, barring the alteration or destruction of documents, prohibiting the destruction or alteration of any documents or records, imposing an officer-and-director bar and ordering the payment of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a conduct-based injunction against the Defendants, for a period of five years, subject to court approval; and prohibiting them from acting as an unregistered broker, dealer, distributor, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer or municipal advisor in connection with any offering or registration proceeding involving the issuer's issuance or purchase of securities.

Douglas Murrell (""Murrell"").  Murrell is a resident of Austin, Texas, and is the owner and operator of Capital Consulting Group.  The Complaint alleges that in two separate private transactions from July 2004 through   September 2004, Murrell sold the common stock of Stinger Systems, Inc. (""Stinger""), formerly United Consulting Corporation (""UCC"") to persons who resold the stock to the public via quotation in the Pink Sheets.  The Complaint further alleges that at no time during the stock sales was a registration statement in effect or filed by Stinger or UCC, and no valid exemption from registration was available for these entities.  The Complaint also alleges that on or about September 23, 2004, Murrell represented to Stinger's counsel that his son controlled UCC at the time of both private sales to obtain a legal opinion that the shares sold in both transactions should be issued without restrictive legend.  In fact, Murrell controlled UCC at the time of both private transactions.  The Complaint further alleges that, as a result of the fraudulent sales transactions by Murrell and others, 181,000 Stinger shares were sold through the Pink Sheets during the first two weeks of public trading, which represented approximately 18% of Stinger's public float, and generated net sales proceeds of over $1.044 million.  On February 4, 2008, the Honorable Lee Yeakel, United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, entered a final judgment against Murrell, enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The court also ordered Murrell to pay disgorgement of $55,000, and prejudgment interest of $13,178.95.  Further, the court ordered Murrell to be permanently barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock, and from inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.  Murrell consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the Commission's Complaint.

Fla., filed April 25, 2005)  On April 25, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed an emergency civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Bio-Heal Laboratories, Inc. (Bio-Heal) in connection with its fraudulent issuance of Bio-Heal stock, and to recover approximately $10 million in proceeds generated from the sale of the illegally issued shares.     The Commission's Complaint alleges that Bio-Heal is a publicly-held company quoted on the Over-The-Counter Pink Sheets that claims to develop topical natural healing products in Nicaragua.  The Complaint alleges that in February 2005, Bio-Heal issued 12 million shares of its stock to Relief Defendants MRMG Holdings (MRMG), Kess Associates, Inc. (Kess) and ICOR, Inc.  These shares were issued without a restrictive legend based on an attorney opinion letter claiming that the 12 million shares were exempt from registration with the Commission pursuant to Rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities Act.  According to the Complaint, Bio-Heal is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and, therefore, is not entitled to use Rule 504 of Regulation D as an exemption from registration.  The Complaint further alleges that the attorney opinion letter is a fraud and that the telephone and facsimile numbers on it actually belong to a legal aid service which does not employ the attorney providing the opinion letter, nor does it furnish securities opinion letters.   The Complaint alleges that MRMG and Kess transferred their Bio-Heal shares to two other Relief Defendants located offshore, Bela Enterprises, LLC, and Gibson Island Enterprises, LLC, who reaped more than $10 million in profits by dumping Bio-Heal shares while the stock was being touted to investors through the Internet.  On April 8, 2005, the Commission suspended trading in Bio-Heal stock.  The Commission filed its action to permanently restrain and enjoin Bio-Heal from continuing to illegally issue its shares and to restrain and enjoin Relief Defendants from trading in these illegal shares.     The Commission's Complaint charges Bio-Heal with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

McCloskey, Rance C. Miles, Luis E. Vallejo and Daniel Harris for engaging in insider trading in the securities of Dean Foods Company (""Dean Foods"") in advance of the April 5, 2001 announcement that Suiza Foods Corporation would merge with Dean Foods.  The Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that McCloskey and Miles were officers of a dairy business that had entered into a confidential milk supply contract with Dean Foods in early 2001.  According to the complaint, McCloskey and Miles obtained material nonpublic information from Dean Foods which they used to purchase Dean Foods securities the day before the Dean Foods-Suiza Foods merger announcement and to tip others including Vallejo, McCloskey's long-time friend, and Harris, Miles' broker.  Collectively, the four defendants realized illegal profits totaling $113,801.   The Commission alleges that McCloskey and Miles received the last piece of material nonpublic information on April 4, 2001, when they were given the ""green light"" to make public their previously confidential milk supply agreement.  McCloskey, in light of this and other information known to him, concluded that this meant the Suiza Foods-Dean Foods merger was ""coming down.""  After receiving the information, McCloskey purchased 3,000 shares of Dean Foods stock on margin for $97,500.  McCloskey also tipped others, including his long-time friend Luis Vallejo.  Vallejo purchased 7,000 shares of Dean Foods stock the same day for $229,170.  According to the complaint, Miles also purchased 500 shares of Dean Foods stock and 250 out-of-the-money call options contracts for $43,050 after receiving the information about the ""green light"" from McCloskey.  Miles also tipped others, including his broker, Harris.  Harris purchased 100 shares of Dean Foods stock for $3,259.  He also tipped one of his clients, recommending that he sell short Suiza Foods stock.   After the public announcement of the merger on April 5, 2001, Dean Foods stock increased from its April 4, 2001 close of $32.50 to as high as $38.80 on April 5, 2001, or a 19% increase.  Following the announcement, the four individuals sold their Dean Foods securities and realized substantial illegal profits.  McCloskey sold his stock on April 5, 2001, realizing one-day illegal profits of $15,900.  Miles sold his Dean Foods stock and options between April 5 and April 11, 2001, earning illegal profits of $60,530.  Vallejo sold his stock on April 5, 2001, earning $36,830 in illegal profits.  Harris sold his stock on April 5, 2001, realizing one-day profits of $541.  McCloskey, Miles, and Harris each tipped others.  Collectively, the tippees (other than Vallejo) earned $10,799.05.

Harris has consented to pay $624.00, representing one dollar in disgorgement and a one-time civil penalty of $623 on his own profits and those of his tippee.  In addition, Harris has agreed, based upon the anticipated entry of the injunction in this matter, to a Commission Order barring him from association with any broker or dealer with the right to reapply after two years.

According to the complaint, Ability's then-CEO, Anatole Hurin, and CTO, Alexander â both of whom reside in Israel, misled and withheld critical information from the shareholders, including in proxy materials sent to investors, in order to convince them to vote for the proposed merger between Ability and Cambridge, a U.S. publicly-traded Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC).  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles on June 17, 2018, Huron, who resides in Caesarea, has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder. The settlement is subject to approval by the court. In a related administrative proceeding, on August 13, 2020, Cambridge and Ability consented to an administrative order barring them from serving as officers or directors of public companies and from association with any officer or director of any publicly traded company, except as required by law. Ability, which is a private Israeli company that sells cell phone and satellite interception products to end-of-line government agencies, was previously charged with violating the antifraud, issuer reporting, books-and-records, internal controls, record-keeping and reporting provisions of those federal securities laws. It is also charged that, as part of its settlement with the Commission, it was also required to pay a $50,000 civil penalty to be determined at a later date by a court-","The SEC on Tuesday charged Ability Inc., an Israel-based intelligence communications company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, and two of its top executives with defrauding shareholders of a Florida-based special purpose acquisition company, or ""SPAC,"" a company formed to raise capital for a merger or acquisition within a set timeframe.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Ability, CEO Anatoly Hurgin, and chief technology officer Alexander Vladimir Aurovsky, defrauded SPAC shareholders who voted in favor of a merger between Ability and the SPAC, Cambridge Capital Acquisition Corp., in December 2015.  According to the complaint, if Cambridge had not consummated a merger by December 2015, it would have been required, without an extension of the SPAC term, to return all of the capital to its shareholders.  To convince shareholders to vote in favor of the merger proposal, the defendants allegedly lied to SPAC shareholders about Ability's business prospects, including Ability's purported ownership of a new ""game-changing"" cellular interception product, ULIN, Ability's so-called backlog of orders from its largest customer, a police agency in Latin America, Ability's lack of actual purchase orders backing its backlog, and Ability's pipeline of possible future orders from customers.  As alleged in the complaint, Ability and the two executives profited from the merger, with Ability receiving approximately $19 million, and Hurgin and Aurovsky each receiving approximately $9 million, plus $6 million each in put options, while Cambridge shareholders lost $60 million.  The SEC's complaint charges defendants with violations of the antifraud and proxy statement provisions of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the complaint charges Ability and Hurgin with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder, and Aurovsky with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants, and also seeks an officer and director bar against Hurgin.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer T. Calabrese and supervised by Ansu N. Banerjee and John W. Berry.  The litigation will be conducted by Donald Searles and supervised by Amy J. Longo of the Los Angeles Regional Office.  For further information, see Release No. 33-10651 (June 20, 2019)",0.5909,0.5728

Cassidy, Edward O'Connor, and Scott Connor, Civil Action No.: 07-CV-1164 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES FORMER COMMODITIES TRADING EXECUTIVES WITH FRAUD  On May 3, 2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging three former traders at BMO Capital Markets Corp. (""BMO"") with fraud in connection with a long-running scheme to overvalue the company's natural gas options trading portfolio by deliberately ""mismarking"" trading positions for which market prices were unavailable.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, in May 2007, one of the traders engaged in this fraudulent scheme by artificially inflating the value of his trading book by regularly recording inflated values that were then purportedly validated by Optionable, Inc., a publicly-traded commodities brokerage firm where the trader worked. The complaint also charges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(A) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 14a-2 thereunder and with aiding and abetting the Defendants' violations of Section 20(e) the Securities Act and Sections 13 (a), 13 and 15(d) in Section 17(A)(1), and (2) under Section 13 of The Securities Code of Conduct (Securities Act) (the ""Defendants""). The Complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and officer and director bars against all defendants, as well as the imposition of penny stock bars and an officer-and-director bar against each defendant. In a parallel action, on May 5, 2006, a federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y. entered a temporary restraining order against Lee from violating the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions (Section 13, Section 5) or (ii) Section 15 (A.B.D.). The Court also entered an order freezing the assets of Lee and the other defendants' assets and appointing a receiver to marshal the funds of each of them and to preserve","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20811 / November 18, 2008  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2901 / November 18, 2008  SEC v. David Lee, et al., Civil Action No. 08-CIV-9961 (GBD) (SDNY)  SEC Charges Banker And Brokerage Executives With Multimillion Dollar Financial Fraud  On November 18, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging four individuals with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to overvalue the commodity derivatives trading portfolio at Bank of Montreal (""BMO""), and thereby inflate BMO's publicly reported financial results. The defendants include a former senior derivatives trader at BMO and the top two senior executive officers of Optionable, Inc. (""Optionable""), a publicly traded commodities brokerage firm.  The defendants named in the Commission's complaint are:  David Lee (""Lee""), age 36, resides in New Jersey. Lee was a natural gas options trader employed by BMO Capital Markets Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMO and a registered broker-dealer, until he resigned on May 15, 2007. From 2001 through 2004, Lee was a Vice President of BMO's Commodity Derivatives Group, the unit through which BMO traded commodity derivatives. In 2005, he was promoted to Managing Director of that group.  Kevin P. Cassidy (""Cassidy""), age 49, resides in Bedford Hills, New York. Cassidy was one of Optionable's founders and served as Vice Chairman of Optionable's board of directors until he resigned on May 12, 2007. Except for the period from March 2004 to October 2005, he was also Optionable's CEO throughout the relevant period.  Edward O'Connor (""O'Connor""), age 55, resides in Briarcliff Manor, New York. O'Connor was one of Optionable's founders and since 2001, he has served as President and a director of Optionable. From March 2004 through October 2005, he was also Optionable's CEO and Treasurer.  Scott Connor (""Connor""), age 31, resides in Rye, New York. Connor was employed by Optionable as a commodities broker until May 2007.  The Commission's complaint specifically alleges as follows:  Lee fraudulently overvalued BMO's portfolio of natural gas options by deliberately ""mismarking"" trading positions for which market prices were unavailable. Lee recorded inflated values that were then purportedly validated by Optionable, which held itself out to BMO and the public as a legitimate provider of independent derivatives valuation services. In fact, Cassidy, O'Connor and Connor schemed with Lee to have Optionable simply rubber-stamp whatever inflated values Lee recorded. After the scheme was discovered, BMO restated its financial results by reducing net income for the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year by approximately $237 million Canadian dollars ($204 million USD), which reflects a 68% overstatement of BMO's net income for that quarter.  BMO was Optionable's largest customer, and BMO trades accounted for as much as 60% of Optionable's commodity brokerage business. Lee's trading accounted for virtually all of BMO's business with Optionable. As a result, Optionable's management, led by Cassidy, was willing to do whatever it took to keep Lee satisfied. When market prices were unavailable, BMO's risk management personnel sought to verify the accuracy of BMO's commodity derivatives traders' valuations of their positions, or their ""marks,"" by obtaining supposedly independent valuations, or ""quotes,"" for those positions from one or more third parties. During the relevant period, Optionable was the primary source of the third-party quotes that BMO used to validate Lee's marks. Lee provided his marks directly to Cassidy, O'Connor or Connor, who then simply forwarded Lee's marks, virtually unchanged, to BMO's risk management department as if they were Optionable's independent quotes. At first, Lee used this ""u-turn"" scheme to boost his trading profits and incentive compensation, but in 2006, the market turned against Lee and he used the scheme to hide substantial trading losses. In May 2007, BMO concluded that due to the Optionable scheme and other positions that Lee had also mismarked, Lee's trading book was overvalued by an aggregate total of $680 million (CAD) since the beginning of BMO's fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.  Cassidy and O'Connor also defrauded Optionable's public shareholders by concealing Optionable's role in the scheme. Optionable's periodic reports touted the synergistic benefits of the derivatives valuation services that Optionable purportedly provided to multiple brokerage clients, but those reports, which Cassidy and O'Connor signed, never disclosed that BMO was the principal client for whom those ""services"" were performed and that the ""valuation services"" provided to BMO were a sham designed to defraud BMO. In addition, Cassidy and O'Connor defrauded the New York Mercantile Exchange (""NYMEX"") by selling over $10 million of their own Optionable stock to NYMEX in April 2007. Both Cassidy and O'Connor represented to NYMEX that Optionable's periodic reports were materially accurate, but they never disclosed anything about their scheme with Lee to defraud the shareholders of BMO, Optionable's largest customer. On May 9, 2007, one day after BMO announced that it had placed Lee on leave and suspended its business relationship with Optionable, Optionable issued an announcement stating that the suspension would have an adverse effect on Optionable's business. Optionable's stock price fell almost 40% that day, from $4.64 to $2.81 per share, and dropped to below 50 cents per share one week later after Cassidy's prior criminal record was disclosed in press reports.  All four defendants are charged with committing violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder; and with aiding and abetting BMO's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-16. The complaint further charges Cassidy, O'Connor and Connor with aiding and abetting Optionable's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13, and also charges Cassidy and O'Connor with violating Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. As to each defendant, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The complaint also seeks an order barring Cassidy and O'Connor from acting as officers or directors of a public company.  The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (""USAO""), the New York County District Attorney's Office (""NYCDA""), and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") also filed parallel criminal and regulatory charges today arising from the same conduct that is alleged in the Commission's complaint. Lee pled guilty to parallel criminal charges filed by the USAO and the NYCDA. In connection with his guilty plea, Lee agreed to pay a total of $4.41 million in forfeiture.  Lee has agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission's claims for disgorgement and civil penalties against Lee, and all of its claims against the other three defendants, remain pending.  The Commission's investigation is continuing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the USAO, NYCDA, CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

333,"U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19855 / September 18, 2004  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Carl R. Rose, Marvin M. Barnwell, Stacey J. Blake, et al., Civil Action No H-04-CV-2799, United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division)  SEC CHARGES FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH INSIDER TRADING  On September 17, the Securities &amp;Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Houston, Texas against Harris D. Ballow, a former stockbroker, and four other individuals for their roles in a massive insider trading scheme that manipulated the stock of two publicly traded companies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U. S. District court for South Texas, alleges that, during 1999 and most of 2000, James E. Cannan, Jr., of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida and his company, EpicEdge, Inc., engaged in heavy trading designed to artificially inflate the value of the stocks and interfere with the supply and demand for those stocks. The complaint further alleges Cannans, Sr. of Fort Worth, Tex., was the controlling shareholder of Epic Edge and that he and others used undisclosed control over the company and its stock to manipulate the market for these stocks, causing the price to fall from $25 to $15, which was approximately 84% of all the unrestricted public float in both companies' stock at the time. According to the complaint the defendants' manipulations were designed in part to create the illusion of artificial volume and increase demand. As a result of their manipulative actions, investors were able to profit by purchasing and selling shares of these companies at a profit, rather than experiencing the loss of investor money as they otherwise would have been. In addition to manipulating the prices of those stock, Cannasby and Leaver aided and abetted the scheme by selling stock that was not in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (also known as ""GAAP"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and by engaging in manipulative trading in violation of Sections 5(a), (1) and (2) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(d)(1), and 14(e) the Exchange Act and Rules 10a-1, 13d-2 and 12b2-3 there under.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No.  18780 / July 12, 2004  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Carl R. Rose, et al., Civil Action No. H-04-CV-2799 (S.D. Texas)  On July 9, 2004, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Harris D. ""Butch"" Ballow and twelve other individuals, alleging that they carried out a manipulation of two stocks, EpicEdge, Inc., and EVTC, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Ballow orchestrated the manipulation, and the other defendants include three associates of Ballow (Hector J. Garcia, Marvin M. ""Mike"" Barnwell, and Frank H. Moss) two former officers of EVTC (George J. Cannan, Sr. and David A. Keener), two former officers of EpicEdge (Charles H. Leaver and Carl R. Rose), three registered representatives at securities firms where Ballow and his associates traded the stocks (Mark K. Menzel, Earl Shawn Casias, and George J. Cannan, Jr.) and two other securities industry professionals (Lawrence A. Clasby, an investment adviser, and Stacey J. Blake, a former registered representative). All defendants are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Defendant Clasby is also charged with violating the antifraud provisions in Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (""Advisers Act"").  Defendants Ballow, Garcia, Barnwell, Cannan, Sr., Cannan, Jr., Menzel, Casias, Clasby and Blake are charged with violating Rule 101 or 102 of Regulation M, an antimanipulation rule that prohibits persons involved in a stock distribution from purchasing stock during the distribution.  Defendants Ballow, Garcia, Barnwell, Moss, and Cannan, Sr. are charged with violating the stock ownership reporting provisions in Sections 13(d)(1) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder.  Defendants Ballow, Garcia, Barnwell, Moss, Cannan, Sr., Keener, Cannan, Jr., Menzel, Casias, Clasby and Blake are charged with violating the securities registration provisions in Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Defendants Cannan, Sr., Keener, Leaver, and Rose are charged with aiding and abetting violations by EVTC or EpicEdge of the periodic reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 12b-20 thereunder.  Defendants Garcia and Blake are charged with acting as unregistered broker-dealers, in violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The stock prices for EVTC and EpicEdge followed similar trajectories after Ballow, a four-time convicted felon, acting with the approval of management of each company, allegedly began systematically acquiring undisclosed but significant interests in the companies in 1999.  According to the complaint, Ballow, acting largely through off-shore corporations, engaged in heavy trading designed to create artificial volume in the stocks and interfere with the true supply and demand for the stocks.  Both stocks rose sharply throughout most of 2000, then simultaneously collapsed in September 2000 when Ballow was no longer able to support the prices.  The collapse not only hurt investors, but also the broker-dealers who made large margin loans to Ballow's off-shore companies and to Cannan, Sr. The complaint alleges that the scheme began when Ballow and Moss engineered a merger between a private company owned by Rose and a public shell, creating EpicEdge.  EpicEdge then issued new stock to Ballow, registered on Form S-8, which put Ballow in control of the EpicEdge public float.  Ballow then gained control over EVTC by acquiring restricted stock and used his EpicEdge stock to finance massive purchases of EVTC stock, enabling Ballow to take control of the market for EVTC stock as well.  Cannan, Sr. helped the scheme by purchasing large amounts of EpicEdge stock in the market, using his own EVTC stock as collateral, thereby propping up the value of Ballow's EpicEdge stock and enabling Ballow to continue buying EVTC stock. Garcia and Barnwell participated in the scheme by ordering trades through accounts controlled by Ballow at various brokerage firms and by selling EpicEdge and EVTC stock owned by Ballow in off-market transactions designed to raise cash for Ballow without depressing the price of the stocks.  Blake and Clasby also participated in these off-market sales,  promoted the stocks to friends and, in Clasby's case, clients.  Keener, Leaver, and Rose provided Ballow with information necessary to carry out the schemes.  Cannan, Jr. and Menzel executed trades for Ballow and Cannan family members, and Casias executed trades for Ballow, that carried out the scheme, at a time when they perceived or recklessly disregarded red flags that Ballow was engaging in a manipulation.  The manipulative trades included marking the close, massive purchases of EVTC stock on margin by off-shore companies that dried up the float of EVTC, and simultaneous or near-simultaneous buying and selling of the stocks. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants, as well as equitable relief in the form of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

The Commission's complaint alleges that on September 8 and 9, 2010, one or more unknown traders made approximately $1.726,810 in illicit purchases through an omnibus account at the broker-dealer Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. in Vienna, Austria. On the same day, Global announced an agreement pursuant to which it would pay $8.00 in cash per share, a 55 percent premium over Global's closing share price on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition announcement. There was no significant publicly-available news about Global during the two trading days preceding the stock purchases. The complaint further alleges the unknown buyers realized total profits of about $2,500,000 from the illegal purchases, realizing a total profit of nearly $3,800,400. In a parallel action the U. S. Attorney's Office for Eastern and Central America announced criminal charges against Global and its affiliates.

(&#8220;Global&#8221;) had entered into an agreement pursuant to which Technip would offer to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Global for $8.00 per share, a 55% premium over the closing price of Global common stock on the trading day preceding the public announcement. The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that the Unknown Purchasers engaged in insider trading, thereby violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, the disgorgement of all illegal profits, and the imposition of civil money penalties.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that on September 8 and 9, 2011, the Unknown Purchasers bought a total of 685,840 shares of Global common stock through an omnibus account in the name of Raiffeisen Bank International AG Vienna, Austria, at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., at share prices ranging from $5.14 to $5.39.  These purchases accounted for 8.6% and 11.9%, respectively, of the total volume of Global trading on each of those days.  The closing price for Global common stock on September 9 was $5.15 per share.  On the next trading day, September 12, before the U.S. markets opened, the public announcement of the Global buy-out was made. Following the public announcement, Global shares opened at $7.77.  The Unknown Purchasers sold all 685,840 shares of Global on September 12 at prices ranging from $7.77 to $7.80 per share, realizing a profit of approximately $1,726,809.

CEO and Former CFO of UTSI With Improper Reporting of Financial Results   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in San Francisco charging former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of United Technologies Technologies Corporation (UTStarCom) and former CEO Michael Sophie with violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  According to the Commission's complaint, between 2000 and 2006, the company improperly recognized revenue on transactions subject to undisclosed side agreements, failed to properly account for related party transactions, improperly accounted for compensation expenses related to employee stock option grants, falsely certified the accuracy and completeness of its quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Rule 13a-14, which requires reporting by a public company to be accurate and complete. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, both defendants consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering them to pay disgorgement and penalties of $25,000, $10,500 and $5,200, respectively. In a separate administrative proceeding, Lu was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations and to cooperate fully with SEC staff in order to resolve the matter. According, in its complaint filed today, filed in U.C., Lu, a co-founder and chief executive officer and a former chief financial officer, was on notice since at least 2003 of significant internal controls weaknesses in China, including the use of side letters and contract amendments introducing revenue contingencies precluded from revenue recognition.

Sophie in connection with the company's false financial reports and recurring internal control deficiencies.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Lu and Sophie agreed to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $75,000, respectively.  According to the complaint, UTStarcom publicly reported over $400 million in sales between 2000 and 2005 that were subject to undisclosed side agreements or contract modifications rendering revenue recognition improper under applicable accounting principles.  The Commission further alleges that UTStarcom failed to disclose and properly account for transactions between the company and an entity controlled by an executive of UTStarcom's China subsidiary, and that the company failed to properly record compensation expenses for employee stock options.

Clifford, d/b/a Clifford Financial Associates, Civil Action No.: 08-CV-11023-RGS (D. Mass.)  SEC CHARGES MASSACHUSETTS-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH FRAUD  The Securities &amp; Exchange commission today charged a Massachusetts-based investment adviser with defrauding investors by falsely claiming that he was affiliated with a broker-dealer, LPL Financial Corp. and Investment Advisers.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, from at least July, 2004 through the present, Stephen ""Sydney"" Clifford of Lynnfield, Massachusetts raised approximately $2.9 million from investors in Massachusetts and Florida by promising guaranteed returns of 7% per year on investments, guaranteed annual disbursements and then failed to make timely payments in excess of the promised amounts to investors, and falsely assured investors that the safety of their investments was paramount. The SEC alleges that Clifford and his investment advisory firm, Clifford Financial Associates (CFA), were associated with two different registered investment advisers, a registered broker broker dealer and a certified investment advisor, which were also registered with the Commission. In both instances, the individuals who entrusted Clifford with managing their funds for their own benefit were given the false impression that they were earning money from Clifford's investments. Cliffs allegedly used the money to support his lavish lifestyle and to pay returns to other investors. As described in a separate complaint, in one instance, he used $1.5 million of investor funds to repay his ex-wife, who had recently died and was living in her own apartment, for his personal benefit. Another investor allegedly gave the investor money for a monthly mortgage payment. When one investor tried to get the funds back, however, according to a second investor, Clayord became evasive. Finally, on June 4, 2007, one of Clifford &#8211;s clients found his daughter-in-law's account and called him to tell him that she had ""lost her daughter,"" and he would not be able to return her investment to her father.

Stephen F. Clifford , (United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civ. Action No. 09-08-CA-11023(RGS))  SEC Obtains Temporary Restraining Order and Asset Freeze Against Massachusetts-Based Investment Adviser Stephen F. Clifford  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed an emergency enforcement action today in federal district court in Massachusetts and obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze and other relief against Stephen F. Clifford, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser, in connection with a scheme to defraud investors in an advisory business he called Clifford Financial Associates (""CFA""). The Commission's complaint alleges that Clifford, of Plymouth, Massachusetts, raised at least $2.9 million from at least eight investors in Massachusetts and Florida and that on June 4, 2008, while under arrest on unrelated charges, he made statements to the police indicating that he defrauded his investors of $3 million.  The Commission's complaint alleges that since at least July, 2004, Clifford has induced investors, many of them elderly, to entrust him with funds by (1) misrepresenting that he and CFA were registered investment advisors; (2) misrepresenting that he and CFA were affiliated with a particular registered investment adviser/broker-dealer when he was not; (3) guaranteeing a minimum return on investments; (4) promising yearly disbursements and then failing to make such payments in at least one year; and (5) falsely assuring investors of the safety of their investments.  The Commission's Complaint further alleges that, after gaining control over the investors' funds, Clifford produced sporadic statements or reports purporting to show that the investors were earning money, but that he became evasive when investors asked for the return of their funds and ultimately stopped responding to their requests and communications.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Clifford violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Honorable Richard G. Stearns issued a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws, an order freezing Clifford's assets, an order prohibiting the acceptance of additional investor funds, an accounting of assets and an order prohibiting the alteration or destruction of relevant documents, as well as other relief.  The Commission also seeks the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment interest and the imposition of civil monetary penalties against Clifford.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of Massachusetts Secretary of State William Francis Galvin's Securities Division, which simultaneously brought an administrative cease-and-desist action against Clifford, and the Bourne, Massachusetts Police Department.

SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH FRAUDULENT MISAPPROPRIATION SCHEME  The Securities &amprology and Securities Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against a Northern California investment adviser, its principals, and their two brothers, Kurt Sr., age 43, of Belvedere, California and, since 1999, has served as member, President, Chief Investment Officer, Vice-President and Portfolio Manager, respectively. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 2008 through 2009, the defendants misappropriated client assets and provided phony documents to the Commission to conceal their wrongdoing. Among other things:   In numerous disclosure documents and agreements, defendants assured clients and others that they would only use soft dollars to pay for certain services that benefitted HCM's clients (such as investment research) and would not use the money to make such payments.&nbsp;  Contrary to their disclosures, they secretly used the funds they received for their own purposes, including to cover the salary of their brother, who was recently terminated from the investment advisory industry.  According to SEC Complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, in January 2010, when Commission examiners requested records related to H.CM&#8217;s soft dollar uses, a complaint filed by the SEC alleged that the Defendants created phony research reports and made false and misleading statements in order to convince the brokerage firms that their funds were being used for legitimate research purposes. In addition to these false statements and false representations, one of the complaint's main sources of revenue came from a third party consultant, which was also paid in so-called ""soft dollar"" rebates that were falsely certified by a registered broker-dealer.

Kurt S. Hovan, Lisa B. Hovan, Edward J. Hovan, Jr., and Hovan Capital Management, LLC, Civil Action No. CV11-4795  SEC CHARGES BAY AREA INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR DEFRAUDING CLIENTS AND FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS DURING SEC EXAM  Washington, D.C., Sept. 28, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a San Francisco-area investment adviser with fraud for lying to clients about how brokerage commission rebates were being used and producing phony documents to cover up the fraud during an SEC examination.  The SEC alleges that Kurt Hovan misappropriated more than $178,000 in âsoft dollarsâ that he falsely claimed to be using to pay for legitimate investment research on his clientsâ behalf.  In reality, Hovan was secretly funneling the money for such undisclosed uses as office rent, computer hardware, and his brotherâs salary.  When SEC examination staff asked Hovan to provide documentation to back up his claims, he created phony research reports.  The SEC also charged his wife Lisa Hovan and his brother Edward Hovan for their roles in the fraudulent scheme at Hovan Capital Management (HCM).  Soft dollars are credits or rebates from brokerage firms on commissions paid by clients for trades executed in the client accounts of an investment adviser.  If appropriately disclosed, an investment adviser may retain the soft dollar credits to pay for a limited category of brokerage and research services that benefit clients.  According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco, Kurt and Lisa Hovan falsely disclosed to clients that HCM would use soft dollars only for certain research services.  Instead, they used $166,667 in soft dollars to pay Edward Hovanâs salary over a 10-month period in 2008 and 2009.  To cover up these payments, the three Hovans created a shell company â âBolton Researchâ â secretly controlled by Edward Hovan.  Through this company, the Hovans invoiced HCMâs brokerage firms for research services that had never been rendered.  Once Edward Hovan received the payments, he kicked back approximately 40 percent ($65,000) to Kurt and Lisa Hovan to pay the office rent.  The SEC further alleges that Kurt and Lisa Hovan instructed a research provider paid with soft dollars to pad its invoices by $12,000 and kick back this amount to help HCM pay for a new computer server.  During a January 2010 examination of HCM, the SEC staff asked HCM to provide copies of the research reports prepared by Bolton Research in exchange for the soft dollar payments.  In response, Kurt Hovan quickly drafted numerous research reports and doctored materials to make them appear as if they had been prepared by Bolton.  Hovan provided these phony documents to SEC examiners.  The SECâs complaint charges Kurt Hovan with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ), Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (âInvestment Company Actâ), and aiding and abetting violations of Section 204(a) of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2(a)(7).  The SECâs complaint charges Lisa Hovan with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Section 207 of the Advisers Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.  The SECâs complaint charges Edward Hovan with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.  The SECâs complaint charges HCM with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Sections 204(a), 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Advisers Act, and Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.  The SECâs case was investigated by Karen Kreuzkamp and Robert S. Leach of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The examination of HCM was conducted by Karah To, Tracey A. Bonner, and Ada C. Chee of the San Francisco Regional Officeâs investment adviser/investment company examination program.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging Mark Rristow and two of his relatives with participating in a fraudulent scheme to defraud the banks and their depositors by secretly using relatives as nominees to acquire stock in 23 public offerings of banks that were converting from mutual to stock ownership.  According to the Commission's complaint, from October 1994 through January 2007, the defendants operated a scheme that generated a total of over $3.11 million in fraudulent profits from secondary market sales of the illegally obtained stock. The complaint alleges that the nominees participated in this scheme by opening bank accounts in their own names and using their relatives to pay for their personal expenses, including mortgage payments, credit card bills, car payments and home furnishings, as well as the purchase of shares in accounts held by relatives and friends. As alleged, one nominee even attempted to conceal her relationship with her cousin, who was also a nominee. In a parallel action, on July 20, 2008, Judge Paul Gizzi issued a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief, freezing assets and appointing a receiver to marshal the assets of both defendants and the relief defendants in connection with the alleged scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations in today's Complaint, all three defendants consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties and an officer-and-director bar for each defendant and to be permanently barred from serving as an unregistered broker-dealer or investment adviser in an offering of a penny stock or an investment company. Additionally, both the nominee and defendant agreed to disgorge $164,761, which represents the total amount of illicit profits they received from the scheme, plus interest thereon, with a $25,000 civil penalty, for a period of five years, in order to offset the losses received by the defendant nominee's family members. Finally, a final judgment permanently enjoins all defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20292 / September 24, 2007  SEC v. Mark Ristow et al., Civil Action No. 07-4547 (D.N.J.)  SEC Charges Three Individuals in Multi-Million Dollar Scheme To Defraud Savings Banks And Their Depositors    On September 24, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging three individuals with securities fraud for participating in a decade-long scheme to defraud savings banks and their depositors in connection with the banks' conversion from mutual to stock ownership. All three defendants agreed to settle the Commission's charges.  When banks convert to stock ownership, depositors receive priority rights to purchase shares at a low price. Banking regulations and offering terms limit the number of shares a depositor may purchase and prohibit transfer of the depositor's purchase rights. The SEC's complaint alleges that, from 1994 to 2007, Mark Ristow orchestrated a scheme to circumvent the limitations on stock purchases in 23 bank conversions. Ristow made over $3 million in profits by selling the bank stock he had illegally obtained. The other defendants are Andrew Crabb, Ristow's cousin, and Susan Gitlin, Ristow's sister-in-law. In return for a share of the profits, they assisted Ristow by acting as his nominees, thus enabling Ristow to purchase even more shares. Because the offerings were oversubscribed, the defendants' fraud harmed legitimate depositors who received fewer shares than they otherwise would have.  More specifically, the defendants named in the Commission's complaint are:  Mark Ristow, age 62, a resident of Indianapolis, Indiana. He is a retired real estate investor and property manager. He received a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1971.  Andrew Crabb, age 41, and a resident of Mechanicstown, Ohio. He is employed as an engineer for an environmental consulting firm. Crabb is Ristow's cousin and lived in New Jersey during the relevant period.  Susan Gitlin, age 49, and a resident of Norfolk, Virginia. She is a medical research scientist and an assistant medical school professor. Gitlin's sister is married to Ristow.  The Commission's complaint alleges as follows:  The defendants deliberately evaded federal and state banking regulations designed to ensure that when a bank converts to stock ownership, each of the bank's depositors has a fair chance to purchase stock before other interested investors do so. These and other applicable regulations and the offering terms contained in the converting banks' prospectuses imposed maximum purchase limits and prohibited the transfer of depositors' purchase rights. To ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority purchase rights, federal and state banking regulations prohibit depositors from transferring ownership of their purchase rights or from entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering.  Ristow funded the opening of accounts in his own name and the names of Crabb and Gitlin at mutual savings banks throughout the country in the hope that they would convert to stock ownership. When any of the banks undertook a conversion, Ristow secretly funded his nominees' stock purchases, controlled the sale of his nominees' shares and retained most of the trading profits. Ristow also had the nominees submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified to the banks that they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer the shares or the proceeds of their sale. Ristow caused his nominees to make these material misrepresentations in 23 public stock offerings by banks. The 23 offerings were oversubscribed, and the defendants' misconduct therefore limited the amount of stock available to legitimate depositors, some of whom received less stock than they requested or were completely shut out. Ristow and his nominees made over $3 million from the scheme at the expense of other depositors.  Crabb and Gitlin knowingly played a key role in carrying out the scheme, and profited from their own misconduct. Crabb and Gitlin worked with Ristow to set up as many accounts as possible on Ristow's behalf. To satisfy in-state residency requirements, Crabb and Gitlin opened multiple accounts in their names for Ristow at banks in their respective home states, New Jersey and Virginia. Crabb spent over a decade traveling around New Jersey opening accounts for Ristow and using his own home address for those accounts to avoid arousing suspicion. To help Ristow open an account at a New Jersey-based credit union, Crabb had his New Jersey consulting firm join the credit union and then sent the credit union a phony letter on his firm's letterhead offering Ristow a position with the firm.  All three defendants are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In the complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties. Each of the defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission's complaint, has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, all three of the defendants have agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting, without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, to the entry of permanent antifraud injunctions. In addition, Crabb will disgorge $98,628 in profits he made from the scheme, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. Gitlin will disgorge $164,761 in profits, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $75,000. Because Ristow has already agreed to forfeit an amount equivalent to his ill-gotten gains in conjunction with his guilty plea in the parallel criminal case, the consent judgment in the SEC case does not require disgorgement of those same ill-gotten gains. The Commission's claim for a civil penalty against Ristow will remain pending.  In a parallel criminal proceeding, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey has announced that it filed criminal charges against Ristow for the same conduct. Earlier today, Ristow agreed to pay a total of $2.85 million in forfeiture, representing his own illegal profits from the scheme.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter.

340,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Bryan Cohen and George Nikas with engaging in an insider trading scheme that netted them at least $2.6 million in illicit profits.  According to the SEC's complaint, between April 2015 and November 2017, Cohen, who was employed at a large international investment bank, carried out the scheme by misappropriating from his employer material nonpublic information concerning impending corporate transactions involving companies advised by Investment Bank A. The SEC alleges that Cohen tipped two individuals who traded in advance of news that these companies had been targeted for acquisition in contemplated or agreed upon corporate deals (the ""Deals"").  The complaint alleges, however, that neither individual traded on the basis of the confidential information provided to him by Cohen. Instead, the two men allegedly traded the securities of two companies that were at or near the brink of acquisition, knowing that they would be profiting from the illegal trading. In a parallel action, on November 11, 2017 the Honorable Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order freezing Cohen's assets and ordering him to pay a total of $1,854,340 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties, which will be determined by the court upon a motion motion filed in federal district court in Manhattan. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both defendants consented to permanent injunctions and to a conduct-based injunction that prohibits them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, as well as the anti-hierarchical reporting provisions under Section 14(e) and (f) 13(d) Section 15(f)(2) (a)(1) for a period of five years, to be followed by a five-year period-long officer-and-director bar and a three year officer and director bar for each defendant's participation in a scheme involving the trading of securities in connection with contemplated and agreed-upon deals.

The SEC also obtained an order freezing the trader's assets.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Bryan Cohen, learned nonpublic information about the potential acquisitions through his role as an investment banker based in London and New York.  Cohen allegedly shared this information with at least one foreign individual who traded on the information and further tipped it to George Nikas who resides in New York, New York and Athens, Greece.  According to the SEC's complaint, Nikas used the information to net over $2.6 million in illicit profits resulting from trades in stock, American Depositary Shares, and Contracts for Difference, which were traded or hedged on U.S. exchanges.  The case originated from the SEC Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns, such as improbably successful trading across different securities over time.Â  Enhanced detection capabilities enabled SEC Enforcement staff to spot the unusual trading activities alleged in the SEC's complaint.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cohen and Nikas.  The SEC's complaint charges Cohen and Nikas with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

The seven issuers were Gran Tierra Energy, Inc., Foothills Resources Inc. and MMC Energy Inc.; Alternative Energy Sources Inc.'s (âAdvisers&#8212;), Ethanex Energy Ltd., GoFish Corp., and Kreido Biofuels, a Delaware limited liability company.  According to its complaint, in each of these transactions, the Defendants agreed (as all the subscribers did) that the shares that they received would be issued with restrictive legends until such time as the issuer filed registration statements with the Commission and the SEC declared them effective. As a result of their fraudulent conduct, these shares were able to sell into the public market at a discount to market price, generating illicit profits of at least $17.8 million. In addition, as counsel for each issuer, Michael F. Hahn, an attorney at the law firm of McGuireWoods LLP, assisted the defendants in drafting the registration statement, which, without admitting or denying the allegations, permanently enjoined the entities from violating the anti-fraud, registration, books-and-records and internal controls provisions contained in Sections 5(a), (c) and (d) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Zehil, et al., Civil Action No. 07CV1439 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC Charges Corporate Attorney With Securities Fraud and Obtains Asset Freeze    The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an injunctive action in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that from approximately January 2006 to February 2007, Louis W. Zehil (""Zehil""), a corporate attorney, and two entities he controlled, Strong Branch Ventures IV LP (""Strong"") and Chestnut Capital Partners II, LLC (""Chestnut""), engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain and sell to the investing public millions of shares of securities in violation of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. With the consent of the parties, Judge Preska entered an order granting a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, the appointment of a receiver and other relief.  Zehil, age 41, was until recently a partner with the law firm of McGuireWoods LLP. Zehil is a resident of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida and worked at the firm's offices in New York, New York, and Jacksonville, Florida.  The Complaint alleges that between January 2006 and February 2007, Zehil represented seven public companies in issuing their stock in PIPE transactions (private investments in public equity). The seven public companies were Gran Tierra Energy, Inc., Foothills Resources, Inc., MMC Energy, Inc., Alternative Energy Sources, Inc., Ethanex Energy, Inc., GoFish Corp., and Kreido BioFuels, Inc. At all relevant times, their common stock was registered with the Commission and quoted on the OTC-BB. In these PIPE transactions (as in PIPEs generally), the investors purchased restricted stock at a discount to market price.  The Complaint also alleges that Zehil personally invested in the issuers' PIPE transactions through Strong and Chestnut. In the subscription agreements for each PIPE transaction, the Defendants agreed (as all the PIPE subscribers did) that the shares they received would be issued with restrictive legends until such time as the issuers filed registration statements with the Commission and the Commission declared them effective. As counsel for the issuers, Zehil then sent letters to the issuers' transfer agents directing the issuance of shares to the PIPE subscribers. Zehil's letters instructed that all the shares should bear restrictive legends except the shares issued to his entities, Strong and Chestnut. Zehil's letters stated, falsely, that the shares issued to Strong and Chestnut satisfied legal criteria to be issued without restrictive legend. As a result of their fraudulent conduct, the Defendants were able to receive shares without restrictive legends, which they quickly sold into the public market, and generated illicit profits of at least $17 million &nbsp; The complaint charges Zehil, Strong and Chestnut with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court granted, among other relief, a preliminary injunction order which included an asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver over Strong and Chestnut. In its enforcement action, the Commission is seeking additional relief, including orders permanently enjoining Zehil, Strong and Chestnut from committing future violations of the foregoing federal securities laws, and a final judgment ordering Zehil, Strong and Chestnut to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and assessing civil penalties.

Md.)  SEC Charges Baltimore-Based Sports Apparel Retailer With Securities Fraud  On September 29, 2006, the Securities &amp; Exchange Act (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland charging Baltimore resident Ronald Bowen with securities fraud.  The Commission alleges that Bowen sold more than 100,000 shares of restricted stock of Under Armour, Inc. (Under Armour), a Baltimore based sports apparel company, to four investors in late 2005 and early 2006. According to the complaint, Bowen falsely told the investors that he had access to a certain number of units of the stock pursuant to an initial public offering (IPO) by the company in November 2005. The complaint further alleges Bowen told one of his friends that there was another investor who had also bought IPO stock from Bowen but who wanted to sell his 3847 shares. In reality, as alleged, he never had any stock as part of its IPO and instead took the investor's money. Finally, when the restriction on the offering was to be lifted and investors demanded their stock certificates, his scheme to defraud was unmasked. He confessed, without admitting or denying the allegations, and paid back the $2,500 of investor money he took from the four retail investors, totaling over $233,800. Without admitting the SEC's findings, which were filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland on September 28, 2008, Judge James A. Friestad, a federal district court judge in Maryland, issued a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Bowen and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties totaling $1.5 million. Additionally, in a separate administrative proceeding filed on November 14, 2011, U. S. District Judge John Rymas issued an order temporarily restraining Bowen from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a) and (d) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)(5) thereunder, ordering Bowen to disgorge all profits realized from his fraudulent scheme, pay a $3,200 civil penalty and pay an officer and director bar","SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  20399 / December 14, 2007  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V.

BOWEN WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS REGARDING POTENTIAL INVESTMENT IN UNDER ARMOUR IPO  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Ronald K. Bowen alleging that he engaged in securities fraud by lying to investors about the possibility of investing in the November 2005 initial public offering by Under Armour, Inc.  Bowen raised more than $230,000 from four investors through his fraudulent scheme.  The Commission&#8217;s complaint, filed in the District of Maryland, alleges that Bowen defrauded the investors by purporting to offer to sell them more than 100,000 shares of stock of Under Armour, Inc., a Baltimore based sports apparel company, in late 2005 and early 2006.  Bowen falsely claimed that he had access to Under Armour stock pursuant to an initial public offering by Under Armour in November 2005.  In order to induce the investors to participate, Bowen drafted and disseminated phony disclosure documents that appeared to demonstrate that Bowen&#8217;s IPO stock purchase offer was legitimate.  In fact, Bowen never had access to Under Armour IPO stock.  In November 2006, when the investors demanded stock certificates for the stock they thought they had purchased, Bowen told them that he never had any Under Armour IPO stock to sell.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that, as a result of his misconduct, Bowen violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  As part of this action, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting Bowen from committing future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties.   The United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Maryland has filed related criminal charges against Bowen.

SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH FRAUD  On May 3, United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an emergency order freezing the assets of a California-based investment adviser accused of fraudulently raising at least $3.3 million from investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that Robert ""Butler"" Butler falsely promised investors monthly returns of 2 to 10 percent through investments in his fund, the Butler Private Investment Fund, BTl Fund and Hawk Performance Thrust Vector Application. In reality, Butler never earned such exorbitant returns and, according to the SEC, he lost money through his securities trading. The court also froze Butler's assets and ordered accountings from the account of the fund. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, which was entered by the Honorable Janet R. Nolank, on May 2 and 3 of 2011, a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze were placed against Butler and other defendants in connection with the alleged fraud and the issuance of emergency court orders freezing their assets, appointing an independent monitor, and appointing a receiver over all assets under the control of Butler. A hearing on the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction has not yet been scheduled for June 30, but the Court will determine the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties to be imposed upon Butler at a later date.The SEC previously charged Butler with fraud in a similar scheme in 2009. He was charged with securities fraud for failing to disclose to investors that he had filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 in 1998, when he was a resident of Bermuda Dunes, Calif. and had been operating a securities business out of his home since January 2009, using three different business names: Butler private investment funds, et al. (the ""Fund""), and his personal brokerage account. As a result of this conduct, his funds have been defrauded of approximately $1.9 million and $47,000, respectively, of investor funds. On April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010, they were allegedly taken out from their brokerage accounts and transferred to his own personal bank","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21959 /May 5, 2011  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Butler, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 11-03792 MMM (FFMx) (filed May 3, 2011)  SEC HALTS FRAUDULENT DAY TRADING SCHEME TARGETING SENIOR CITIZENS  The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency asset freeze and court order to halt an ongoing securities fraud being orchestrated by Robert C. Butler of Bermuda Dunes, Calif.  The SEC alleges that from January 2009 to March 2011, Butler raised approximately $3.3 million from at least 17 investors who were mostly senior citizens living in or around Indio, Calif. He operated out of his home and dazzled investors with his multiple computer screens and a purported proprietary trading program that he claimed to use in his day trading business. Butler promised exorbitant returns to investors through investments in his hedge fund, but instead stole $1.6 million and lost the other half of investor funds in his securities trading.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that Butler sent falsified account statements to investors in order to conceal his fraud, and grossly inflated the hedge fund balances. According to one statement, the fund balance was $8.9 million compared to the true balance of merely $22. The SEC further alleges that Butler lied that he was a graduate of MIT and he concealed from investors his Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in 1998. Despite investor requests, Butler has failed to return their money and instead continues to solicit new funds and lull existing investors into believing that repayments are forthcoming.  The Honorable Margaret Morrow, United States District Judge, granted the SEC&#8217;s application for emergency relief and froze the defendants&#8217; assets. On May 11, 2011, the court will hold a hearing on the SEC&#8217;s motion for a preliminary injunction.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Butler with violating the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, of the federal securities laws. In addition to the emergency relief, the complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and financial penalties.

Todd Farha, Paul Behrens, and Thaddeus Bereday, Defendants, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Civil Action No.: 12-cv-00702 (M.D. Fla.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER CEO OF HEALTH CARE WITH FOREIGN SCHEME  On September 28,2012, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against the former CEO of Well Care Health Plans, Inc. and former General Counsel of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and WellCare's former chief financial officer and general counsel, for engaging in a fraudulent scheme that defrauded AHCA and Florida Healthy Kids Corporation (Healthy Kids).  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 2003 through 2007, Wellcare, through its health maintenance organizations (HMOs), received over $40 million in health care premiums from the state agencies to be used to provide medical and health benefits to qualified participants. According to the complaint, while the scheme was ongoing, Staywell and HealthEase did not follow state agency guidance governing how the company was required to spend the premiums on eligible medical expenses. Instead, they used ineligible expenses in their refund calculations, such as payments to Harmony Behavioral Health, to conceal the fraud. The complaint further alleges the defendants failed to establish and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to prevent material misstatements in the Company's books, records and financial statements. Moreover, as the Defendants continued to defraud the State of Fla. by improperly retaining unspent behavioral health insurance premiums and recording this amount as revenue, their trading plans were designed to circumvent the agency's statutory and contractual interpretations. As a result of their conduct, wellCare reported negative net income and diluted earnings per share in quarterly and annual earnings releases for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. In addition to aiding and abetting the violations of these provisions of federal securities laws and state securities law, each defendant has agreed to pay a penalty of $100,000, which is equal to his or her disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, with the payment of civil monetary penalties and an officer-and-director bar against him.","Litigation Release No. 22221 / January 10, 2012  Accounting and Auditing Release No. 3353 / January 10, 2012  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

(&#8220;WellCare&#8221;), a managed care services company that administers federal government-sponsored health care programs.  According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, from 2003 to 2007, Todd Farha, former Chief Executive Officer, Paul Behrens, former Chief Financial Officer, and Thaddeus Bereday, former General Counsel, (collectively, &#8220;the Defendants&#8221;), devised and carried out a fraudulent scheme that deceived the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (&#8220;AHCA&#8221;) and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation (&#8220;Healthy Kids&#8221;) by improperly retaining over $40 million in health care premiums the company was statutorily and contractually obligated to spend on certain health care services or reimburse to the state agencies.  As a result of the scheme, WellCare recorded the retained amount as revenue, which materially inflated its net income and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) in its public financial statements.    As alleged in the complaint, WellCare received premiums from AHCA and Healthy Kids that WellCare was required, by contract and by statute, to spend on certain eligible health care services for low-income plan participants.  If WellCare spent less than a certain percentage of the premiums on eligible health care services, it was required to refund some or all of the difference to the State of Florida.  According to the complaint, the Defendants devised a scheme to evade the state&#8217;s regulatory framework and fraudulently retain the premiums by, among other methods, funneling the premiums through an internal subsidiary and by applying administrative and other non-allowable expenses in their calculation of money spent on health care services.  In total, through their fraudulent conduct, the complaint alleges that WellCare reduced the refunds it paid to AHCA by approximately $35 million and to Healthy Kids by approximately $6 million.     The excess premiums retained by the Defendants went straight to WellCare&#8217;s bottom line.  WellCare materially misstated its net income and EPS in filings with the Commission and in quarterly and annual earnings releases from 2004-2006 and the first two quarters of 2007.  On January 26, 2009, WellCare filed its Form 10-K for 2007 and restated its financial results for those time periods.  The Restatement reduced WellCare&#8217;s reported net income and EPS by approximately 14% for fiscal year (&#8220;FY&#8221;) 2004, 9% for FY 2005, 13% for FY 2006, and 9% for the first quarter of FY 2007.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint also alleges that, after setting their fraudulent scheme in motion, the Defendants sold approximately 1.6 million WellCare shares into the public market for gross proceeds of approximately $91 million.  The Commission alleges that the Defendants sold these shares on the basis of the material, nonpublic information that they were conducting a fraudulent scheme that impacted WellCare&#8217;s financial results, caused false and misleading statements, and imperiled the Company&#8217;s business relationship with the State of Florida.  According to the complaint, the Defendants sold the shares pursuant to 10b5-1 trading plans that were created and amended in bad faith, and through three public stock offerings conducted while the scheme was ongoing.    Based on the conduct alleged in the complaint, the Commission charges that each of the Defendants violated antifraud provisions Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and also violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  All of the Defendants are also charged with aiding and abetting WellCare&#8217;s violations of reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions, namely, Sections (13)(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13.  Bereday is charged with aiding and abetting Farha&#8217;s and Behrens&#8217; violations of antifraud provisions Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) of the Exchange Act.  Finally, Farha and Behrens are charged with violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-2 and 13a-14, and Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires that the CEO or CFO of a company that restates its financial results to reimburse the company any incentive-based or equity-based compensation received and any profits realized from the sale of the company&#8217;s stock during the 12-month period following initial issuance of the misleading financial statements.    As to each Defendant, the Commission is seeking a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the provisions of the securities laws specified above, civil penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and officer and director bars.  As to Farha and Behrens, the Commission seeks reimbursement of incentive-based and equity-based compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley.    In conducting its investigation, the Commission acknowledges assistance from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Middle District of Florida, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Cal. filed Sept. 25)  SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH FRAUDULENTLY MISAPPROPRIATING $40 MILLION PONZI SCHEME   The Securities &amp;Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California against Folsom, California-based equity investment management and trading, company, and its principals, for conducting a Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 150 investors.  According to the Commission's complaint, from approximately 2004 through November 2008, the defendants obtained over $50 million from over 200 investors, purportedly to be invested in buying and selling securities. Many investors were members of a religious community. The complaint alleges that, in monthly performance reports and other communications, Defendants led investors to believe that EIMT was actively engaged in securities trading and was posting consistent, positive returns. These representations were false. In fact in September 2007, when the company ceased trading on behalf of EimT, it had withdrawn virtually all investor funds from its brokerage accounts and misappropriated the funds for their own personal use. As a result of the fraud, investors faced millions of dollars in losses and were forced to pay substantial sums of money to settle the SEC's charges.

Cal. filed March 11, 2009)  SEC Charges Two Northern California Residents in $40 Million Ponzi Scheme     The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Northern California residents Anthony Vassallo and Kenneth Kenitzer for orchestrating a multi-million dollar investment fraud.  Vassallo agreed to a court order freezing his assets.  The SEC is seeking an emergency court order to also freeze the assets of Vassallo's company, Equity Investment Management and Trading, Inc. (EIMT).  According to the SEC's complaint, Vassallo and Kenitzer raised more than $40 million from about 150 investors from approximately May 2004 to November 2008.  Vassallo told investors, many of whom he met through his church, that he had a proprietary computer software program that allowed him to buy and sell stock options and generate returns of 3.5 percent per month with little risk of loss.  The SEC alleges that Vassallo and Kenitzer instead used investors' money for unauthorized purposes, including a variety of other schemes never disclosed to investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, alleges that Vassallo told investors that their money was being invested in securities pursuant to a proprietary trading strategy that promised high returns with minimal risk.  From September 2007 through approximately November 2008, Kenitzer, who participated in EIMT's day-to-day operations, posted false trading results on the company's Web site and distributed phony investment reports to investors that led them to believe EIMT was achieving consistent, positive returns.  According to the SEC's complaint, EIMT actually had not conducted any stock trades since at least September 2007, when its brokerage firm terminated Vassallo's trading privileges.  The SEC alleges that Vassallo and Kenitzer kept the scheme going by using money raised from new investors to pay earlier investors, a classic hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.  The SEC's complaint charges Vassallo, Kenitzer and EIMT with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, the SEC's complaint charges Vassallo with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  In addition to an emergency order freezing EIMT's assets, the SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of defendants' ill-gotten gains, and financial penalties.

346,"On August 30, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former senior executive at a Redwood City, Calif.-based cloud security company with insider trading.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Amer Deeba learned from his brothers that Qualys, Inc. had missed its sales forecast for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2015, and that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward, resulting in losses of $456,636 and $124,534, respectively. According to the complaint, after the company publicly announced its disappointing financial results on May 4, 2015 and subsequently announced the disappointing revenue and sales figures, he tipped his two brothers, who then sold their shares. The next day, as a result of his tip, Qualy's stock price fell 25%.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal district court in San Francisco, a convicted felon has agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a penalty equal to his trading profits and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years. He has also consented to a permanent officer-and-director bar and an order barring him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. In a parallel action, on August 31, 2020, Judge Reed O'Connor entered a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the brothers and ordered them to return their stock to an escrowed, unregistered brokerage account. On the same day the court entered the order, Deba's brothers' brokerage accounts were opened and sold by one of them. After the market closed on April 8, 2017, Q1 2015 reported a revenue miss of 28%, representing 28% year-over year growth. By selling all of its stock in advance of that day's announcement, both brothers avoided losses totaling $581,170, which they would have avoided had they traded on the basis of material, nonpublic information. As a consequence, they avoided trading in their own securities and avoided substantial losses in excess of their gains.

The SEC alleges that on April 7, 2015, Deeba learned that Qualys had missed its internal Q1 2015 sales forecast, which served as a basis for the revenue guidance the company provided to the market. According to the SEC, the next day, Deeba informed his two brothers about the miss and contacted his brothers' brokerage firm to coordinate the sale of all of his brothers' Qualys stock. When Qualys publicly announced its financial results, it reported that it had missed its previously-announced first-quarter revenue guidance and that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward.  On the same day, Deeba sent a message to one of his brothers saying, ""We announced the bad news today."" The next day, Qualys's stock price dropped 25%. Although Deeba made no profits from his conduct, Deeba's brothers collectively avoided losses of $581,170 by selling their Qualys stock.  After seventeen years at Qualys, Deeba resigned his position as a senior leader and officer of Qualys on August 2, 2018. Under the terms of his settlement, which is subject to court approval, he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-reporting company for two years and he will pay a $581,170 penalty.  To settle the SEC's charges, without admitting or denying the allegations, Deeba has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission's complaint alleges that from June through August of 2005, Global's management employed a complex scheme to provide three foreign entities with purportedly unrestricted Global shares, after which they arranged for Global to issue numerous false and misleading press releases, including a claim that a major oil and gas services firm was a client. The complaint further alleges the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme in which Global acquired a Florida shell corporation and used an investor relations firm to disseminate all of the false information. According to the complaint, in connection with the scheme Global and its two officers and directors allegedly drafted and signed a false legal opinion letter that was disseminated by the company's public statements, which included a baseless attorney opinion that Bua signed, as well as a letter from a Panamanian attorney representing the shell's owner, stating that Global had $67 million in booked sales and that an oil-and-gas services client had a controlling interest in Old Mission Assessment Corporation. In addition, according to a complaint filed in federal court for Florida on May 21, 2005 and unsealed on June 25, it was alleged that the former CEO of Global was the sole officer and director of a private company that had been acquired through a reverse merger and later sold for proceeds of approximately $2.1 million.

Mrakuzic, Dante M. Panella, Anthony M. Cimini Sr., and Philip Prichard with securities fraud for their participation in a fraudulent scheme to evade registration requirements and engaging in a ""pump and dump"" stock manipulation scheme.  The Commission also settled fraud charges against California-based securities attorney, Carmine J. Bua, who authored a fraudulent legal opinion, which authorized the issuance of purportedly unrestricted Global shares.  Further, the Commission charged defendants Prichard and Pietro Cimino with conducting a fraudulent private offering of Global stock.  The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that from June through August 2005, defendants engaged in a complex scheme to evade the registration requirements by obtaining a fraudulently backdated convertible promissory note, using a forged assignment to assign the note to three foreign entities and then converting the note into unrestricted Global shares.  The complaint alleges that defendant Bua drafted the assignment and legal opinion letter authorizing the issuance of unrestricted shares, despite possessing information which undermined the validity of the note and its subsequent assignment.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants then engaged in a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme by arranging for Global to issue numerous press releases that contained false and misleading information relating to Global's purported clients, pending contracts and revenue projections.  According to the complaint, at least one entity defendant Mrakuzic controlled sold illegally issued Global shares into an artificially inflated market generating profits of approximately $1.2 million.  In addition, defendant Panella sold illegally issued Global shares for profits of nearly $1.1 million.  The complaint also alleges that during July 2005, defendants Global, Prichard, and Cimino conducted a private offering of Global stock and provided investors with offering materials containing many of the same false and misleading statements contained in the press releases.  According to the complaint, Global raised approximately $2.1 million through the offering, the majority of which Prichard and Cimino misappropriated for personal use.  The Commission's complaint charges:  Global with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5 thereunder; Prichard and Cimino with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Mrakuzic and Panella with violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Cimini and Bua with violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer and director bars against Prichard, Cimino and Cimini.  Upon the filing of the Commission's complaint, and without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bua consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to a penny stock bar.

SEC CHARGES FORMER UNITED STATES ARMY EMPLOYEE WITH MISAPPROPRIATING $253,252 IN INVESTOR FUNDS  The Securities &amp; Ex-United States Attorney for the Central District of Illinois today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action against a former United States Army Sergeant who misappropriated at least $250,000 in investor funds. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Springfield, Illinois, alleges that, beginning in the fall of 1996, former Sergeant David Lawson, Jr., a retired U. S. Army sergeant, and his wife, Teresa L. Kriner, invested their funds in two different investment products: (i) the Eagle Star Elite International Bond (""EIB"") and (ii) two other products, (iii) an Individual Retirement Account (""IRA"") at Oppenheimer Funds, now known as Zurich International Life Limited (""Exchange Act""). In each instance, after persuading the victims to give him funds for investment purposes, the defendants allegedly invested some of the funds as instructed, but misused the rest, often supplying phony account statements for several years thereafter to conceal his fraud. According to the Commission, in each of these instances, while working abroad in Germany and living in Europe, Smith, who was an officer of an Air Force defense contractor, had fled Germany to support his lifestyle and to operate his L&S insurance business. Smith was also associated with Nalico Equity Corporation, which is a registered broker-dealer with offices in Texas and Europe. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Commission action, on October 30, 2001, Judge Mascianica, of Chicago, issued a temporary restraining order freezing the defendant's assets and prohibiting him from further violations of Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and 17 (a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration and antifraud provisions of Section 20(d) (1).

FORMER STOCKBROKER SETTLES FRAUD CASE WITH SEC, AGREES TO BE BARRED FROM THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY, AND IS SENTENCED FOLLOWING HIS GUILTY PLEA FOR MAIL FRAUD IN PARALLEL FEDERAL CRIMINAL CASE  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it reached a settlement of its pending fraud charges against Bill L. Stapleton, a former stockbroker and retired U.S. Army Sergeant.  The Commission's complaint, originally filed on October 1, 2004, alleged that, while he was working as a stockbroker in Germany, Stapleton fraudulently misappropriated at least $253,252 from three U.S.-citizen investor victims working in the U.S. Department of Defense community there, and sent the funds to an account he controlled in Springfield, Illinois.   On October 21, 2005, the Hon. Jeanne E. Scott, United States District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, entered a Judgment of Permanent Injuction and Other Relief against Stapleton that (i) permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) orders him to fully cooperate in asset discovery; and (iii) provides that the amount of civil penalties, disgorgement and prejudgment interest will be determined by the Court at a subsequent hearing, during which the allegations of the Complaint will be accepted as and deemed true by the Court.  Stapleton consented to the entry of the Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint. Also today, based upon the entry of the injunction, the Commission instituted and simultaneously settled an administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act.  Stapleton consented, without admitting or denying the Commission's factual findings, to an order barring him from association with any broker or dealer.   At a hearing held in a related criminal proceeding on October 14, 2005, also before Judge Scott, Stapleton was sentenced to a term of 28 months in prison based on his conviction for mail fraud arising from the same underlying conduct alleged in the Commission's complaint.  (Stapleton had entered a guilty plea to the mail fraud charge on June 9, 2005.)  Judge Scott also ordered Stapleton to pay criminal restitution totaling $262,101 to the three victims of the fraud.     The Commission's complaint alleged that Stapleton's victims included an active-duty U.S. Army Sergeant, a U.S. Defense Department civilian schoolteacher and a civilian employee of a U.S. defense contractor, all of whom resided in Germany.  The complaint alleged that Stapleton was associated with Nalico Equity Corporation, which is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer having offices in Texas and in Europe, at the time of his offending conduct.  The complaint further alleged that, in each instance, after persuading the victim to give him funds for investment, Stapleton invested only a portion of the funds as instructed, misappropriating the rest.  Stapleton, the complaint further charged, supplied phony account statements to two of his three victims for several years thereafter to conceal his theft.  Finally, the complaint alleged that Stapleton fled Germany in August 2001 when questions were raised concerning funds that appeared to be missing from his automobile insurance business; and that Stapleton subsequently resided in El Paso, Texas and worked at an automobile dealership there.

According to the SEC's complaint, in August of 2013, after learning that China Energy Corp., a Nevada-based company that purportedly produces, processes, and sells raw coal products in the People's Republic of China, diverted approximately $630,000 of the funds received for the company's benefit to repay a short-term loan to a real estate investment company. The complaint also alleges that, on August 5, 2013 and August 6, 2014, Quickilver made a series of partial payments totaling $1.4 million to DTCC, which was to be disbursed to certain of its shareholders who participated in a reverse share split. As a result of this conduct, Shindleerman allegedly misappropriated $620,007 of his own money for his personal benefit, including $2,078.56 in interest payments to other entities and an $18,500 loan principal to an entity unrelated to China. In a parallel action filed with the U.S. Department of Justice on January 23, 2020, a federal court in Nevada entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against the two defendants, as well as an order temporarily enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17A(d)(1) and (c) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a), and 17Ad-12 thereunder and the internal controls and records and internal accounting controls provisions under the federal securities laws.

The SEC alleged that, in August 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1.45 million for the benefit of China Energy Corporation. The funds were destined for certain of China Energy's shareholders by way of Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The complaint alleges that Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of this money for his and Quicksilver's own use and benefit, including $500,000 to make a four-day loan to a Nevada real estate company.  According to the complaint, the borrower failed to repay the principal or interest as planned. Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman did not timely forward China Energy's funds to DTCC, despite repeated requests. Quicksilver and Shinderman also made a series of misrepresentations in response China Energy's and DTCC's requests for the funds.  Quicksilver ultimately paid DTCC approximately six weeks later, after recovering the loan principal from the real estate company. The complaint also alleges that Quicksilver untimely filed an independent accountant's report with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 31, 2013.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, from 1999 through 2002, John ""Mervn"" Nabors, former CEO and President, and its former chief financial officer, Eric ""Brocken,"" implemented multiple accounting schemes to inflate the company's reported pre-tax earnings. As a result of the accounting scheme, Aysonic reported earnings that were overstated by at least 35% to as much as 825%.  According to the complaint, these accounting gimmicks caused the Company to issue a series of false press releases touting its strong financial performance when, in fact, it had actually suffered losses totaling over $3.9 million.  The complaint further charges that the defendants financially benefited from their fraudulent activities by reaping lucrative bonuses and selling their stock while its price was artificially inflated, resulting in inflated revenues and asset values.

McCracken, Civil Action No. 8:04-CV-02288-SDM-MAP (M.D. FL)  SEC Sues Former CEO and Former CFO of a Florida Airplane Instrument Manufacturer in Financial Fraud Spanning Over Five Years  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed fraud charges on Monday against John Mervyn Nabors, the former Chief Executive Officer, and Eric J. McCracken, the former Chief Financial Officer, of Aerosonic Corporation (Aerosonic), a Clearwater, Florida airplane instrument manufacturer.   Nabors, who resides in Clearwater Beach, Florida, has settled this action with the SEC.   McCracken, formerly of Clearwater, Florida, currently resides in New York.   The case, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, has been assigned to Judge Steven D. Merryday. According to the SEC's Complaint, from January 1999 through December 2002, Nabors and McCracken implemented various accounting schemes designed to artificially inflate Aerosonic's reported pre-tax earnings.   Among their schemes, Nabors and McCracken allegedly caused Aerosonic to overstate inventory by falsifying inventory records and by failing to provide adequate reserves for Aerosonic's obsolete and slow moving inventory.   In addition, Nabors and McCracken allegedly caused Aerosonic to report inflated earnings by recording fictitious and premature revenue.   As a result of these and other accounting tricks, Aerosonic reported earnings in its periodic filings with the SEC that were overstated by at least 35% to as much as 825%.  The Complaint further alleges that during the same time period, Nabors and McCracken caused Aerosonic to issue a series of false press releases touting the Company's strong financial performance when, in fact, the Company had actually suffered losses totaling over $3.9 million.   Both Nabors and McCracken financially benefited from their fraudulent activities by reaping lucrative bonuses and, in the case of McCracken, selling his Aerosonic stock while its price was artificially inflated as a result of Aerosonic's false filings and press releases.  Both Nabors and McCracken resigned from Aerosonic in December 2002.   After Nabors and McCracken resigned, Aerosonic's new management discovered inventory and other accounting improprieties totaling in the millions.   On March 17, 2003, Aerosonic issued a press release announcing approximately $3 million in overstated revenue and inventory for its fiscal years ended 2001 through 2003, and its ongoing internal investigation to identify additional accounting misstatements.   In November 2003, Aerosonic restated over $8.6 million in revenue and inventory-related items for its fiscal years ended 1999 through 2002, and for its first three quarters of 2003.      Nabors has reached a settlement of this matter with the SEC.  Accordingly, concurrently with its Complaint, the SEC filed Nabor's Consent, without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC's Complaint, and proposed Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (Final Judgment), and has requested that the District Court enter the Final Judgment.  The Final Judgment will permanently enjoin Nabors from violating the antifraud provisions, requirements that public companies maintain accurate books and records, and provisions prohibiting public companies from making false filings.  The Final Judgment will further bar Nabors from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will order Nabors to pay disgorgement of $210,200 and civil money penalties of $50,000.   The SEC intends to direct that disgorgement and penalties paid in this case be paid to a Fair Fund for the benefit of defrauded investors, including those who held Aerosonic's shares during the time period alleged in the SEC's Complaint, pursuant to Section 308 (Fair Funds for Investors) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   The SEC's case against McCracken is pending. The SEC's Complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Nabors violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14, thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Aerosonic's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13 (b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, thereunder.   The Complaint also alleges that McCracken violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14, thereunder, and, that he aided and abetted Aerosonic's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13 (b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, thereunder.

Texas)  SEC Charges Stock Promoter Promoters with Fraudulent Scheme  On DecemberÂ 22,2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against three stock promoters, alleging that they violated the registration and resale restrictions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission's complaint alleges that the promoters fraudulently induced friends and family members to purchase large blocks of stock for pennies per share and immediately resold those shares into the public market without providing the full and fair disclosures required by the SEC's registration provisions. The complaint further alleges these promoters hyped the shares through sparn emails, an advertisement in USA Today, a commercial on CNBC, nationwide promotional mailers and by inducing family and friends to create the appearance of market demand, while reselling millions of shares out of their own accounts for substantial profits. According to the complaint, one promoter, Beverage Creations, Inc., sold 1.35 million shares of California-based beverage company CAJ stock on the first day of trading, generating $1.55 million in illicit profits and a 1359% return on its original investment of $100,000.

SEC Sues Three Stock Promoters and their Minnesota-based Entities for Registration and Fraud Violations  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 22, 2008, it added charges against stock promoters Ryan Reynolds, Jason Wynn and Carlton Fleming alleging that they illegally underwrote multiple unregistered public stock offerings in 2007 and early 2008. Previously, on March 13, 2008, the Commission obtained a temporary restraining order against Reynolds, Wynn, Fleming, and their respective entities, Bellatalia LP, Wynn Industries, LLC, and Thomas Wade Investments, LLC for engaging in illegal distributions of Beverage Creations, Inc. stock. The SEC alleged that by this conduct, the defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also charged Wynn, Wynn Industries and Beverage Creations with fraud related to the Beverage Creation, Inc. stock offering.  In its amended complaint, the SEC alleges that Reynolds, Wynn, Fleming, and additional companies under their control purchased stock from ConnectAJet.com, Inc., My Vintage Baby, Inc. and Alchemy Creative, Inc. for pennies per share and immediately began liquidating those shares in the public market at prices grossly inflated by their own promotional activities. The amended complaint adds as defendants Lugano Funds LLC, Wynn Holdings, LLC and Regus Investment Group, LLC, which are companies owned or controlled by Reynolds, Wynn and Fleming, respectively.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Jason Wynn and companies under his control created artificial demand for the stock of ConnectAJet.com, Inc., My Vintage Baby, Inc. and Alchemy Creative, Inc. through various ad campaigns, nationwide promotional mailers and spam emails. While the promotional mailers disclosed that Wynn companies received the stock being touted, they did not disclose that Wynn and his companies intended to sell that stock into the artificially inflated market created by the promotions.  The SEC's lawsuit also names as defendants Beverage Creations, Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Wieden and former Chief Operating Officer Patrick Dado. According to the amended complaint, in a press release on February 21, 2008, Wieden and Dado falsely disclaimed any relationship between Beverage Creations, Inc. and Jason Wynn or companies under his control, even though Beverage Creations, Inc. had sold more than 3 million shares of stock to Wynn Industries, LLC and had other relationships with Jason Wynn.  The SEC alleges that, by these activities, all defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Act, and Wynn, Wynn Holdings, Wynn Industries, Beverage Creations, Inc., Wieden and Dado violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions and civil penalties against all defendants and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from Reynolds, Wynn, Fleming, Lugano Funds, LLC, Wynn Holdings, LLC and Regus Investment Funds, LLC.

352,"U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22102 / July 22, 2007  AAERxxxxxxx -->  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Bert Fingerhut, et al., 07 Civ. 7707 (KNF) (D.N.J.)  SEC Charges Three Former Wall Street Executives with Fraudulent Stock Conversion Scheme   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against three individuals and their relatives alleging that they orchestrated a scheme to defraud the banks and depositors by secretly converting stock in 65 public offerings of banks that were converting from mutual to stock ownership.  According to the Commission's complaint, the scheme was designed to circumvent federal and state banking regulations that require banks to give their own depositor first priority to purchase stock ahead of other interested investors when converting the stock. The complaint alleges that the defendants' scheme generated a total of over $12 million in illegal profits from the conversion of 65 of the oversubscribed offerings, with the vast majority of those profits coming from new investor deposits. Three of these defendants, Robert Danetz, Bruce Finger Hut and Stephen Danetz, are alleged to have been involved in orchestrating the fraudulent scheme. In its complaint filed in federal court in Newark, N.Y., the SEC charged the three defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting the violations of Sections 5(a), 5 (c) and 17 (a)(2) the Investment Advisers Act and the Rule 15a-3 there under. Without admitting or denying the allegations in today's Complaint, all three of them consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038,575 and civil penalties totaling $7.5 million, respectively. Additionally, each defendant agreed to a permanent injunction from participating in any offering of any security, investment, municipal securities, penny stock, or other securities that he or she owns or controls, as required by the federal securities laws. Each defendant also agreed not to violate the anti-fraud and other provisions contained in Section 15(d) or 17(e)(3). In addition, one defendant, Stephen","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20118 / May 16, 2007  AAERxxxxxxx -->  SEC v. Bert Fingerhut et al., Civil Action No. 07-2294 (D.N.J.)   SEC Charges Former Wall Street Executive and Three Others in Scheme to Defraud Savings Banks and Their Depositors in Dozens of Stock Offerings  On May 16, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging four individuals with securities fraud for participating in a decade-long scheme to defraud savings banks and their depositors in connection with the banks' conversion from mutual to stock ownership.  All four defendants have agreed to settle the Commission's charges.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Bert Fingerhut spearheaded a sophisticated scheme to circumvent federal and state banking regulations in order to make lucrative stock purchases in bank conversions.  From January 1997 through January 2007, Bert Fingerhut's scheme generated a total of over $12 million in fraudulent profits from secondary market sales of bank stock illegally obtained in 65 public offerings.  The other three defendants were nominees for Bert Fingerhut who knowingly played active roles in implementing the scheme and profited from their efforts:  Robert Danetz, a childhood friend of Bert Fingerhut; Bruce Fingerhut, Bert Fingerhut's nephew; and Stephen Danetz, Robert Danetz's brother.  The complaint alleges that the defendants made numerous misrepresentations in stock subscription agreements and stock order forms to carry out their fraudulent scheme.  The complaint also alleges that Robert Danetz and Bruce Fingerhut acted as undisclosed nominees and used phony identification cards and other documents in order to deceive the banks.  All four defendants have agreed to settle the Commission's charges.  More specifically, the defendants named in the Commission's complaint are:  Bert Fingerhut, age 63, a resident of both Aspen, Colorado and Palo Alto, California.  From 1965 through 1983, he was associated in different capacities with Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (""Oppenheimer""), then a registered broker-dealer.  Among other positions, he was Director of Research and Executive Vice President and a member of both the Management and Executive Committees of Oppenheimer.  From 1983 through 1988, he worked as an analyst for Odyssey Investors, Inc., a registered broker-dealer formerly affiliated with Oppenheimer.  Robert Danetz, age 62, and a resident of both Teaneck, New Jersey and Roxbury, New York.  He is a retired school teacher.  Bruce Fingerhut, age 38, and a resident of Alexandria, Virginia.  He is a freelance opinion poll researcher.  Stephen Danetz, age 65, and a resident of New York, New York.  He is a real estate attorney.  The Commission's complaint further alleges as follows:  Federal and state banking regulations are designed to ensure that when a bank converts to stock ownership, each of the bank's depositors has a fair chance to purchase stock before other interested investors do so.  Because the demand for shares issued by a converting bank often exceeds the number of shares the bank is selling, banking regulations restrict the number of shares that any one depositor may acquire and prohibit depositors from agreeing to transfer their shares to anyone else before the shares are issued.  The demand for such shares often also causes the shares to trade in the secondary market at a high premium to the initial purchase price.  Accordingly, the chance to purchase shares from a converting bank is often a very lucrative investment opportunity.  The defendants deliberately evaded these and other applicable banking regulations and offering terms contained in the converting banks' prospectuses that imposed maximum purchase limits and prohibited the transfer of depositors' purchase rights.  These priority purchase rights allow the depositors to purchase up to a certain number of shares at a relatively low price, and shares are allocated among depositors according to various criteria if an offering is oversubscribed.  To ensure that only depositors benefit from their priority purchase rights, federal and state banking regulations prohibit depositors from transferring ownership of their purchase rights or from entering into any agreement regarding the sale or transfer of shares purchased in the offering.  Bert Fingerhut funded the opening of accounts in his own name and the names of his nominees at mutual savings banks throughout the country.  When any of the banks undertook a conversion, he secretly funded his nominees' stock purchases, controlled the sale of his nominees' shares and retained most of the trading profits.  He also had the nominees submit stock order forms in which they falsely certified to the banks that they were purchasing the stock for their own account and had no agreement to transfer the shares or the proceeds of their sale.  Bert Fingerhut caused his nominees to make these material misrepresentations in 65 public stock offerings by banks.  The 65 offerings were oversubscribed, and the defendants' misconduct therefore limited the amount of stock available to legitimate depositors, some of whom received less stock than they requested or were completely shut out.  Bert Fingerhut and his nominees made over $12 million from the scheme at the expense of other depositors.  Robert Danetz and Bruce Fingerhut knowingly played key roles in carrying out the scheme, and reaped large profits of their own from their misconduct.  They did most of the legwork to set up the nominee accounts and acted as nominees in numerous offerings.  For years, they traveled the country opening as many accounts as possible, sometimes using phony identification cards and bogus utility bills to satisfy certain banks' in-state residency requirements.  As nominees, they both knowingly made misrepresentations in each of the subscription agreements they signed.  Stephen Danetz, a lawyer, also willingly participated as a nominee for Bert Fingerhut and knowingly made misrepresentations in one of the most profitable conversions targeted by the scheme.  In addition, he was involved in discussions with Bert Fingerhut and Robert Danetz that led Robert Danetz to make false statements to the Commission's staff in an earlier investigation into a similar, unrelated scheme that targeted the conversion of NewAlliance Bancshares, Inc.  All four defendants are charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In the complaint, the Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties.  In a parallel criminal proceeding, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey has announced that it filed criminal charges against Bert Fingerhut for the same conduct.  Earlier today, Bert Fingerhut pled guilty to the criminal charges and, in connection with his guilty plea, agreed to pay a total of $11 million in forfeiture, representing his own illegal profits from the scheme.  In the Commission's action, each of the defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission's complaint, has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, Bruce Fingerhut has agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $181,269, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $150,000.  Stephen Danetz has agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $137,975, plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $120,000.  Because Bert Fingerhut has already agreed to forfeit an amount equivalent to his ill-gotten gains in conjunction with his guilty plea in the parallel criminal case, the consent judgment in the civil case does not require disgorgement of those same ill-gotten gains.  The Commission's claims for civil penalties against Bert Fingerhut and Robert Danetz will remain pending.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in this matter.  The Commission's investigation is ongoing.

353,"On October 22, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two California residents and a California-based certified public accountant for their roles in a Ponzi scheme that raked in more than $1 billion in investor funds.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of California, alleges that Joseph W. Bayliss of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Ronald Roach, a resident of Martinez, CA, fraudulently offered and sold unregistered securities in connection with the sale and sale of approximately 17,600 solar power generation units (generators) to investors. The complaint further alleges they falsely claimed that the Generators were being manufactured and put into use, and that investors paid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits and lease payments to end-users of the generators. In reality, according to the SEC, thousands of these units were never even manufactured, let alone put in use and the vast majority of revenue came from investor money, not from actual leases or sales tax payments. Moreover, in many cases, investors did not receive any of their money from the actual use of those funds, but rather were used to make rent payments and distributions to earlier investors, to fund earlier investor purchases, or to benefit themselves at the expense of investors at other times-poor times. To settle the case, which was filed under seal by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District, Bayalliss andRoach consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3), and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $10,000, $7,500 and $2,140, respectively. They also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and will be prohibited from associating with any investment adviser or broker in an SEC-registered broker.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations in SEC filings, each of them agreed, individually and collectively, that they will each disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil monetary penalties and jointly and severally pay a civil penalty in amounts equal to their respective profits, with each paying a $50,00 penalty and neither agreeing to an accounting or officer-and-director bar for a period of ten years. Each has agreed not to violate Section 17","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against two California individuals for their roles in a multi-year alternative energy tax credit Ponzi scheme run by two California-based companies.  Defendants have agreed to settle the SEC's charges, with monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, Joseph Bayliss, a licensed electrical and general building contractor, and Ronald Roach, a certified public accountant and investment adviser, were integral to a massive Ponzi scheme that raised approximately $909 million from 17 investors between 2011 and 2018.  The complaint alleges that investors were induced by others to invest in tax credit investment contracts and sale leaseback investments through promises of gains in the form of tax credits, guaranteed lease payments, and profits from the operation of mobile service generators.  In reality, the complaint alleges, thousands of the purportedly profitable generators were never even manufactured, let alone put into use, and the vast majority of revenue to investors came from Ponzi-like payments, where funds from new investors were used to pay off old investors, not from actual lease payments.  Bayliss allegedly provided false technical certificates of inspection for generators that he, in fact, never inspected, and, in many cases, for generators that did not exist. Bayliss allegedly knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the certificates that he signed were being sent to and relied upon by investors. Roach allegedly issued compilation reports and accompanying financial statements that falsely reported significant revenue from purportedly real leases.  Roach allegedly knew that these misleading reports and financial statements were being provided to investors.  According to the complaint, defendants each made millions of dollars from the scheme, while investors lost their money.  The SEC's complaint charges defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.  Defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, with monetary relief to be determined by the court on motion by the SEC at a later date.  In a parallel criminal case, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California today announced criminal charges against both defendants.

The complaint further alleges, among other things, that the Defendants took advantage of the investors' desire to buy shares before the companies' shares were publicly traded and sold them securities that were difficult, if not virtually impossible, for outsiders to obtain. According to the SEC, these fraudulent offerings were a scam, with no legitimate purpose other than to give investors the impression that their money was being used to fund the lavish lifestyle of a convicted felon and his mother and wife.

Judge Kevin Castel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, freezes the assets of multiple defendants and relief defendants.   According to the Commission&#8217;s complaint, Florida resident John A. Mattera and several other individuals carried out the fraud using a newly-minted hedge fund named The Praetorian Global Fund.  They falsely claimed that the fund and affiliated Praetorian entities owned shares worth tens of millions of dollars in privately-held companies that were expected to soon hold an initial public offering, including Facebook, Groupon, and others.  Mattera and others solicited investments by, among other things, telling investors that their funds would be safely held in escrow accounts.    In reality, according to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Mattera and his confederates never owned the promised pre-IPO shares in these companies.  The purported escrow service, headed by defendant John R. Arnold of Florida, merely transferred investor funds to personal accounts controlled by Mattera and Arnold.  After Arnold took a cut of the money for himself, he released the money to entities controlled by Mattera, who misappropriated investors&#8217; funds for private jets, luxury cars, fine art, jewelry, and other personal uses. Mattera also transferred money to his mother Ann Mattera and his wife Lan Phan. They are named as relief defendants in the SEC&#8217;s complaint for the purpose of reclaiming investor funds unrightfully in their possession.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Mattera, Bradford Van Siclen, the Praetorian Fund, Praetorian G Power I LLC, Praetorian G Power II LLC, Praetorian G IV, Praetorian G Power V LLC, and Praetorian G Power VI LLC, Arnold, and First American Service Transmittals Inc. with violations, or aiding and abetting violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.  The complaint further charges Mattera, Van Siclen, the Praetorian G entities, Joseph Almazon, Spartan Capital Partners, and David Howard with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act by engaging in the unregistered offering of securities, and Almazon and Spartan Capital with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as unregistered brokers.

SEC CHARGES CITIGROUP INC. WITH CONDUCTING A $50 BILLION PONZI SCHEME   The Securities &#8211;&nbsp;Commission today filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging that, during the summer and fall of 2007, Citi made a series of material misstatements about its investment exposure to sub-prime mortgages.  Specifically, the Commission's complaint alleges that the investment bank's subprime exposure included more than $39 billion of ""super senior"" tranches of mortgage-backed securities and liquidity puts, and thus exceeded billion. According to the complaint, in addition to that amount, as a result of the misstated exposure, approximately $13 billion in ""subprime"" assets were exposed to ""liquidity puts,"" which are collateralized debt obligations that are securities held as collateral for financing provided by the company. The complaint further alleges the amount of that exposure was materially understated in documents provided to investors and analysts in connection with the acquisition of Subprime Mortgage Services (CDOs).  In its complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., the SEC charged that Cigroup violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

July 29, 2010)SEC Charges Citigroup Inc. in Connection with Misleading Disclosures Regarding Its Exposure to Sub-Prime AssetsCompany Consents to Injunction and Payment of a $75 Million PenaltyThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Citigroup Inc. with misleading investors about the extent of the company's exposure to sub-prime mortgage-related assets during 2007.The SEC alleges in its complaint against Citigroup that between July 20, 2007 and November 4, 2007, in response to intense investor interest in the topic, Citigroup repeatedly made misleading statements about the extent of its holdings of assets backed by sub-prime mortgages in earnings calls and public filings. Throughout the period in question, Citigroup represented that its sub-prime exposure in Citigroup's investment banking unit, Citi Markets &amp; Banking, was $13 billion or less, when in fact, at all times during that period, the investment bank's sub-prime exposure was over $50 billion.Citigroup, a global financial services company based in New York City, agreed to pay a $75 million penalty to settle the SEC's charges.The SEC alleges that, beginning in July 2007, Citigroup made a series of statements in earnings calls and public filings in which it represented that its investment bank had approximately $13 billion of sub-prime exposure, and that the investment bank's sub-prime exposure declined over the course of 2007. In fact, the $13 billion figure that Citigroup disclosed omitted two categories of sub-prime-backed assets, ""super senior"" tranches of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and ""liquidity puts,"" through which Citigroup had approximately $43 billion of additional sub-prime exposure. Citigroup only disclosed the extent of its holdings of the super senior tranches of CDOs and the liquidity puts in November 2007, after a sharp decline in their value. According to the SEC's complaint, the misleading disclosures were made at a time of heightened investor and analyst interest in public company exposure to sub-prime mortgages.According to the SEC's complaint, as early as April 2007, Citigroup's senior management began to gather information on the investment bank's sub-prime exposure for purposes of possible public disclosure. From the outset of these efforts, internal documents describing the investment bank's exposures included the super senior CDO tranches and the liquidity puts, while noting that they bore little risk of default. Nevertheless, on four occasions â a July 20, 2007 earnings call; a July 27, 2007 Fixed Income investors call; an October 1, 2007 earnings pre-announcement; and an October 15, 2007 earnings call â Citigroup stated that its investment bank's sub-prime exposure was $13 billion or slightly less, and had been managed down from $24 billion at the end of 2006. The statements made in the October 1, 2007 earnings pre-announcement were included in a Form 8-K that Citigroup filed with the Commission. Citigroup did not disclose in any of these communications that it was excluding the amount of its sub-prime exposure from super senior tranches of CDOs or liquidity puts.Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Citigroup Inc. consented to the entry of a final judgment that (1) permanently restrains and enjoins it from violation of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11 and (2) orders it pay penalty and disgorgement of $75,000,001.Separately, the SEC also instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Gary Crittenden, Citigroup's former chief financial officer, and Arthur Tildesley, Jr., Citigroup's former head of Investor Relations, for their roles in causing Citigroup to make certain of the misleading statements.

Mich.)  The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against Frank J. Bluestein of Oakland, California, alleging that he was the single largest salesperson in a $250 million Ponzi scheme perpetrated by an individual named Edward May and his company, E-M Management Company LLC.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least as early as 1998, and as recently as July 2007, the defendant raised approximately $74 million from approximately 800 investors through approximately 180 purportedly separate private offerings of securities. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of his conduct, he received undisclosed compensation from investors, including $1.4 million in disclosed compensation, for his own personal investment in these offerings, which he used to fund his personal business ventures and to support his wife's retirement and other expenses and for remodeling her home. In a parallel action, on November 20, 2007 the SEC filed an emergency civil action against defendant Edward M. May, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and charging May with aiding and abetting May's and May&#8217;s violations. Without admitting or denying the allegations, May consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future securities law violations and ordering May to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $2,906,767, plus a penalty of $750,000. He also agreed to be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.

Frank Bluestein, Civil Action No. 2:09-CV-13809 (E.D. Mich.) (Friedman, J.)  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Detroit-area stock broker Frank Bluestein with fraud, alleging that he lured elderly investors into refinancing the mortgages on their homes in order to fund their investments in a $250 million Ponzi scheme.  The SEC alleges that Bluestein acted as the single largest salesperson in the Ponzi scheme operated by Edward May and his company, E-M Management Company LLC (E-M).  The SEC previously filed charges against May and E-M in connection with the fraudulent scheme.   The SEC alleges that Bluestein specifically targeted potential investors who were retired or elderly and conducted so-called &#8220;investment seminars&#8221; in Michigan and California to lure them into investing in E-M securities.   The SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that Bluestein facilitated May&#8217;s fraudulent scheme by raising approximately $74 million from more than 800 investors through the sale of E-M securities over a five-year period.  Bluestein, through his company Maximum Financial, conducted numerous investment seminars to find new E-M investors.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Bluestein was very methodical and careful not to discuss the E-M offerings openly during these &#8220;seminars&#8221; in a way that would alert attendees to the fact that they were actually forums to pitch the E-M offerings.  Bluestein first gained the trust of potential investors in attendance by discussing generic financial planning topics and other investment products.  But under the guise of informal conversations, Bluestein would generate talks among attendees who already had invested in E-M offerings.  For instance, Bluestein would often ask if they had &#8220;received their Ed May checks?&#8221; or &#8220;How do you like those Ed Mays?&#8221; in order to drum up discussion of the investments and attract the interest of other potential investors attending the seminars.    The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that Bluestein misrepresented to investors that the investments were low-risk and that he had conducted adequate due diligence with respect to the investments when, in fact, he did little to investigate the legitimacy of the E-M offerings even when confronted with serious red flags about the existence of some transactions.  Bluestein also misled investors about the compensation he was receiving from the offerings by failing to disclose that he received at least $2.4 million in commissions from May and E-M in addition to the $1.4 million in disclosed compensation he received from investor funds.  The SEC complaint alleges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by Bluestein.  As part of this action, the SEC seeks an order of permanent injunction against Bluestein as well as the payment of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and financial penalties.

357,"U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20254 / September 18, 2006   SEC v. Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Richard A. Causey, Civil Action No H-04-0284 (Harmon) (C.D. Tex.) (filed Sept. 18).  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging that, from 1999 through 2001, Lay and others engaged in a multi-faceted scheme to defraud in violation of the federal securities laws.  Lay served as the Chairman of Enron Corp.'s Board of Directors from its formation in 1986 until January 23, 2002, and was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer from that time until 2001. The amended Complaint further alleges that Lay made at least $103 million and $23 million, respectively, in illicit gains and losses, by purchasing EnRON stock at artificially inflated prices at inflated broker-dealer prices. According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal district court in Houston, the defendants made millions of dollars in salary, bonuses and stock sales, while making millions in ill-gotten gains through the sale of his own stock in an effort to conceal the true financial condition and the misperceptions that they had made. As a result of their conduct, they made more than $200 million in illegal profits and over $100 million of illegal gains, including $11 million from a stock sale in which Lay misappropriated millions more in investor funds. In addition to Lay&nbsp;payments for his personal use of investor money, he also allegedly pocketed $1.1 million for a personal gain of $400,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint, all four defendants consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as to pay civil penalties and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon.Lay, Skillings, or others, have agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions. They have also agreed not to violate the registration and reporting requirements of Sections 13(d), 13d, 13","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 18776 / July 8, 2004  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2051 / July 8, 2004  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Richard A. Causey, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay, Civil Action No. H-04-0284 (Harmon) (S.D. Tx.) (July 8, 2004) (Second Amended Complaint)  SEC CHARGES KENNETH L. LAY, ENRON'S FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WITH FRAUD AND INSIDER TRADING  Complaint Alleges Participation in Scheme to Defraud with Skilling, Causey and Others; Seeks Civil Penalty and Recovery of Over $90 Million In Unlawful Proceeds from Stock Sales  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") today initiated civil charges against Kenneth L. Lay, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Corp., for violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, periodic reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. [Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and for aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11].  In this action, the Commission is seeking disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties, a permanent bar from acting as a director or officer of a publicly held company, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission today, subject to the approval of the Honorable Melinda Harman, U.S. District Court Judge, filed a Second Amended Complaint seeking to add Lay to its pending action against Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former President, CEO and Chief Operating Officer, and Richard A. Causey, Enron's former Chief Accounting Officer.  The proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Lay and others engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud by falsifying Enron's publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading public representations about Enron's business performance and financial condition.  In addition, the proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Lay profited from the scheme to defraud by selling large amounts of Enron stock at prices that did not reflect its true value.  The sales also occurred while Lay was in possession of material non-public information concerning Enron and generated unlawful proceeds in excess of $90 million during 2001.  Specifically, Lay sold over $70 million in Enron stock back to the company to repay cash advances on an unsecured Enron line of credit.  In addition, while in possession of material non-public information, Lay amended two program trading plans to enable him to sell an additional $20 million in Enron stock in the open market.  Lay's proceeds from the sales constitute illegal gains resulting from his scheme to defraud.  Specifically, the Commission's Proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges as follows:   Lay's Early Participation in the Scheme to Defraud.  Lay, along with others at Enron, engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud in violation of the federal securities laws.  During 2001, with specific knowledge of rapidly deteriorating performances of Enron's business units, Lay made numerous false and misleading public statements about Enron's financial condition.  As Enron's Chairman and CEO, Lay had oversight of Enron's business units and supervised the senior executives and managers of these units, reviewed drafts of public filings and draft press releases, and participated in conference calls with investment analysts.  In presentations to the investing public, Lay and others heavily emphasized the performance and potential of Enron Broadband Services (EBS) and Enron Energy Services (EES).  To support what Enron had already said about EES, Lay and others concealed massive losses in EES' business through fraudulently manipulating Enron's ""business segment reporting.""  They accomplished this at the close of the first quarter of 2001 through a reorganization designed to conceal the magnitude of EES' business failure, which was known to Lay as early as January 2001.  With Lay's approval, Enron hid that failure from the investing public by moving large portions of EES' business - which Lay and others knew at the time would have to otherwise report hundreds of millions of dollars in losses - into Enron Wholesale, which was the Enron business segment housing most of the company's wholesale energy trading operations and income.  As Lay and others knew, Enron Wholesale had ample earnings to absorb the EES losses, while at the same time continuing to meet its own internal budget targets.  Lay made the false and misleading statements to persuade investors that Enron's profitability would continue to grow, to maintain credit ratings, to influence investment analysts, and to prop up the share price of Enron stock.  Lay knew of Enron's use of structured transactions - specifically prepays and the infamous Raptors - to misstate its financial results.  Enron entered into circular transactions that were characterized as prepay forward contracts in order to disguise borrowings as cash from operations.  Lay was aware of the importance and magnitude of prepay transactions to create operating cash flow and thereby maintain Enron's investment grade credit rating.  Lay was aware that the credit rating agencies were not told the magnitude of Enron's prepay obligations and that this information was not disclosed in Enron's public filings. In addition, Enron created the Raptor structures to ""hedge"" volatile assets against any potential decline in value.  The manner in which Enron structured and funded the Raptors meant that any hedging losses in the Raptors would ultimately be borne by Enron.   Lay understood that Enron used the Raptors for earnings management and that decreases in the price of Enron stock threatened the viability of the Raptors.  Lay Knowledge of Additional Problems Following Skilling's Resignation.  On July 13, 2001, Skilling unexpectedly told Lay he was resigning because he felt there was nothing he could do to stop the decline in Enron's stock price.  On August 14, Enron issued a press release, with Lay's approval, that announced Skilling had resigned for personal reasons.  In a conference call with investment analysts later that same day, Lay repeatedly asserted that, ""there are absolutely no problems that had anything to do with Jeff's departure . . . there are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues . . . unknown, previously unknown problems, issues . . . I can honestly say that the company is probably in the strongest and best shape . . . that it's probably ever been in.""  Regarding EES, Lay offered that ""we've been doubling revenue and doubling income quarter on quarter, year on year for now about the last three years.  We expect that to continue to grow very, very strong. . . .""  After Skilling resigned, Lay met repeatedly with Enron's senior management, who described for him Enron's deteriorating financial condition.  Lay was advised internally of accounting improprieties regarding the Raptors and that various assets and investments were overvalued on Enron's books and records by approximately $7 billion.  During this period, Lay repeatedly received internal financial reports consistent with these problems.  In August and September, senior executives informed Lay that Enron was facing an increasing earnings shortfall, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, a proposed non-recurring charge relating to certain investments, and an accounting error in excess of $1 billion.  Enron's problems were so severe that a senior executive informed Lay that Enron needed to consider being acquired or selling its prized pipelines.   Lay Continued to Mislead the Public - August and September 2001.  Despite specific knowledge of Enron's deteriorating financial condition, Lay continued to make false and misleading public statements about Enron's financial performance.  In meetings with research analysts and in public statements, Lay falsely and misleadingly stated there were ""no accounting issues,"" ""no reserve issues,"" and ""no other shoes to fall"" at Enron.  Lay made a series of false and misleading statements during an Enron employee online forum, including that: ""[t]he third quarter is looking great.  We will hit our numbers.  We are continuing to have strong growth in our businesses,"" ""we have record operating and financial results,"" and ""the balance sheet is strong.""  In addition, Lay misled Enron employees regarding his purchases of Enron stock when he informed them that he had purchased additional shares over the last couple of months.  In making this statement, Lay concealed that he had made net sales of over $20 million in Enron stock in the preceding two months.  The October 16, 2001 Third Quarter Earnings Release.  In a meeting with other senior executives one month prior to Enron's third quarter earnings release, Lay learned that Enron had incorrectly accounted for the Raptor transactions, and as a result, Enron shareholders' equity would be reduced by $1.2 billion.  Lay also knew that the Raptors were being terminated and combined with other pending write-downs that would result in an earnings charge of $1.01 billion.  Specifically, Lay knew that these two items - the $1.01 billion earnings charge and the $1.2 billion reduction of shareholder equity - were unrelated, and that the reduction to shareholders' equity was required whether or not the Raptors were terminated.  Lay reviewed and approved Enron's earnings release that reported a ""nonrecurring"" earnings charge of $1.01 billion, a majority of the charge ($544 million) relating to the early termination of the Raptors.  Lay knew that the characterization of the termination of the Raptors as ""nonrecurring"" losses was erroneous and inconsistent both with advice Enron had received from its auditor and Enron's past treatment of Raptor earnings as recurring operating earnings.  Lay and others intentionally omitted any reference to the $1.2 billion equity reduction from the press release.  In a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings release, Lay falsely stated that ""in connection with the early termination"" of the Raptors, Enron's shareholders' equity would be reduced by $1.2 billion.  Lay did not disclose, as he knew, that the reduction was principally due to a significant accounting error, as opposed to the termination of the Raptors.  Lay's Last Ditch Efforts -- October and November 2001.  In an effort to calm deepening public concern regarding the decline in Enron's stock price, Lay participated in conference calls with analysts and others.  In these calls, Lay made false and misleading statements regarding Enron's financial health.  For example, Lay stated, ""[Enron is] not trying to conceal anything.  We're not hiding anything,"" and ""[w]e're really trying to make sure that the analysts and the shareholders and the debt holders really know what's going on here.  So, we are not trying to hold anything back.""  In a telephone call with a prominent credit rating agency, Lay falsely stated that Enron and its auditors had ""scrubbed"" the company's books and that no additional write-downs would be forthcoming.  In fact, Lay knew that Enron was carrying its international assets at billions in excess of their fair value and that Enron had failed to disclose a $700 million goodwill impairment.  In an all-employee meeting to reassure Enron's employees, Lay falsely described Enron's liquidity, stating that ""[o]ur liquidity is fine.  As a matter of fact, it's better than fine, it's strong. . .""  At the time he made the statement, Lay knew that Enron had been forced to offer its prized pipelines as collateral for a $1 billion bank loan and that the only source of liquidity was a $3 billion line of credit, which was fully utilized on Lay's authority.  In addition, Lay made misleading statements about Enron stock and its prospects.  Lay misleadingly stated, ""as sad as the current market price is . . . [b]ut we're going to get it back"" and ""that doesn't mean we can't get back up to the $80s or $90s in the not-too-distant future.""  At the time he made the statement, with Enron stock trading at less than $20 per share, Lay did not disclose that he had quietly sold over $65 million of Enron stock back to the company during 2001.  Lay's Sales of Enron Stock Back to Enron.  From January 25, 2001 to November 27, 2001, Lay took advances on a non-collateralized $4 million line of credit with Enron in the total amount of $77,525,000.  Thereafter, in twenty separate transactions, Lay repaid the credit line by selling $70,104,762 worth of Enron stock back to the company, at prices he knew did not accurately reflect Enron's true financial condition.  For example, after learning of Enron's undisclosed plan to hide over $500 million in EES losses in ENA, Lay sold 1,086,571 shares of Enron common stock back to the company, in 11 transactions, for a total of $34,081,558.  Following Skilling's resignation on August 14, 2001, at a point when Lay was learning more about Enron's deteriorating financial condition, Lay sold 918,104 shares of Enron common stock back to the company, in five transactions, totaling $26,066,474.  As Lay tried to prop up Enron's stock price following Enron's third quarter earnings release on October 16, 2001, Lay sold 362,051 shares of Enron stock back to the company, in four transactions, totaling $6,050,232.  Enron's shareholders and employees, much less the public, did not learn of Lay's sales of Enron stock back to the company until February 2002, over two months after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection.  Lay also made withdrawals from his line of credit totaling $7.5 million between October 24 and November 27, 2001, at a point when Enron's financial condition was crumbling.  Lay's Sales of Enron Stock Pursuant to Amended 10b5-1 Plans.  On November 1, 2000, Lay established two program sales plans under Commission Rule 10b5-1.  Subsequently, Lay amended both plans.  At the time Lay amended both plans, he was in possession of material nonpublic information concerning Enron's deteriorating financial condition, meaning Lay cannot use the plans as a defense to insider trading charges.  Under the amended plans, Lay unlawfully sold over 350,000 Enron shares for total proceeds in excess of $20 million.    The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Enron Task Force.   The Commission's investigation is continuing.

Joseph P. Nacchio, et al, Civ. No. 05-cv-480-MSK-CBS  (D. Colorado)  COURT ENTERS FINAL JUDGMENT AGAINST FORMER CEO OF QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INT'L JOSEPH P. NACCHIO  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that the United States District Court for the District of Colorado entered a Final Judgment dated January 24, 2011, in a civil action against Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International Inc., a Denver-based telecommunications company. Nacchio, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that enjoins him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; finds that he is liable for disgorgement of $44,632,464, plus interest, which will be deemed satisfied by Nacchio's forfeiture of that amount in the related criminal case, United States v. Nacchio, 05-cr-00545 (D. Colorado); and prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. A civil penalty was not imposed against Nacchio by agreement of the parties in light of the criminal sanctions ordered in the related criminal case and because Nacchio agreed to waive all rights to appeal a criminal fine of $19 million imposed upon him in the related criminal case. It is anticipated that the Commission will ask the Court to add the disgorgement ordered against Nacchio of $44,632,464, plus interest, to a Fair Fund which was established in SEC v. Qwest Communications, Inc., Civ No. 04-cv-1267 (D. Colorado), through which the Commission thus far has marshaled and distributed approximately $275 million to harmed investors.  According to the SEC's complaint in this matter, from at least April 1, 1999 through March 31, 2002, Nacchio and others at Qwest engaged in a large-scale financial fraud that hid from the investing public the true source and nature of the company's revenue and earnings growth. The complaint alleged that, although Qwest publicly touted its purported growth in services contracts which would provide a continuing revenue stream, in fact the company fraudulently and repeatedly relied on revenue recognition from one-time sales of assets known as ""IRUs"" and certain equipment without making required disclosures. The complaint also alleged that Nacchio and others fraudulently and materially misrepresented Qwest's performance and growth to the investing public. The complaint further alleged that Nacchio sold Qwest stock in violation of the insider trading prohibition of the securities laws.  The litigation against the remaining four defendants named in the Commission's complaint is continuing.

359,"The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Rong Chen with insider trading in advance of the acquisition of two China-based companies.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Chen worked as an investment banker for Tsinghua Microelectronics, Inc. (RDA) and its parent company, Ganji.com, based on confidential information Chen obtained from his wife, Yuehong Wang, who worked on the RDA acquisition. The complaint alleges that Chen used her brokerage account to purchase, at a cost of $5,507.68, call options and $19,832 of GANJI stock, on behalf of himself and Wang. Chen sold his options, earning more than $94,400 in illegal profits. Wang and Chen agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations.

360,"On March 29, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Houston, Texas-based pastors with defrauding 29 investors through a fraudulent offer and sale of historical Chinese bonds.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least April 2013 until August 2014, Kirbyjon Hines Caldwell and Gregory Alan Smith, both pastors at Windsor Village United Methodist Church, offered and sold to investors participation rights in various historical or Pre-revolutionary Chinese Bonds which Caldwell claimed to own, control, or possess. In some cases, they told investors that their funds would be used to purchase the bonds and offered credibility to their investment by, respectively, being a well-known pastor and claiming to be an ""investment adviser.""  The SEC alleges that Caldwell, Smith and LDT, LLC, defrauded investors by making material misrepresentations and omissions to them about the safety of the investments, and by failing to tell investors they were receiving compensation for recommending the investment to prospective investors. The complaint also alleges Smith violated the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c), and Section 10(b) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, Caldwell has consented to a permanent injunction and to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. Smith also agreed to an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from association with any SEC-registered broker-dealer. Caldwell will be barred from the securities industry in any capacity, in part for commingling investor funds in his business account and for misappropriating funds from his wife, who liquidated her annuities to invest in this fraudulent offering.Smith and Caldwell have agreed not to violate the federal securities laws and will instead be subject to court approval of any order imposing permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

Caldwell and Smith raised at least $3.4 million from 29 mostly elderly investors, some of whom liquidated their annuities to invest in this scheme. Caldwell and Smith are alleged to have taken approximately $1.8 million of investor funds to pay for personal expenses, including mortgage payments in the case of Caldwell and luxury automobiles in the case of Smith. Offshore individuals received most of the remaining funds.

Lin, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action Number 06-CV-1188 (RCL)   The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles, California alleging that, from June 2002 to September 2003, the defendants facilitated over 12,000 late trades by select institutional customers in over 600 mutual funds. The Commission's complaint alleges that these customers engaged in the fraudulent late trading and market timing of their mutual fund shares.  According to the complaint, NCC's customers, many of whom are institutional investors, were the subject of the scheme and therefore were able to reap at least $8 million in profits from the illegal market-timing of shares by the customers. In addition, as a result of its participation in this scheme, Lewis and his company, JB Oxford &amp; Co. (""JBOH""), made profits of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, by engaging in a series of transactions that were designed to conceal the fraud from their customers and to disrupt the management of certain funds by other customers to accommodate frequent buying and selling of common shares of each fund's stock. These customers also received profits at the expense of long-term shareholders because their shares were not traded at their own value. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants have consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 17 (a), and (c) of Securities Exchange Act and Rules 17a-1, (d) as well as SectionÂ 17(e)(1), (3) or (4) under the Investment Company Act (âAdvisers Act and Section 22(c)(2) promulgated under Section 20(d), which includes a bar prohibiting Lewis from serving as an officer or director of a public company and prohibiting him from participating in any offering of securities that is registered with the Commission or a broker-dealer, offering or offering to sell securities, or any other security that may","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 18850 / August 25, 2004  SEC v. JB Oxford Holdings, Inc., National Clearing Corporation, James G. Lewis, Kraig L. Kibble, and James Y. Lin, Civil Action No. CV 04-7084 PA (VBKx) (C.D. Cal.)  SEC FILES CIVIL FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST JB OXFORD HOLDINGS, NATIONAL CLEARING CORPORATION, AND THREE OFFICERS FOR FACILITATING FRAUDULENT LATE TRADING AND MARKET TIMING  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against Beverly Hills, California-based broker-dealer National Clearing Corporation (NCC), its parent company, JB Oxford Holdings, Inc. (JBOH), and three NCC executives for facilitating late trading and market timing by certain NCC customers.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from June 2002 until September 2003, the defendants fraudulently facilitated thousands of market timing and late trades in over 600 mutual funds.  In addition to the charges against NCC and JBOH, the Commission's complaint names James G. Lewis, age 39, of Santa Monica, Calif., who was JBOH's former president and chief operating officer and NCC's former president and chief executive officer; Kraig L. Kibble, age 44, of La Crescenta, Calif., who is NCC's director of operations; and James Y. Lin, age 46, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., who is NCC's vice president of correspondent services.  The SEC's complaint, filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles, alleges as follows:   ""Late trading"" refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, the time as of which mutual funds typically calculate their net asset value (NAV), but receiving the price based on the NAV already determined as of 4:00 p.m.  Late trading enables the trader to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. but that are not reflected in that day's price.    ""Market timing"" includes (a) frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or (b) buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Market timing, while not illegal per se, can harm other mutual fund shareholders because it can dilute the value of their shares, if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies, or disrupt the management of the mutual fund's investment portfolio and cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate frequent buying and selling of shares by the market timer.   From June 2002 until September 2003, NCC facilitated thousands of late mutual fund trades in more 600 different mutual funds on behalf of select institutional customers.  NCC routinely received trading instructions from customers after 4:00 p.m. EST and executed those trades at the current day's NAV.  NCC facilitated the late trading with the knowledge and at the direction of Lewis, Kibble, and Lin.  NCC entered into written agreements with institutional customers who engaged in late trading and market timing.  These agreements included up to a 1% custodial fee in exchange for facilitating market timing and late trading in mutual funds.  NCC received approximately $1 million in compensation from the scheme while its customers reaped profits in excess of $8 million at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders.  NCC received hundreds of ""kick-out letters"" from various mutual funds which rejected individual market timing trades and attempted to restrict NCC's customers' ongoing market timing activities.  In response to these restrictions, NCC perpetrated a number of deceptive practices to conceal their customers' fraudulent market timing.  When a mutual fund restricted market timing activities, NCC, at the direction of Lewis, Kibble, and Lin, used deceptive means such as opening additional accounts and using new account numbers instead of the previously restricted account numbers; using additional registered representative codes for the same previously restricted representatives; and using additional office identification numbers for the same previously restricted offices.  JBOH reported its financial statements included within its Forms 10-Q and 10-K on a consolidated basis.  Therefore, JBOH reported as revenues the proceeds NCC received from the fraudulent scheme.  Lewis served simultaneously as an executive at JBOH and NCC and signed JBOH's 2002 and 2003 Forms 10-K.    The Commission's complaint charges JBOH, NCC, Lewis, Kibble, and Lin with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  NCC is also charged with violating Rule 22c-1, promulgated under Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  This provision prohibits the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares except at a price based on the current NAV of such shares that is next calculated after receipt of a buy or sell order.  The SEC seeks an order that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the above provisions; requires the defendants to disgorge all their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; requires the defendants to pay civil penalties; and prohibits Lewis from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Moore of the United States Court in Houston, Texas entered an order freezing the assets of Charles Jordan (Jordan), a resident of Houston (Houston), and his business partner, Kelly ""Gibbie"" Gipsson (Gipsons).  The Commission's complaint alleges that from March 2007 through the present, defendants raised over $3.7 million from more than 50 investors in 10 states, including Texas and Oklahoma.  Defendants allegedly promised investors fixed rates of return ranging from 42% to 48% after three and one-half years from the bond settlement date, even if the insured lived beyond the projected life expectancy, or at the earliest, through a life settlement payment to the bonding company, which would pay investors their return if they died within the specified time period. The defendants also allegedly concealed from investors that they were not reserving funds to pay the premiums, that the bonds were illusory and would not be repaid until the insurance company paid the investors a certain amount, when in fact they did not have the money to do so. In addition to misstatements regarding future premium payments, Defendants also concealed the fact that their bonds had a checkered regulatory history and were unlicensed to provide insurance in Texas. Finally, they failed to disclose that in November 2006 Texas regulators issued a cease and desist order against Texas-based Secure Investment Services, Inc. (SIS), which was the subject of a Commission enforcement action on March 23, 2007, in connection with the same conduct alleged in the Commission&#8217;s complaint.

Jordan, Kelly T. Gipson, and ASA LLC, sold fractional ownership interests in a particular life settlement policy to a specific group of investors (""the Policy""), and then failed, without warning or disclosure, to use investors' money to cover the future premium payments on the Policy. Instead of reserving investor funds to pay future Policy premiums, Defendants commingled the funds and used them to pay Defendants' business and personal expenses and to support lavish lifestyles, including payments for jewelry, casinos and other travel and entertainment. The complaint alleges that Defendants enriched themselves with approximately $2.3 million of investor funds. As a result, the Policy lapsed on March 9, 2010. The Commission further alleges that Jordan and Gipson misled investors by falsely claiming that the investments were protected by a bonding company, but failed to disclose to investors significant risks associated with the purported bonding company, including the fact that it is located offshore and is not licensed to provide insurance in the U.S.The complaint alleges that Jordan, Gipson and ASA violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, disgorgement together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

According to the Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, John ""Lawton"" and his companies, including the investment advisory firm, have engaged in a scheme to fraudulently offer and sell investments in the pooled investment vehicle. The complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,500, plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to their respective amounts. In a parallel action, on February 24, a federal court entered a preliminary injunction against the three defendants and issued orders freezing their assets and appointing a temporary receiver over the assets of each of them. As a result, they are subject to court approval of any emergency relief ordered by the Court. This is the first preliminary injunctive relief issued against these defendants in connection with an investment scheme that has raised more than $2.5 million from investors in at least 15 different states. On February 26, 2008, Judge James B. Conte, U. S. District Judge, issued an order temporarily restraining Defendants from committing or engaging in any manner to defraud, directly or indirectly, any person, entity, or nationally, except as a limited liability representative, pursuant to Rule 206(4)-8 of Regulation A, by acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or investment adviser to pooled investments and by, among other things, aiding and abetting the filing of this action.

SEC Obtains Preliminary Injunction In Minnesota Hedge Fund Fraud Case    The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced that on February 25, 2009, a preliminary injunction and other relief was entered, by consent, in the U.S. District Court of Minnesota against Paramount Partners, LP (""Paramount""), a hedge fund, Crossroad Capital Management, LLC (""Crossroad""), Paramount's investment adviser, and John W. Lawton (""Lawton""), who runs Crossroad.  The Commission's complaint, filed on February 18, 2009, alleges that Paramount is a hedge fund in which approximately 50 to 60 investors, many of whom live in Minnesota, have invested as much as $9 million.  The complaint alleges that Lawton, a resident of San Francisco, California, and Crossroad have engaged in a fraud in which they misrepresented Paramount's assets and returns to investors.  The complaint alleges that the defendants represented to investors that Paramount has produced annual returns of 65% to 19% since 2001.  The complaint alleges that in January 2009, defendants sent account statements to investors that reflected investments totaling about $17 million as of December 31, 2008.  The complaint alleges that, in fact, Paramount only had $5.3 million of assets in its accounts at that time.  The complaint alleges that as of February 13, Paramount's assets amounted to less than $2 million, and that defendants withdrew $900,000 in January.   The complaint further alleges that when the Commission requested documents from the defendants to verify defendants' claims about Paramount's assets, the defendants provided account statements showing a false $12 million account balance in a brokerage account that had long been closed.  In the Order, the Honorable Judge Ann Montgomery preliminarily enjoins Paramount, Crossroad, and Lawton from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 [Section 17(a)] and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder], and Crossroad and Lawton with respect to violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder] and aiding and abetting of Crossroad's violations of those provisions by Lawton.

Friedman's Inc., 05 Civ. 1754 (E.D.N.Y.)  SEC CHARGES FRIEDMAN'S INC. FOR FRAUDULENT ACCOUNTING SCHEME  On May 12, 2006, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that, from 2001 to 2003, Friedman&#8217;s employed various methods of accounting fraud to misrepresent to the public its financial performance. The complaint alleges that the Company employed a variety of improper accounting practices to conceal the true extent of its uncollectible debt. For example, in its annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended September 28, 2002, it stated that it ""adheres to strict and conservative accounting principles in granting credit and non-discretionary standards in writing off bad debt."" In fact, as the level of bad debts rose, its write-off procedures enabled the company to avoid taking written-offs and to defer increasing its allowance for doubtful accounts above 10% at the end of fiscal years 2001 and 2002. In addition to manipulating its credit program and improperly accounting for receivables that had already been written off in order to reduce improperly its cost of sales.  The Complaint further alleges, among other things, that as a result of these practices, and in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, those financial statements materially overstated the financial results for each of those years. Specifically, these financials include:  (i) false claims about the accuracy and success of Friedmanâs credit programs; (ii) inaccurate statements concerning the use of certain ""one off” accounting devices to inflate earnings artificially and improve its balance sheet, including: (1) prematurely recognizing merchandise discounts from suppliers in an effort to lower the cost-of-sales expense; and (2) improperly recording the sale of receivable that should have been recognized immediately.&nbsp;   In connection with the filing of this complaint, on May 20, 2003 a federal district court in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order against","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No.  19477 / November 30, 2005 Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2351 / November 30, 2005  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.

The Complaint alleges that from at least fiscal year-ended 2001 through September 2003, at the direction of Friedman&#8217;s&#8217; former senior management, Friedman&#8217;s systematically inflated earnings to meet Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, while concealing the fact that a growing percentage of its credit accounts receivable were likely not collectible.  The Commission alleges that Friedman&#8217;s made material misrepresentations concerning its credit program and its write-off policy, and systematically under-reserved for bad debts using various non-GAAP accounting practices.  The Complaint further alleges that from at least fiscal year-ended 2001 through September 2003, Friedman&#8217;s used certain &#8220;one-off&#8221; actions to manipulate its earnings and improve the appearance of its balance sheet, including, among others: (i) prematurely recognizing as a reduction in its cost of sales merchandise discounts that Friedman&#8217;s received from its suppliers; (ii) failing to account properly for the sale of receivables that Friedman&#8217;s had written off; and (iii) using certain related party transactions to capitalize expenses that Friedman&#8217;s should have recognized immediately.          The complaint charges Friedman&#8217;s with violating Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

According to the Commission's Complaint, in December 1999, McMahon and others participated in a fraudulent transaction involving $12 million in cash flow from operations. The Commission alleges that the transaction was intended to address the growing imbalance between the operating earnings and the capital markets, but McMahon failed to disclose that it was a result of structured financings and debt-like obligations that had nothing to do with the operations or trading business. In addition, the complaint alleges, during the relevant time period, as Treasurer and President and Chief Operating Officer, he directed the reporting and disclosure of this transaction to rating agency analysts. McMahon also misled the agency's auditors into believing the transactions were ""myths"" and ""fact"" that they were not true. As Treasurer, under the direction of McMahon's successor, former Chief Financial Officer and CFO, John Rymas, issued a series of materially false statements in connection with these statements. Among other things:  McMahon knew, among other facts, that he had been pressured to keep the information he provided from his conversations with ratings agencies, including those of Moody's and S&P, from being disclosed to investors.&nbsp; McMahon was responsible for maintaining and maintaining the relationships between these relationships.

McMahon simultaneously settled with the Commission without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. District Court, McMahon has agreed to a permanent injunction and to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for five years. In addition, McMahon will pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $150,000 and a civil penalty of $150,000.  Specifically, the Commission's Complaint alleges that McMahon participated in a fraudulent transaction involving the ""sale"" of an interest in Nigerian power generating barges to Merrill Lynch that allowed Enron to improperly report $12 million in earnings in the fourth quarter of 1999. Enron never should have recorded profits from this purported sale because the risks and rewards of ownership in the barges never passed to Merrill Lynch due to an oral side agreement made by McMahon and others. The Complaint also alleges that while serving as Enron's Treasurer from April 1998 through March 2000, McMahon made false and misleading statements to the national credit rating agencies regarding Enron's financial position and cash flow. The Complaint alleges that the false and misleading statements included statements about Enron's cash flow from operations that failed to disclose that a portion of such cash flow was a result of structured financings and debt-like obligations that had nothing to do with Enron's operations or trading business. In addition, the Complaint alleges that McMahon made additional false and misleading statements to the rating agencies after he became Enron's Chief Financial Officer on October 24, 2001 through Enron's bankruptcy filing in December 2001.  McMahon has agreed to be enjoined permanently from violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting the violation of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13.  In settlement of this action, McMahon also consented to the entry of an Administrative Order, pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, with a right to reapply after three years.

AND ITS PROFESSIONALS   The Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United State District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the investment companies of the U. States pension trust corporation and its principal, Iliana Maceiras, for conducting a fraudulent scheme to defraud investors by charging them exorbitant, undisclosed commissions and fees in connection with the sale of mutual funds. The complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the federal securities laws by making material misrepresentations and omissions in their offering materials. In addition, the Commission charged that, from at least December 1995 to the present, USPT, through its network of unregistered sales agents, has defrauded investors in Latin America by offering and selling securities through a series of ""investment plans"" that provide prospective investors with a choice of making either annual contributions for multiple years or a single, lump-sum contribution. Through this fraudulent offering fraud, investors can expect to receive a total of more than $178 million in returns from investments made through the mutual fund companies, and the fees charged to investors are typically based on the amounts invested in each investment plan, rather than the amount invested as represented by the funds' actual and projected amounts. As a result, investor funds have been siphoned off, as much as 70% to pay commissions to US-Pension Trust Corporation and 10% of its net profit, or 5 to 5 percent of USP Trust's insurance premiums, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Coral Gables, Florida. Additionally, on each initial annual plan contribution, UPT charges as-is a fee of 1.5% per year, which is approximately one-half the value of each individual's investment. These fees are not disclosed to existing investors, who are required to make additional contributions under their annual plans - the vast majority of investors have agreed to participate in USAP Trust by falsely claiming that its investments are subject to government regulation.

The Commission's complaint alleges that from at least December 1995 to the present, USPT has operated as an unregistered broker-dealer and has defrauded approximately 14,000 investors by charging exorbitant, undisclosed commissions and fees in connection with the sale of mutual funds, in violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Using a network of independent sales agents, USPT offers prospective investors residing primarily in Latin America the opportunity to invest in a variety of mutual funds available from well-known U.S. fund companies (and at least one hedge fund), through a trust created at a U.S. bank on behalf of each investor. Touting its experience and ""high quality financial products,"" USPT offers and sells mutual funds through a series of ""investment plans"" that provide investors with a choice of making either annual contributions for multiple years or a single, lump-sum contribution to remain invested for at least ten years. Among other misrepresentations, USPT and its principals have failed to disclose that they are taking as much as 85% of investors' contributions in the annual plan, and 12% of contributions in the lump-sum plan, to pay undisclosed exorbitant commissions, fees and a ""net profit"" to USPT.  The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges USPT with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Iliana Maceiras, Leonardo Maceiras Jr., and Nildo Verdeja with aiding and abetting USPT's Section 15(a) violations. In addition to permanent injunctions against further violations, the Commission is seeking an order than the defendants disgorge ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and an order imposing civil money penalties.

367,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against James E. Hengen for insider trading in the securities of two companies, USMD Holdings, Inc. and Surgical Care Affiliates Inc., based in Mirmetonka, Minnesota.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, alleges that in summer 2016, while working as a vice president of human capital at a UnitedHealth Group Inc.-based healthcare provider, he misappropriated from his wife material, non-public information that the company was in negotiations to acquire the companies. According to the complaint:  On the morning of August 30, 2015, the day of January 9, 2017, a definitive agreement was reached between the U.S. health care provider and its largest customer. The day after the acquisition was announced, shares of the stock increased more than 16% on heavy trading and closed at $56.65 per share.&nbsp;  In breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his employer and to protect his family, and his brother and three coworkers, all of whom sold their stock shortly before the announcement, made approximately $8,340 in illicit profits from trading on the insider tips. On December 27 and 28, 2016 and December 30 and 31, both before and during the same time period, HENGEN purchased in his personal account 3,160 shares in a total of over $30,000 of stock that he sold at an average price of $54.25 per day. By the end of December 2016 he had sold his stock for $31,489, which was his largest profit since the beginning of 2017. In a parallel action, on November 8, 2018, Unitedhealth announced that it had entered into an acquisition agreement with its partner, Abbott & Company, that would allow the two hospitals to be acquired by a third healthcare company.Â  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Weissman and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Kurt L. Gottschall of The New York Regional Office.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged James E. Hengen with insider trading based on material, nonpublic information that he misappropriated from his wife, a human resources executive at a healthcare company who worked on corporate acquisitions.  The SEC alleges that Hengen, whose wife worked for a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Inc., misappropriated material, nonpublic information concerning UnitedHealth's pending acquisitions of two companies, USMD Holdings, Inc. and Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. According to the complaint, Hengen learned of the pending acquisition of USMD in June 2016 when he overheard one of his wife's phone calls while she was working from home. In breach of his duty to his wife, Hengen then purchased USMD stock based on that information and tipped four other individuals, who also purchased the stock. After the acquisition was announced in August 2016, the price of USMD stock increased, and Hengen sold his stock, realizing profits of $32,315. His tippees, who also sold their stock, realized profits of $8,340. Six months later, Hengen again misappropriated information from his wife, this time concerning UnitedHealth's pending acquisition of Surgical Care, and purchased stock in that company. After the acquisition announcement in January 2017, the price of Surgical Care stock increased, and Hengen sold his stock, realizing $31,489 in illicit profits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Minnesota, charges Hengen with violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Hengen consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $63,804, prejudgment interest of $3,865, and a civil penalty of $72,144.

368,"On October 31, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Thomas J. Buck, a former financial advisor employed by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Buck executed a fraudulent scheme to obtain excessive commissions and fees by making material misrepresentations and omissions to certain customers and investment advisory clients regarding the fees or commissions charged in their accounts, impermissibly exercising discretion to place certain trades in customer accounts without obtaining authorization from the customer. The complaint further alleges Buck made false and misleading statements to some of his customers about the amount of commissions that he had paid to them, and failed to inform his clients that the total annual commissions were exceeding certain internal thresholds, when in fact they exceeded the amounts that were promised to him. According to the complaint, Buck then traded in those accounts and received in excess of $2.5 million in commissions from at least 50 customers in connection with the scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, Defendant has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) or (4) under the registration provisions and ordering him to pay disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. In addition, in a separate action filed in federal court in Chicago, Illinois on October 30, Judge James B. Perillo entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against Buck and an order freezing the assets of all defendants and prohibiting Buck from participating in any offering of penny stock, securities, or certificates of deposit. As part of this action, an officer-and-director bar has been placed on administrative leave pending a hearing on the Commission's motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions, as well as the appointment of an administrative officer and a director of any SEC-registered broker-dealer or investment adviser, for a period of five years. Under the settlement, which is subject to court approval, defendants will disgorge their ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interests, with a $25,000 civil penalty.","A former Merrill Lynch broker has agreed to pay more than $5 million to settle SEC charges that he fraudulently schemed to increase his personal income by obtaining excessive commissions and fees from investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, Merrill Lynch paid financial advisors a portion of the commissions, fees, or other revenue they generated in customer and client accounts.  The SEC alleges that Thomas J. Buck represented to certain customers with commission-based accounts that the total annual commissions they paid would not exceed certain limits, and then he traded in those accounts and generated commissions that exceeded the amounts he promised.  The SEC alleges that Buck failed to inform the customers that their total annual commissions were exceeding the promised limits and falsely represented to several customers that their total annual commissions were within the promised limits.  According to the SEC's complaint, Buck also intentionally failed to inform the customers that a fee-based option could be cheaper compared to the total annual commissions being paid based on trades executed in an account.  The SEC also alleges that Buck impermissibly exercised discretion by placing trades in the accounts of certain customers without authorization.  According to the SEC's complaint, Buck received more than $2.5 million in excessive commissions and fees from at least 50 retail customers and investment advisory clients in a scheme that lasted at least three years.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis charges Buck with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act.

Michael Strauss, Stephen Hozie and Robert Bernstein, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No 1:09-CV-2984 (JAP)  SEC CHARGES THREE FORMER OFFICERS OF AMERICAN HOME MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORP. WITH ACCOUNTING FRAUD  On May 13, the Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212;Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the federal district court in Manhattan, charging the former chairman, chief executive officer and president of American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. (ARM) with accounting fraud and related violations.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 1999 through the first quarter of 2007, ARM raised approximately $90 million through a May 4, 2007 offering of shares to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (""Citigroup"").  According to the complaint, Strauss was ARM's largest shareholder and CEO and served as chairman and chief financial officer. The complaint further alleges Strauss and his two top officers, former controller and officer-and-director respectively, made or caused ARM to make misleading public statements and omitted material information, including: concealing the fact that the majority of its $7.6 billion MBS portfolio was originated without income verification; failing to disclose that ARM had sold a large amount of the portfolio held at March 31 in 2007 in order to meet its pressing undisclosed liquidity needs; and overstating the company's available cash and liquidity in an April 30 2007 earnings press release and conference call and in its Form 10-Q.&nbsp;   Rather than report the devastating impact these defaults would have on ARM and its financial results, as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Strauss received about $3.5 million in compensation in 2006, and $700,000 in salary and bonus. Bernstein received $1.3 million, based on his $2 million salary, for his role as controller of ARM. In addition, he received a $4.1 million margin loan from an existing credit line that was collateralized by ARM shares and wired these funds to a personal bank account at another financial institution.

Michael Strauss, Stephen Hozie and Robert Bernstein, Civil Action No.  09-CV-4150 (RB)  (S.D.N.Y. April 28, 2009)  On April 28, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against former senior officers at American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., Michael Strauss, Stephen Hozie and Robert Bernstein. The Commission alleges that Strauss and Hozie engaged in accounting fraud and made false and misleading disclosures that were designed to conceal from investors that American Home Mortgage's financial condition and prospects had significantly worsened in the first four months of 2007.  The complaint alleges that Strauss and Hozie fraudulently understated American Home Mortgage's first quarter 2007 loan loss reserves by tens of millions of dollars, converting the company's loss into a fictional profit. In fact, as Strauss and Hozie knew, the company's own analysis showed that American Home Mortgage needed significant additional reserves. The analysis also showed that the company's losses on its delinquent second liens were mounting quickly and that American Home Mortgage would lose at least 72% of the value of these loans after the properties went through foreclosure. Strauss and Hozie knowingly failed to reserve adequately for the expected losses caused by these delinquent loans.  According to the SEC's complaint, Strauss and Hozie made misleading disclosures concerning, among other things, the riskiness of the mortgages the company originated and held and the company's liquidity. Strauss and Hozie also failed to disclose the fact that, during the month of April 2007, American Home Mortgage was forced to sell the majority of its multi-billion dollar mortgage-backed securities portfolio to meet pressing liquidity demands. The complaint further alleges that Strauss, Hozie and Bernstein misled American Home Mortgage's auditor about the adequacy of the reserves.  The complaint alleges that Strauss and Hozie violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges (i) Strauss and Hozie with aiding and abetting American Home Mortgage's violations of Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-11 of the Exchange Act; (ii) Strauss, Hozie and Bernstein with aiding and abetting American Home Mortgage's violations of the reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions under Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; and (iii) Strauss, Hozie and Bernstein with direct violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder. Finally, the complaint charges Strauss and Hozie with violations of the officer certification provisions under Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and the imposition of civil penalties. The complaint also seeks officer and director bars against Strauss and Hozie.  Strauss has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. He will be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, record-keeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws and will pay approximately $2.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $250,000 penalty. Strauss will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The litigation is ongoing with respect to the other defendants.

In addition, they have misrepresented the prior investment performance and rates of return of those unrelated companies, even though they did not actually exist as alleged in the complaint.

The SEC alleges that Weitzman either sold securities held in the clients' accounts or redeemed shares held in money market funds in order to acquire cash for the unauthorized transfers, because the clients' brokerage accounts at the broker-dealer generally did not hold more than a minimal amount of cash. He also siphoned money from clients' Individual Retirement Accounts. Once he had the looted funds under his control in the AFW bank account, Weitzman either withdrew the clients' funds or transferred the money directly into one of his personal bank accounts.  According to the SEC's complaint, Weitzman in some instances misappropriated funds from AFW clients who were unlikely to be scrutinizing their account statements. For example, Weitzman misappropriated a total of approximately $430,000 in a series of unauthorized transfers from a client who was terminally ill. Weitzman later misappropriated $85,000 in two separate unauthorized transfers from the account of the client's widow. Furthermore, the SEC alleges that Weitzman targeted an elderly couple with compromised mental capacities, misappropriating approximately $400,000 of their money.  The SEC's complaint charges Weitzman with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 204 and Rules 204-2(a)-3 and 204-2(a)(7) also of the Advisers Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, an asset freeze, a sworn accounting, an order prohibiting the destruction of documents, and a requirement that Weitzman notify the SEC and obtain approval of the court before he files for bankruptcy protection.  Weitzman agreed to settle the SEC's claims and, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment that will grant the SEC the full relief that it seeks, but will defer the determination of the financial amounts of the settlement until a later date. The agreement to resolve the SEC's action is subject to approval by the court.  The SEC's investigation is continuing.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against a Simpsonville, South Carolina man and his company, Success Trust and Holding, LLC.  According to the Commission's complaint, from as early as May 2005 through the present, the defendants have raised approximately $2 million from at least 500 investors by offering and selling fraudulent interests in three investment programs, each of which offered exorbitant returns from investments in vaguely described &#8220;banking processes&#8221; which do not exist. The complaint alleges that the Defendants falsely claimed that each program pays projected rates of return ranging from 10% to 480% per year, and that an investment in each Program is either guaranteed or risk free. In fact, a risk-free investment is neither guaranteed nor guaranteed. As a result of the scheme, investors have been left with no legitimate recourse but to use their money for their own use. Success and Reynolds have offered investors the opportunity to participate in one of these schemes. Investors can learn more about the fraudulent programs by using the free and simple search tool on the SEC's investor.gov website.

Paul Reynolds and Success Trust and Holding LLC, Civil Action No. 1:06-CV-1801-RWS (NDGA August 2, 2006)    The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today that it has filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Archie Paul Reynolds a/k/a Dr. A. Paul Reynolds (Reynolds) and Success Trust and Holding LLC (Success Trust). The complaint alleges that Reynolds represents himself to be Success Trust's founder, main trustee, sole officer, and Chairman. In addition, the complaint alleges that Success Trust is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Simpsonville, South Carolina.   The complaint further alleges that, from as early as May 2005 through the present, Reynolds and Success Trust have raised millions of dollars from at least 500 investors by fraudulently offering and selling interests in three investment programs. The complaint alleges that the investment scheme is comprised of three separate Programs -- a Real Estate Program, a Best Efforts 480% Annual Return Program, and a Private Party Loan Agreement. The largest program, the Real Estate Program, in which more than $2 million was invested, projected exorbitant returns from investments in vaguely described ""banking processes"" which do not in fact exist. These processes were often described in vague and confusing terms which make little or no economic sense. The complaint alleges that Reynolds and Success Trust lured investors with offering materials that falsely claim that each Program pays projected rates of return ranging from 10% to 480% per year and that investments are guaranteed or risk-free. In addition, the complaint alleges that Success Trust's Programs resemble ""Prime Bank"" frauds.   The Complaint alleges that the defendants have violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   On August 2, 2006, the Court issued an order granting the Commission's requests for (i) a temporary restraining order; (ii) an asset freeze; (iii) an accounting of all funds raised; (iv) an order requiring repatriation of any offshore funds; and (v) an order expediting discovery and preventing the destruction of documents. The Commission's complaint also seeks (i) preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations; (ii) disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; and (iii) imposition of civil penalties. The Court scheduled a hearing on August 9, 2006 to determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction.

Dragon, United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Civil Action No 3:10-cv-01186-BTM (POR)  SEC Charges Former Senior Vice President of Research and Development for Sequenom, Inc. With Misleading Statements and Misrepresentations in Stockprices and Press Releases   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the federal district court in San Diego, charging a former senior vice president of research and development forSequenome Inc., with misappropriating material misstatements and omissions in connection with the company's Down syndrome test.  According to the SEC's complaint, on at least four occasions between June 2008 and January 2009, ElizabethA.Dragon, the former vicepresident of product development and research for sequencing data analysis for a California biotech company, told the public that her diagnostic test could detect the presence of multiple false chemical or biological features in a fetus' uterus. However, she knew that the test was 100% accurate, making it much less marketable. The SEC alleges that Dragon's false claims about the accuracy of the Down Syndrome test were false because it was not 100 percent accurate and could not be relied upon to detect a serious problem. As a result, her stock price fell by more than $6.5 million the next day, from $14.91 to $3.62, and she was terminated in September 2009.Â Dragon has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13a-3 thereunder, as well as to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In addition, Dragon has consented to an order requiring her to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of these provisions and to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.

Dragon (""Dragon""), the former Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Sequenom, Inc., lied during at least three public events where she made presentations to analysts and investors. She claimed that the test could predict whether a fetus had Down syndrome with almost 100 percent accuracy. However, the Commission alleges that Dragon knew the test was far less accurate than she claimed publicly. When Sequenom later announced that it was no longer relying on the data that Dragon presented and the test would not be launched as planned, the company's stock price plummeted by approximately 76 percent.The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that Dragon presented materially misleading scientific data about Sequenom's prenatal screening test for Down syndrome. The Commission alleges that she falsely claimed that the test's highly accurate results were obtained on a ""blinded"" basis, meaning that scientists did not know whether the fetus had Down syndrome at the time they tested the maternal blood sample.However, the Commission alleges that Dragon provided her scientists with the known outcomes of the samples, which allowed them to manipulate the data in order to produce more accurate results. The complaint alleges that Dragon falsified the number of samples allegedly tested by Sequenom and that she lied about how well the test worked, claiming that it produced unambiguous results. In reality, the complaint alleges, the test results were often difficult to interpret, which is why she needed to ""unblind"" the known outcomes to her scientists.Without admitting or denying the Commission's charges, Dragon has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The Court will determine the amount of a financial penalty to be paid by Dragon at a later date.

According to the Commission's complaint, between April 18,2001 and June 182001, Gerlant, age 47, of Malvern, Pennsylvania, learned material, nonpublic information about the company from his uncle, Christopher M., age 36, the former Director of Taxes and Manager of Budgeting & Performance Analysis at Allied. The complaint further alleges that during the relevant time period April - June 2001, BernardBernabeI, at all relevant times, regularly spoke on the phone with Gerlot. In addition to personal visits and phone calls, he often saw each other regularly as he was working on due diligence relating to a potential merger transaction between Allied and Allied, and that he learned of GerLant's uncle's work at Sun Source and learned about his own back problems as an employee.

Diane Karaoulis, Civil Action No. 06 CV 2768 (RMB) (SDNY Apr. 10, 2006)  Commission Files Settled Insider Trading Charges Against Four Individuals for Tipping and Trading in SunSource, Inc. Stock    The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed three settled insider trading actions against three former employees of SunSource, Inc. and the nephew of one of those individuals.  In complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Commission alleged that Patrick I. Garvey, Diane Karaoulis, and Christopher M. Bernabei violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by purchasing SunSource, Inc. stock in advance of the June 19, 2001, announcement of a merger agreement between SunSource and Allied Capital Corporation and that Kenneth Gerland violated these provisions by tipping Bernabei.  Each of the defendants, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, has consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing injunctive and other relief.  In the action against Gerland and Bernabei, the Commission alleged that, in April 2001, Gerland, who was SunSource's Director of Taxes and Manager of Budgeting &amp; Performance analysis, began working on due diligence relating to the potential merger of SunSource and Allied.  As further alleged in the complaint, from April through June 18, 2001, Gerland knowingly or recklessly provided his nephew Bernabei with material, nonpublic information about SunSource in breach of the duty of trust and confidence that he owed SunSource and its shareholders.  Starting on April 18, 2001, and continuing through June 18, 2001, Bernabei purchased a total of 4,450 shares of SunSource stock based on the information provided to him by Gerland.  Following the announcement of the merger agreement, SunSource's stock price rose $4.54 per share over the prior day's closing price and closed at $9.50 per share on June 19, 2001.  Bernabei sold most of his SunSource shares that day, realizing trading profits of $20,670.  Bernabei has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, ordering him to disgorge $24,774.91 in trading profits plus pre-judgment interest, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,670.  Gerland has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,670.  In the action against Garvey, the Commission alleged that he was a part-time consultant to SunSource who worked on due diligence for the proposed merger with Allied beginning in April 2001.  Previously, senior management of SunSource had informed Garvey that he was precluded from trading in SunSource stock because of a potential transaction that was being considered.  While working on the due diligence, Garvey purchased 400 shares of SunSource stock on June 1, 2001.  According to the complaint, Garvey knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that he had learned about SunSource's merger with Allied was material, nonpublic information and that trading in advance of the announcement of the merger agreement breached the duty that he owed to SunSource and its shareholders.  By trading in advance of the announcement, Garvey had profits of $1,740.  Garvey has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, ordering him to disgorge $2,048 in trading profits plus pre-judgment interest, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,740.  In the action against Karaoulis, the Commission alleged that she was the secretary to SunSource's chief financial officer and that senior management informed Karaoulis that she was precluded from trading in SunSource stock, due to the potential transaction.   As a result of her position, Karaoulis knew of the ongoing merger negotiations between SunSource and Allied.  According to the complaint, Karaoulis's spouse bought 255 shares of SunSource stock on April 12, 2001, at her direction.  The complaint alleges that Karaoulis knew or was reckless in not knowing the information that she had learned about SunSource's merger with Allied was material, nonpublic information and that directing her spouse to trade in advance of the announcement of the merger agreement breached the duty that she owed to SunSource and its shareholders.  As a result of the trading in advance of the announcement, Karaoulis had profits of $1,428.  Karaoulis has consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining her from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, ordering her to disgorge $1,847 in trading profits plus pre-judgment interest, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,428.

Solar Group S.A., et al., United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action Number: 06-CIV-1051 (D.N.Y.)  On November 7, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the federal district court in Manhattan, charging solar energy company Solar Energy, Inc. and its principal trader, James J.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, from January 2001 through July 2005, Defendants engaged in illegal short selling in connection with approximately one hundred seventy-six public offerings, by using shares purchased in those offerings to cover short sales made during the five business days before the pricing of the offerings. According to the complaint, these illegal sales resulted in profits of nearly $1 million from the illegal trading.

Todd, charging them with violating Rule 105 of Regulation M of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 105 prohibits covering a short sale with securities obtained in certain public offerings when the short sale occurs during a specific period (usually five business days) before the pricing of the offering. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Solar Group and Todd have agreed to settle the Commission enforcement action by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Rule 105, and holds them jointly and severally liable to disgorge $1.1 million in trading profits and prejudgment interest, and to pay a $500,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's complaint alleges that, from January 2001 through July 2005, Solar Group and Todd violated Rule 105 in connection with approximately 176 public offerings by using shares purchased in those offerings to cover short sales made during the restricted period set by Rule 105. The complaint further alleges that in the offerings, the offering price was usually set at a discount to the last reported sale price of the stock before the pricing of the offering. As alleged in the complaint, by short selling just prior to pricing, Solar Group often sold shares short at prices higher than the price it would later pay for the shares in the offering. By engaging in this conduct, the complaint alleges, Solar Group significantly reduced its market risk of investing in public offerings and realized profits that totaled nearly $1 million.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, charges Sullivan with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sullivan consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,470.

District court in Charlotte, North Charlotte against a Charlotte-based investment adviser and its general partner for misappropriating at least $807,000 of investor assets.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, from April 1999 to December 2003, Vincent B.Lenarcid Jr. and his investment advisory firm, QMA Investment Management LLC (QMA), raised almost $2.5 million by offering and selling limited partnership units and representing to investors that partnership proceeds would be used to purchase listed securities or money market instruments.&nbsp; According to the Complaint, in connection with these fraudulent transfers, NewVision, which has approximately $16 million under management, owns and controls Fundamental Growth Investors, LP (Fundamental Growth), a hedge fund that is based in and operates as a general investment fund.

The SEC's complaint alleges that, starting in 2016, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation presented himself to the SEC as some one involved in a scheme to manipulate the market of microcap stock publicly-traded by purchasing shares from one of HD View's significant shareholders, with whom the Undercover had previously arranged the matching sell order. The complaint further alleges the undercover told the agent that he was working on a deal involving a stock traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, and wanted to create the appearance that the stock was actively trading. This matched trade almost doubled HDView's stock price.&nbsp;  In a parallel action, on March 3, 2020, a federal district court in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of the two defendants and ordered them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a $50,000 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the allegations, both defendants consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""). The court also entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of Sections 5, 5 and 21(d)(A). The order also prohibits the Defendants from participating in any offering of a penny stock, pursuant to Section 13(e) the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13e-2. In addition, all defendants have agreed to disgorge their gains with interest and pay civil monetary penalties of up to $1.5 million, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by each defendant, based on their respective financial condition.","On March 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced securities fraud charges against a U.K.-based broker-dealer and its investment manager in connection with manipulative trading in the securities of HD View 360 Inc., a U.S.-based microcap issuer.  The SEC also announced charges against HD View's CEO, another individual, and three entities they control for manipulating HD View's securities as well as the securities of another microcap issuer, West Coast Ventures Group Corp.  The SEC further announced the institution of an order suspending trading in the securities of HD View.  These charges arise in part from an undercover operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which also resulted in related criminal prosecutions against these defendants by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.  In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Beaufort Securities Ltd. and Peter Kyriacou, an investment manager at Beaufort, manipulated the market for HD View's common stock.  The scheme involved an undercover FBI agent who described his business as manipulating U.S. stocks through pump-and-dump schemes.  Kyriacou and the agent discussed depositing large blocks of microcap stock in Beaufort accounts, driving up the price of the stock through promotions, manipulating the stock's price and volume through matched trades, and then selling the shares for a large profit.  The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou alleges that they:  opened brokerage accounts for the undercover agent in the names of nominees in order to conceal his identity and his connection to the anticipated trading activity in the accounts suggested that the undercover agent could create the false appearance that HD View's stock was liquid in advance of a pump-and-dump by ""gam[ing] the market"" through matched trades executed multiple purchase orders of HD View shares with the understanding that Beaufort's client had arranged for an associate to simultaneously offer an equivalent number of shares at the same price A second complaint filed by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleges that in a series of recorded telephone conversations with the undercover agent, HD View CEO Dennis Mancino and William T. Hirschy agreed to manipulate HD View's common stock by using the agent's network of brokers to generate fraudulent retail demand for the stock in exchange for a kickback from the trading proceeds.  According to the complaint, the three men agreed that Mancino and Hirschy would manipulate HD View stock to a higher price before using the agent's brokers to liquidate their positions at an artificially inflated price.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Mancino and Hirschy executed a ""test trade"" on Jan. 31, 2018, coordinated by the agent, consisting of a sell order placed by the defendants filled by an opposing purchase order placed by a broker into an account at Beaufort.  Unbeknownst to Mancino and Hirschy, the Beaufort account used for this trade was a nominal account that was opened and funded by the agent.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that, prior to their contact with the undercover agent, Mancino and Hirschy manipulated the market for HD View and for West Coast by using brokerage accounts that they owned, controlled, or were associated with –including TJM Investments Inc., DJK Investments 10 Inc., WT Consulting Group LLC – to effect manipulative ""matched trades.""  The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also charged Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, and penny stock bars from Beaufort and Kyriacou.

El Paso Corporation, Civil Action No.: 1:08-CV-9168 (SDNY)  SEC Charges Houston Oil Company With Violating the Books and Records and Internal Controls Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  The Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging Houston-based The Coastal Corporation (El Paso) with violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of FCPA when it indirectly caused approximately $5.5 million in illegal surcharge payments in connection with its purchases of Iraqi crude oil from third parties under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (UODP). The complaint alleges that, from approximately June 2001 through June 2002, the company, through its subsidiary, The Corporate Division, engaged in a kickback scheme to purchase Iraqi oil. According to the Commission's complaint:  From approximately September 9, 2000 through September 12, 2001, two senior executives met in Baghdad with the Director General of SOMO to discuss the Iraqi demands for surcharges of $0.10 per barrel, or $201,877, on Coastal's behalf, for 21.4 million barrels of oil under contracts. The third party agreed to pay a $200,000 penalty, which was to be paid in installments to a bank in Jordan and Lebanon. As a result of this conduct, El-Paso violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this Commission filing, ELP consented to an order permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and imposing civil penalties. In a related administrative proceeding on January 29, 2009, a federal district court in Houston, Texas entered a temporary restraining order against El PASo and its predecessor entity, San Diego Oil Corp., from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 12(a)(1), (2), 13e-11, (3), 16(A), 17(B)","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19991 / February 7, 2007   Securities and Exchange Commission v. El Paso Corporation, Civil Action No. 07CV00899 (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against El Paso Corporation For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program - - Company Agrees to Pay $7.7 Million  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against El Paso Corporation (El Paso), a Texas-based energy company, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The Commissions complaint alleges that from approximately June 2001 through June 2002, El Paso, and its predecessor in-interest The Coastal Corporation, indirectly made approximately $5.5 million in illegal surcharge payments to Iraq in connection with its purchases of crude oil from third parties under the U.N. Oil for Food Program.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  However, beginning in August 2000, officials of Iraqs State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO), began demanding illegal kickbacks.  The kickbacks were made in the form of surcharges, and were sent to Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan and Lebanon.  According to the Commissions Complaint:  In September 2000, The Coastal Corporation  which merged with an El Paso subsidiary in January 2001 - received its first surcharge demand from a SOMO official.  An El Paso consultant and former Coastal official arranged a $201,877 surcharge payment on the companys behalf, which was made to an Iraqi-controlled account at Ahli Bank in Jordan.  After receiving notice from SOMO that all oil contracts would include surcharges, El Paso ceased direct purchases from SOMO.  Instead, it continued its purchases through third parties.  Beginning in June 2001, El Paso entered into fourteen additional third-party transactions involving fifteen contracts to purchase some 21.4 million barrels of oil.  Approximately 25 to 30 cents of every barrel was illegally kicked back to Iraq by third parties.  El Pasos oil traders had to factor the surcharge into their oil price, and there are recorded conversations of the companys officials and traders discussing the surcharges.  El Paso knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that $5.5 million in illegal surcharges were made on those contracts, and passed back to El Paso in premiums.  El Paso failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments.  Although El Paso inserted a provision in some contracts requiring the third party to represent that it had not paid surcharges, El Paso failed to conduct due diligence to ensure that surcharges were not paid.  Recorded conversations reveal El Pasos knowledge that the provision was entirely ineffective.  In one conversation, a third party that indicated he was willing to pay illegal surcharges to Iraq indicated that he would be equally willing to sign a false certification denying the payment.  El Pasos accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed properly to record the nature of the companys payments.  In at least fifteen transactions, a portion of the companys price for oil constituted kickbacks to Iraq.  The company failed to so designate those payments, characterizing them instead simply as part of the cost of goods sold.  El Paso ceased its oil trading and refinery business entirely by March 2004.  El Paso, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissions complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $5,482,363 in profits, and to pay a civil penalty of $2,250,000.  El Paso will satisfy its disgorgement obligation by forfeiting $5,482,363 pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.  Since being approached by the Commissions staff, El Paso has cooperated with the Commissions investigation, which is continuing.  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee.

(&#8220;California Amplify&#8221;), a manufacturer of microwave components for home satellite systems. The Commission alleges that from November 1999 through January 2001, through his conduct as controller and in possession of material, non-public information that the company was materially overstating its reported financial results by more than $7.8 million. According to the complaint, in March 2001 on the day before the Company's annual audit was to begin, Kuskky confessed to his fraud. In a handwritten note provided to Company officials, he admitted to concealing expenses and making the ""P+L look better."" The false financial statements were subsequently reported to California's auditors, who then found the fraud to be false and misleading. As a result of his scheme, California Amplifier overstated its net income by $1.58 million, $79 million and $117 million for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001.

SEC SUES BARRY KUSATZKY, FORMER CONTROLLER OF CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER, INC., FOR ACCOUNTING FRAUD AND INSIDER TRADING   CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER ISSUED AGAINST CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER, INC.  On April 28, 2004, the Commission filed an injunctive action against Barry Richard Kusatzky (""Kusatzky""), alleging that during the period November 1999 through January 2001, Kusatzky, the former controller of California Amplifier, Inc. (""California Amplifier""),  engaged in accounting fraud and insider trading.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Kusatzky caused California Amplifier to materially overstate income and equity in its quarterly and annual financial statements for the period November 27, 1999 through November 25, 2000, by hiding $7.8 million in Company expenses.  Kusatzky accomplished this fraud by fabricating financial statements and falsifying the Company's books and records.  Kusatzky also concealed his fraud by presenting false records to California Amplifier's auditors.  According to the Complaint, in January 2000, before his fraud was discovered, Kusatzky illegally profited from his misdeeds.   At that time, with full knowledge of his wrongdoing, Kusatzky exercised all his vested options and sold all his 15,000 shares of California Amplifier stock while in possession of material, non-public information that the Company's earnings were materially overstated.  The Complaint alleges that at the time of his insider sales, Kusatzky knew that California Amplifier's earnings for the quarter ended November 27, 1999 were materially overstated because he was solely responsible for overstating them.  Kusatzky's illegal sales enabled him to avoid losses of over $350,000.  The Complaint also alleges that in March 2001, on the day before the Company's annual audit was to begin, Kusatzky confessed to his fraud.   In a handwritten note provided to Company officials, Kusatzky admitted to hiding expenses and to making California Amplifier's ""P+L look better.""  The Complaint alleges that Kusatzky's ""confession"" neither revealed the extent of his misstatement of California Amplifier's financial statements, nor acknowledged his insider trading.    The Complaint alleges that Kusatzky violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act""), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aided and abetted California Amplifier's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting future violations of these provisions, disgorgement, including prejudgment interest, and civil penalties pursuant to Sections 21(d)(3) and 21A of the Exchange Act, and Section 20(d)(1) of the Securities Act.  The Commission also seeks an order barring Kusatzky from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a related proceeding, on April 29, 2004, the Commission issued a settled Order against California Amplifier.  The Order finds that during fiscal 2000 and much of fiscal 2001, California Amplifier failed to establish or maintain internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that its financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"").  This lack of adequate internal controls allowed Kusatzky to commit fraud, caused the failure of the company to discover that Kusatzky was not a CPA. as he had represented, resulted in books and records that failed to accurately reflect the company's transactions, caused numerous other accounting errors, and caused California Amplifier to file materially false and misleading periodic reports with the Commission.  The Order requires that California Amplifier cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Oil for Food Program. The kickbacks were called ""afier-sales service fees"" in Iraq. According to the Commission's complaint, the two entities authorized the payments through third-party agents and consultants in order to facilitate the Iraqi government's purchase of goods for humanitarian purposes. In addition, two companies' subsidiaries paid kick-backs to Iraqi ministries in return for undisclosed commissions. As a result of these illicit payments, a total of more than $1.6 billion was lost from the company's books and records and the sale of assets.

Akzo Nobel, N.V., Civil Action No. 07-CV-02293 (D.D.C.) (HHK)  SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against Akzo Nobel N.V. For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program &mdash; Company Agrees to Pay Over $2.9 Million  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Akzo Nobel N.V., a Netherlands-based pharmaceutical company, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from 2000 to 2003, two of Akzo Nobel's subsidiaries authorized and made $279,491 in kickback payments in connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the ""Program"").  The kickbacks were characterized as ""after-sales service fees"" (""ASSFs""), but no bona fide services were performed.  The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions.  It allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account.  The kickbacks paid in connection with Akzo Nobel's subsidiaries' sales to Iraq bypassed the escrow account and were paid by third parties to Iraqi-controlled accounts in Lebanon and Jordan.  According to the Commission's Complaint:  Akzo Nobel's subsidiary Intervet International B.V. entered into one Program contract involving a kickback payment of $38,741.  During the Program, Intervet conducted business in Iraq through two separate agents, who were paid jointly on all Iraqi contracts.  In August 2000, the agents' fees were 2.5 percent each.  In September 2000, one of the agents informed Intervet that the Iraqi ministry required that Intervet make a five percent kickback under a Program contract under negotiation.  Although Intervet initially refused to make the payment, at the contract signing, an Intervet employee who was aware of the kickback demand saw the agent deliver an envelope to one of the Iraqi representatives.  Shortly thereafter, the agent sought reimbursement of the five percent kickback made on the contract.  In order to reimburse the agent for the kickback while not accurately reflecting the true purpose of the payment in the company's books and records, the Intervet employees agreed to revert to Intervet's pre-August 2000 commission arrangement with its two agents, giving each agent a five percent commission.  By doing so, the agents could keep the 2.5 percent they were each entitled to receive and the agent who paid the kickback could be reimbursed for the five percent passed on to the Iraqi ministry.  Akzo Nobel's subsidiary N.V. Organon entered into three contracts that involved the payment of $240,750 in ASSF payments.  The same agent that worked on the Intervet transaction was involved in each of these transactions.  On the first contract, Organon and the Iraqi ministry agreed on an initial contract price.  However, when Organon prepared the contract documents that were approved by the U.N., Organon inflated the contract price by ten percent to cover the ASSF payment.  On the two subsequent contracts, Organon simply agreed with the Iraqi ministry on an initial contract price that was inflated by ten percent, and then submitted that inflated contract price in the U.N. documents.  An Organon employee created backdated price quotes that matched the pricing reflected in the three contracts.  The agent's commission was increased from five percent to fifteen percent to account for the ten percent kickback.  On the first contract, the agent requested that Organon pay ten percent of his commission to an entity called ""Sabbagh Drugstore.""  On the remaining two contracts, the agent requested that Organon pay the extra ten percent commissions directly to an account in his name.  The Organon employees were aware that the contract price submitted to the U.N. was inflated by ten percent and that the increase in the agent's commission resulted in money going directly to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, also known as Kimadia.  Akzo Nobel knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were either offered or paid in connection with all of these transactions.  Akzo Nobel failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent the payments.  Akzo Nobel's accounting for these transactions failed properly to record the nature of the company's payments, and characterized the ASSFs as legitimate commission payments to the agent.  Akzo Nobel, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $1,647,363 in profits, plus $584,150 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  Akzo Nobel will also enter into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.  Akzo Nobel's former subsidiary will enter into a criminal disposition with the Dutch Public Prosecutor pursuant to which it will pay a fine.  The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Akzo Nobel, which self-reported, and cooperation afforded the Commission staff in its continuing investigation.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from April 4 to April 14, 2016, M. Yin traded in five brokerage accounts held by a group of relief defendants living in Beijing, China, including his elderly mother and father, and a natural resources manager, in order to reap more than $29 million in illicit profits from their illegal trading. The complaint also names as relief defendant Lizhaa Su, Zhiging Yin, Jun Qin, Yan Zhou and Bei Xie, who also allegedly traded on the basis of material, non-public information about a potential acquisition by another company. According to the complaint, after the markets closed on Apri126, Comcast Corporation announced that it would acquire Dreamworks at a price of $41 per share, causing the stock price to rise 47.3% from $27.12 to $39.95per share. During that three-week period in April, these five individual trading accounts collectively bought nearly 2.15 million shares of the company's stock, realizing over $30 million of illegal profits. These trades accounted for 16.9% of a total total of approximately $40 million. In a parallel action, on March 29, 2018, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants' assets and ordered the repatriation of all ill-gotten gains from the alleged trading, plus prejudgment interest and civil money penalties. On March 31, 2020, Judge Soto entered an order temporarily restraining the traders from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the books and records and internal controls provisions, Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 of Regulation G, which, among other things, bars defendants from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally-recognized statistical rating organization, from committing or causing any violation of federal securities laws, pursuant to Section 21(d)(5). The court also froze the assets of those defendants and their companies and appointed a receiver to collect and marshal investor funds to preserve","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained an emergency court order freezing brokerage accounts holding more than $29 million in illegal profits from insider trading in advance of the April 2016 acquisition of DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. by Comcast Corp.  The SEC alleges that in the weeks leading up to the news of the acquisition, Shaohua (Michael) Yin amassed more than $56 million of DreamWorks stock in the U.S. brokerage accounts of five Chinese nationals, including his elderly parents. DreamWorks stock price rose 47.3% once the acquisition was announced.  In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleged the five accounts reaped $29 million from the DreamWorks trades. The complaint also alleges the accounts profited from other suspicious trading in another U.S.-based company and three China-based companies ahead of market-moving news.  Yin, a partner at Summitview Capital Management Ltd., a Hong Kong-based private equity firm, allegedly did not trade in DreamWorks stock through his own account but instead traded through five accounts from addresses in Beijing and Palo Alto and on a computer that also accessed Yin's email accounts.  On February 10, Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze of the five brokerage accounts and issued an order to show cause why an injunction and other relief should not be issued. A hearing has been scheduled for February 17.  The SEC's complaint charges Michael Yin with securities fraud and names the holders of the five brokerage accounts - Lizhao Su, Zhiqing Yin, Jun Qin, Yan Zhou and Bei Xie - as relief defendants.

Kerr and China Investment Group Ltd., Civil Action No- CV-02-2384 (CGC) (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California)  SEC CHARGES LOS ANGELES-BASED COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL FOR FRAUD  The United States Securities Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a Los Angeles-based company and its principal, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the securities laws in connection with a fraudulent offering and sale of securities in the company's stock. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in California, alleges that, from at least January 2000 through the present, the defendants have engaged in an unregistered offering of stock in a number of microcap issuers, and that the funds raised from the offering are intended to be used to fund the purported growth in China's publicly-traded securities. According to the complaint:   (1) the scheme is ongoing.&nbsp;  In its complaint filed on January 11, 2001, in Los Altos, Calif., the Commission charged that a L.A.-based investment adviser and his company, Chang International Investments, Inc. (also known as Changi Investments), raised approximately $1.5 million from investors by offering them a series of thinly traded shares of their preferred stock, which were then sold at artificially-charged prices. In addition to engaging in illegal insider trading and selling of those shares, Kangi also allegedly made false and misleading statements to investors, including statements that he had made to prospective investors about the value of his investments, that his clients' holdings would be returned to them at a later date, when the shares would no longer be sold, would not be traded on the open market and would instead be held in cash, rather than the stock as represented by the SEC's Complaint. This conduct violated Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1).

William R. Kerr and China Investment Group, Ltd., Civil Case No. 02-9659 (U.S.D.C., C.D. Ca.)   On December 19, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a securities fraud case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California charging a former stockbroker and his California company with promoting a fraudulent ""prime bank"" investment scheme.  The defendants are William R. Kerr of Los Angeles, California and China Investment Group, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation headquartered in Los Angeles.  The Commission's complaint alleges a massive securities fraud orchestrated by William R. Kerr and his company, the China Investment Group, Ltd. (""CIG"").  According to the complaint, Kerr induced more than sixty investors throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, to invest over $12 million in his fraudulent investment program that he falsely promised would yield exorbitant returns within a matter of weeks or months.  The complaint further alleges that, in furtherance of this scheme, Kerr posed as a wealthy, politically connected businessman and made numerous false and materially misleading representations to his investor victims and to various intermediaries who he knew would echo his false claims to other investor victims.  These false and materially misleading representations, according to the complaint, included claims (i) that Kerr had control of a $200 million trust; (ii) that Kerr could use the trust as leverage to trade in medium term bank notes (""MTNs""); (iii) that this MTN trading would yield profits of more than 13,000% of the amount invested; (iv) that Kerr's company, CIG, conducted the MTN trading; (v) that the World Bank supported Kerr's trading program; and (vi) that Kerr's investment program was safe and was backed by Kerr's personal guarantee.  Further, the complaint alleges that, instead of investing his victims' funds as he had represented, Kerr misappropriated it, and failed to return either profits or principal to his investor victims.  The Commission's complaint charges both defendants with securities fraud, sale of unregistered securities, and acting as an unregistered broker-dealer, in violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.  The Commission is seeking injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (with interest), and civil penalties against both defendants.  In a related matter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California announced Kerr's agreement to enter a guilty plea to mail fraud and securities fraud charges stemming from the same fraudulent scheme that is the subject of the Commission's complaint.  See United States v. William R. Kerr, No. CR 02-1281 (C.D. Cal.).  The Commission's related case against four Virginia unregistered brokers who solicited investor victims for Kerr's fraudulent program as well as other, similar fraudulent programs, announced previously, is pending.  See Lit. Rel. No. 17281 (December 19, 2001).

Bancinsurance Corporation and John S. Sokol, Civil Action No.: 09-CV-02155 (D. Ohio)  SEC CHARGES BANCINSURANCE CORPORATION AND ITS PRESIDENT WITH FRAUDULENT FINANCING SCHEME   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Banca Insurer Corporation, an Ohio-based insurance company. The complaint alleges that, from approximately 2001 through 2004, the company failed to account properly for more than $2 million of reinsurance claims and failed, or was reckless in not understanding, that the claims were required to be included in Bâs financial statements. As a result of the conduct alleged, as set forth in its complaint filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio on November 19, 1999, and unsealed today, it has agreed to pay over $1.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties to settle the Commission&#8217;s charges.  According to the complaint, on or before March 11, 2004 and shortly before the Company filed its Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sokols was notified by the Board of Directors of a bail and immigration bond program as a reinsurer. On or about March 25, 2003, B&amp;l received invoices from the board of directors for $900,000 in additional claims. According, these claims represented losses of approximately $10 million, which were greater than the amount of its prior claims for that quarter.

(November 16, 2009)  SEC Charges Bancinsurance Corporation and its Senior Executive with Securities Fraud  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action against Ohio insurance company Bancinsurance Corporation (""Bancinsurance"" or the ""Company""), and its chief executive officer, John S. Sokol (""Sokol""), charging them with securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission's complaint alleges that Bancinsurance failed to account properly for more than $2 million of reinsurance claims, and that Sokol-Bancinsurance's president at the time-failed to ensure that the Company's principal financial officer or its external auditors were informed of the claims. As a result, the Company's financial condition in its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2003 and its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was materially misstated. Sokol agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty, and both Bancinsurance and Sokol agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges: During the period 2001 through 2004, Bancinsurance participated in a bail and immigration bond program (the ""Program"") as a reinsurer. On or before March 11, 2004, shortly before Bancinsurance filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2003, Bancinsurance and Sokol were notified that the Company would receive more than $1 million in reinsurance claims under the Program. Sokol understood, or was reckless in not understanding, that these claims represented 2003 losses and therefore were required to be reflected in Bancinsurance's fiscal 2003 financial statements. Sokol failed to ensure that the Company's principal financial officer or its external auditors were informed of the claims. As a result, the claims were not properly recorded in the Company's books and records, which caused Bancinsurance's 2003 financial statements to materially understate the Company's expenses and loss reserves.  The complaint further alleges: On or about March 25, 2004, Bancinsurance received invoices for more than $1 million in additional claims. Sokol understood, or was reckless in not understanding, that these claims were required to be included in Bancinsurance's financial statements filed with its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Sokol again failed to ensure that Bancinsurance's principal financial officers or its external auditors were informed of the claims. As a result, the claims were not properly recorded in Bancinsurance's books and records, which caused its financial statements for that quarter to materially understate the Company's expenses.  Without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, Bancinsurance agreed to be enjoined from violating Sections 10(b),13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Without admitting or denying the complaint's allegations, Sokol agreed to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2; and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

Graycort Financial, LLC, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action Number 06-2501  SEC CHARGES SAN FRANCISCO-BASED FINANCIAL FUND WITH INSIDER SHORT SELLING SCHEME   The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212;Commission today charged San Francisco-based private investment fund GrayCort with insider trading that netted the fund over $100,000 in illegal profits.  According to the Commission's complaint, in connection with two public offerings in 2005 and 2006, the private fund used shares it purchased in the open market to cover short sales made shortly before the offerings were priced. In doing so, it violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, which seeks to prevent traders from exerting downward pressure on the market price of securities by executing long-term securities holdings and aggressive opportunistic trading. The Commission alleges that, because the offering shares were sold at prices below market value, a ""long"" position generally exists when a trader is deemed to own a security and the security will typically sell at a discount to its current price. Thus, such improper short selling activity can artificially drive down the price for securities, thus harming both the issuer and market by inhibiting the capital raising process. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or any reasonable basis for its allegations, all defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $68,909, for a total amount equal to $1,078,879 in profits from unlawful trading in securities of issuers' securities and a $36,556 penalty for any person to sell stock short in a public offering for less than the amount of shares they purchased at the time of their purchase or sale.

Graycort Financial, LLC (Graycort) agreed to settle the charges by disgorging its improper trading profits and paying a $100,000 penalty. The Commission's complaint alleges that Graycort violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, a Commission rule that prohibits covering certain short sales with shares obtained in a public offering.  Such practices are prohibited because they distort the market, potentially allowing traders to lock in profits while driving down the price of the security. According to the complaint, Graycort violated Rule 105 on two separate occasions in 2005.  Graycort sold short the stock of public companies Nutrisystem, Inc. and Perini Corporation, and then purchased shares in the companies' public offerings at prices below its previous short stock sales.  Graycort next entered into a series of offsetting stock purchase and sale transactions in the open market.  The Commission alleges that these transactions had no legitimate economic purpose or substance and served merely to disguise the fact that Graycort used offering stock to cover its short sales in violation of Rule 105.  Graycort's violative trading strategy netted illicit profits of $105,465. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, charges that Graycort violated 17 C.F.R. § 242.105(a)(1).  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Graycort has agreed to settle the matter by disgorging $105,465 in unlawful profits plus prejudgment interest, paying a $100,000 civil penalty, and consenting to an injunction against future violations.

SEC Charges New York-Based Investment Adviser in Multi-Million Dollar Ponzi Scheme   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission (Commission) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of NY, alleging that, from January 1978 through at least February 2009, Philip ""Philip"" Barry (""Barry"") and his entities, including his investment advisory firm, used millions of dollars in investor funds to fund his own speculative real estate ventures.  According to the Complaint, Barry made a number of misrepresentations to lure investors to invest in or to maintain their investments with him. For example, he falsely represented to investors that he would use the investors' money to trade in options or other securities, while claiming to employ a proven trading strategy to protect investors from loss and generate a guaranteed rate of return, which he arbitrarily determined to be 12.55 percent per year in recent years. Instead of delivering on these promises and promising returns of as high as 21 percent in 1979, the defendants used investor money for their own personal use and to pay for related mortgages, taxes, improvements and legal expenses, among other misstatements. Finally, they allegedly diverted some of the funds they invested to Barry's unrelated business, a charitable trust. The Commission's complaint alleges that Barry violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 206(1) under the Investment Advisers Act (Adviser Act).

SEC Charges New York-Based Money Manager in $40 Million Ponzi Scheme    The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Brooklyn money manager for running a $40 million Ponzi scheme in which he promised approximately 800 investors guaranteed high returns from safe, liquid investments, but instead spent their money on real estate, his pornography mail order business, and other interests.  The SEC alleges that Philip G. Barry and his firms Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services defrauded investors, including senior citizens and retirees, by selling securities in Leverage investment funds.  According to the Commission's complaint, Barry provided fake account statements to investors that recorded growing account balances and concealed that Barry had not been trading securities at all for several years.  Neither Barry nor any of his related firms is registered with the SEC in any capacity.  The SEC alleges that Barry and his firms made numerous and varied misrepresentations to induce investors to invest in or to maintain their investments with the Leverage investment funds.  For example, Barry falsely represented that he would use the investors' funds to trade in options or other securities.  In addition, Barry falsely told investors that he would use a proven trading strategy to protect investors' principal and generate guaranteed returns of as much as 21 percent per year.  As alleged in the complaint, these purportedly guaranteed rates of return were simply numbers arbitrarily selected by Barry.  Barry also misrepresented to some investors that their investments in Leverage would be protected from loss by privately obtained insurance and/or by the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC).  Barry told investors that they could liquidate their investment at any time and withdraw their funds, after providing Leverage with a few weeks notice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that, by approximately 1999, Barry had ceased investing any of his investors' funds in options or other securities.  Instead, the Commission alleges that Barry ran a Ponzi scheme in which he used incoming investor money to repay other existing investors and diverted the remaining investor funds for his own personal use.  According to the Commission's complaint, Barry spent the money by purchasing real estate in his own name and those of other entities he controlled, paying expenses of a separate mail order business that sold pornographic materials, and supporting his lifestyle.  The SEC's complaint charges Barry, Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and financial penalties against all defendants.  Barry, Leverage Group, Leverage Option Management Co., Inc, and North American Financial Services, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment that will grant the SEC the full relief that it seeks, but will defer the determination of the financial amounts of the settlement until a later date.  The agreement to resolve the SEC's action is subject to approval by the court.

The Defendants have agreed to settle the charges by consenting to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, imposition of civil penalties","UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 17259 / December 5, 2001  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. GEORGE P. MATUS AND PETER T. MATUS, CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:01CV359-PB, (USDC/Eastern District of Texas)  On December 4, 2001, the Commission filed an insider trading case against a senior officer of Carreker Corporation and his brother.  Named as defendants were George P. Matus, a senior vice president of Carreker and his brother, Peter T. Matus, a licensed stockbroker.  According to the Commission's Complaint, the Matus brothers obtained $209,940 in illegal trading profits by trading on inside information concerning Carreker's May 22, 2001, announcement that the company would miss its first-quarter earnings estimate.  The defendants are:     George P Matus, age 33, a resident of Allen, Texas, and Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Carreker, a Dallas, Texas, based company traded on the Nasdaq stock market.   Peter T. Matus, age 27, a resident of Holladay, Utah, and brother of George Matus.  Peter Matus is a registered representative with a brokerage firm.  The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, and has been assigned to Judge Paul N. Brown.  Specifically, the SEC alleges that George Matus had advance knowledge of Carreker's negative earnings news and participated in both the drafting of the press release announcing the negative news and the decision as to when to release the news.  However, rather than maintain the confidentiality of the news and abstain from trading in Carreker stock, George Matus conveyed the confidential negative information to his brother and transferred $50,000 to him in order to trade in Carreker securities and profit from the non-public information.  Pursuant to their plan, Peter Matus then used his brother's funds to purchase 750 Carreker put options, effectively betting that the price of Carreker shares would decline once the negative news was made public.  Predictably, upon release of the negative news, the price of Carreker stock declined-- by approximately 28%.  When brother Peter sold the options a week later, the price had declined more than 40%, netting the brothers a profit of over $200,000.  In its lawsuit, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunctions, disgorgement of illegal profits and pre-judgment interest, a penalty under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, against George Matus and Peter Matus for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in connection with illegal insider trading while in the possession of material, non-public information.   The SEC is also seeking an officer-and-director bar against George Matus, to prohibit him in the future from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company.     &nbsp;SEC Complaint in this matter.",0.5395,0.4659

Thompson, with accounting fraud in connection with the company's acquisition of Behavioral Health Care Associates, LLC (""BHCA"").  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that, from at least 2013 through the 2015 period, Defendants misrepresented the financial condition of the Company, its subsidiaries, and the revenues it reported in public filings and private solicitations.  Defendants also falsely claimed that the acquisition never took place, that Acceleracorp paid no more than $1.7 million to acquire BH CA and that it would not be consolidated into any financial statements at all, when, in fact, it did not do so. The complaint also alleges, as a result of Defendants' misrepresentations of Accelerac's financial results, Acceleracentre's publicly reported revenues for 2013 and 2014 were materially overstated by Defendants and by defendants' use of unregistered broker-dealers to conceal the true financial state of Acceleracy's operations and technology services business. In addition to the alleged accounting violations, defendants also violated Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 13(a), 13a-1 and (c) and 15(j) the Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions and ordering him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty of $5,500, which will be deemed satisfied by the entry of a permanent injunction and an officer-and-director bar by a federal court in Chicago, Illinois.Â  The settlement is subject to court approval.The SEC previously filed a related action in federal district court against Accelerace's former CEO and CFO, John F.

The SEC's complaint, filed on September 29, 2016, alleges that Accelera Innovations Inc.'s public filings included the revenues of a separate company that it did not own or control and, as a result, Accelera improperly inflated its annual revenue by up to 90 percent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Accelera portrayed itself as a provider of software when, in reality, it was not providing software to anyone.  Geoffrey Thompson, Accelera's founder, allegedly signed Accelera's annual reports.  The complaint also alleges that Thompson, acting through Accelera and Synergistic Holdings LLC, sold approximately $1.7 million worth of Accelera stock to investors, and that the sale was not registered or subject to any exemption from registration.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charge:  Accelera, Thompson, and Synergistic with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933;&nbsp;  Accelera and Thompson with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder;&nbsp;  Accelera with violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and&nbsp;  Thompson with aiding and abetting Accelera's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.   The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, an officer-and-director bar against Thompson, and penny stock bars against Thompson and Synergistic.  The SEC separately charged John Wallin, Accelera's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with signing certifications as to the accuracy of Accelera's Forms 10-K and 10-Q that falsely attested that he had reviewed Accelera's financial statements when he had not.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Wallin with aiding and abetting Accelera's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder and with violating Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wallin agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and permanently bars him from acting as an officer or director.  The judgment also provides that the amount of any civil penalty will be determined by the court at a future date.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC also separately charged Daniel Caravette, of St. Charles, Ill., with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  Caravette's alleged violations involved sales of stock in Accelera and a Canadian company founded by Thompson which claimed to be involved in medical marijuana production, distribution, infusion, research, and testing.  The SEC found that Caravette's transactions violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Caravette agreed to the entry of an order requiring him to cease-and-desist from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, to pay a total of $307,724.78, consisting of $243,332.13 in disgorgement, $24,392.65 in interest, and a $40,000 civil penalty, and to be barred from the industry, with a right to apply for reentry after three years.

391,"On July 23, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Landon M. Smith of Salt Lake City, Utah, with operating a Ponzi scheme that raised approximately $2.1 million from fifty-one individual investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, Smith told investors that he was a real estate wholesaler who used investor funds for the earnest money to purchase and then quickly sell real property. The complaint alleges that Smith falsely represented to investors their funds were the only source of genuine money for their purchase of the properties, but instead used new investors' funds to pay returns to earlier investors, and to make it appear he entered into real-estate transactions. In reality, according to Smith, he never purchased the property, instead using new investor proceeds for personal expenses, including rent, utility payments, a trip to Hawaii to visit his children. He also allegedly created fake documents to create the false appearance of an actual transaction to give investors the illusion that their money was being used for legitimate business purposes, such as rent and utility bills and trips to Honolulu. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in federal district court in Utah and in coordination with the Utah Attorney General's Office and the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Smith consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the federal securities laws and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provision of Section 15(e) (a)(1), and from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and participating in any offering or sale of any security, investment, municipal securities, or other offering of securities.

To entice investors, Smith allegedly falsely told them that he was a real estate wholesaler who used investor funds for earnest money to purchase and then quickly resell properties.  Smith also allegedly promised investors returns of up to 100%.  The SEC's complaint alleges, however, that Smith never purchased the purported properties.  Instead, Smith allegedly used new investor funds to pay returns to earlier investors in a classic Ponzi scheme fashion and to pay his personal expenses, including his rent and trips to Hawaii.  To conceal his fraudulent scheme, Smith also created false real estate contracts with forged property owner's signatures.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, charges Smith with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

SEC Charges Two Minnesota Residents With Fraudulent Scheme to Manipulate the Company's Stock  On September 27, 2001, the Securities &amp; Exhange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against two Minnesota residents for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock of a publicly traded company. The Commission's complaint alleges that Michael JamesIVERS, a resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, was the sole owner and sole shareholder of the company, and that he and his wife, Christina, engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of over $1.5 million of stock in connection with the offering of securities. According to the complaint, James and Christina raised approximately $600,000 from investors by falsely claiming that their stock would be traded on the open market when in fact it was not trading at all. In fact, they were not and have never traded the same stock and had never sold a penny stock. James, who is the president and chief executive officer, has agreed to settle the charges against him. Without admitting or denying the allegations in James' Complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Minnesota on September 30, 2003, he consented to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. He also agreed not to violate the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"").

Hall in Alleged ""Marking the Close"" Market Manipulation  Scheme &nbsp; Thomas E. Hall Consents To  Permanent Injunction and $50,000 Civil Penalty &nbsp; U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. Consents  To Administrative Order Requiring Remedial  Undertakings and the Payment of a $100,000 Civil Penalty in Connection With Supervisory Failures   On October 31, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota against Thomas E. Hall (""Hall"") and Michael J. Rivers (""Rivers"") alleging that Hall and Rivers perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to artificially increase the closing price of First Federal Capital Corporation (""First Federal"") common stock.  Hall, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was employed as a registered representative and branch manager for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. (""Piper Jaffray"").  Rivers, of Winona, Minnesota, was a customer of Hall at Piper Jaffray.  The Commission's complaint alleges that the purpose of this scheme was to prevent or reduce numerous margin calls Rivers received on his trading accounts at Piper Jaffray.  The complaint also alleges that Hall and Rivers' scheme artificially increased the closing price of First Federal common stock, which constituted violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Hall consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of an order of permanent injunction enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposing a civil penalty of $50,000.  The litigation against Rivers is pending.  Separately, on November 5, 2002, the Commission entered an Order Instituting Proceedings Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (Order) against U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. (Piper Jaffray).  Piper Jaffray, while neither admitting nor denying the Order's findings, consented to the entry of the Order and the imposition of sanctions against it.   The Commission's Order found that from January 1998 through September 2001, Rivers and Hall engaged in a ""marking the close"" scheme.   The Commission's Order found that Rivers and Hall placed day-end trades at artificially higher prices in this stock thereby increasing improperly the stock's closing price so as to satisfy or reduce margin calls on his brokerage accounts at Piper Jaffray.  The Commission's Order found that Piper Jaffray failed to supervise Hall and failed to have adequate systems in place to detect or prevent this marking the close scheme.  Because of deficiencies with Piper Jaffray's surveillance procedures and with its structure for supervising ""producing"" branch managers, i.e., managers who also act as registered representatives for customers, the firm failed to detect and prevent Hall's misconduct. The Order found that there was one supervisor primarily responsible for the supervision of more than 70 ""producing"" branch managers.  In addition, Piper Jaffray did not provide this supervisor with information regarding the time the trades were executed and thus was unable to detect marking the close violations.  The Commission's Order also found that Piper Jaffray did not have an exception report capable of identifying end-of-the-day trades in its customer accounts; it instead relied on order ticket approval and/or review to detect possible marking the close violations.  The Order censures Piper Jaffray and requires it to maintain the following undertakings: creating a marking the close exception report, and the creation of at least eight District Sales Supervisors to replace the single position previously responsible for supervising ""producing"" branch managers.  The Order also requires Piper Jaffray to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.  The Commission would like to thank the National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, Inc.

Markov, Paul B Johnson, and Ilona V. Klausgaard, Civil Action No.: 06-CV-1479 (N.D. Texas)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, alleging violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that from October 2004 through April 2006, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent promotional campaign designed to inflate the price and trading volume of Sniffex stock.  According to the complaint:   From May 17, 2005, to give effect to a Rule 504 offering intended to boost the company's stock price, Johnson and two of his companies, Interim Capital Corporation (Interim), a Nevada corporation controlled by the Klausgaards, sold 15 million shares of common stock purportedly to two Nevada residents and three private Nevada companies.&nbsp; The press releases contained false claims that the device could detect explosives, or that Johnson was a mere figurehead who controlled virtually all of that company&rsquo;s public float and that he was the president and CEO of a private company he controlled. In fact, these false statements were fact-checked by two other individuals, who also used nominees to transfer approximately 3.75 million of their shares into the account of another company they controlled, in violation of Section 15(e) (the ""Rule 504"" offering).  In addition, as a result of this conduct, all defendants are charged with violating the registration provisions and the broker-dealer-registration provisions under Section 17(b)(a)(1). The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, an officer-and-director bar, penny stock bars, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and accountings against each defendant and against all but one of them, a permanent officer and director, permanently enjoining them from future violations and ordering them to pay a total of over $1.1 million to settle the charges.

Klausgaard, Civil Action No. 3:08 CV 11970 (N.D. Tex. July 15, 2008)  Securities and Exchange Commission  v. Mark B. Lindberg, Civil Action No. 08 CV 402 CVE SAJ (N.D. Okla. July 14, 2008)  SEC Files Two Market Manipulation Enforcement Actions With a Common Defendant  Cases Each Include a Settlement with Mark B. Lindberg; Sniffex Case Includes Other Defendants  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed two separate market manipulation enforcement cases: one filed today involving Homeland Safety International, Inc. (originally incorporated as Sniffex, Inc.), a Nevada corporation with a principal place of business in Irving, Texas (""Sniffex""), and the other filed yesterday involving three issuers &#8212; National Storm Management Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Glen Ellyn, Illinois (""NLST""); Deep Rock Oil and Gas, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma (""DPRK""); and Global Beverages Solutions (""GBVS""), a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The companies traded over the counter under the symbols SNFX (now HSFI), NLST, DPRK and GBVS, respectively. Mark B. Lindberg, 40, of Coppell, Texas, was charged in both cases and has settled them without admitting or denying the allegations in the two complaints. In the Sniffex complaint, the Commission also named Sniffex; its President Paul B. Johnson, 60, of Colleyville, Texas; Petar D. Mihaylov, 28, of Pazardjik, Bulgaria; Yuri P. Markov, 50, of Sofia, Bulgaria; Nicholas V. Klausgaard, 22 of Denmark; and Ilona V. Klausgaard, 49, of Denmark as defendants.  Allegations in the Sniffex Complaint  The Commission's complaint filed in the Northern District of Texas alleges that from October 2004 through April 2006, defendants Mihaylov and Markov acquired control of Sniffex &#8212; and carried out a $32 million pump-and-dump fraud scheme in concert with the other defendants. They acquired Sniffex in 2004 as a ""shell"" company from defendant Lindberg who agreed to provide them 15 million shares of so-called ""free-trading"" stock. To do this, Lindberg, Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson, Sniffex's President, participated in a sham SEC Rule 504 stock offering that ultimately resulted in scheme participants obtaining virtually all of the company's purportedly free-trading stock.  &nbsp; The complaint further alleges that Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson then engaged in a fraudulent promotional campaign intended to inflate the share price and trading volume in the public market for Sniffex stock. The campaign characterized Sniffex's primary product, a purported hand-held bomb detector invented by Markov, which was also called Sniffex, as a critical breakthrough in the global war against terrorism. At the behest of Mihaylov and Markov, Johnson drafted and issued 33 press releases on Sniffex's behalf. The press releases contained materially false information about tests regarding the product's ability to detect explosives and the company's financial situation. These fraudulent claims were parroted by Mihaylov in a spam-email campaign and in a glossy direct-mail piece.  According to the complaint, as a result of the fraudulent promotional campaign, Sniffex's share price increased from $0.80 to $6.00, giving the bogus company a market capitalization of $474 million at the scheme's peak. The individual defendants profited handsomely by disregarding re-sale restrictions and selling their scheme-derived shares into the artificially inflated market. Lindberg sold approximately 2.071 million shares for a net gain of approximately $315,481; Mihaylov sold approximately 3.73 million shares for approximately $11.3 million; Markov sold approximately 2.8 million shares for approximately $8.6 million; and the Klausgaards sold approximately 3.75 million shares for approximately $12.3 million. Neither the Sniffex press releases nor other public statements made in the scheme disclosed that Markov and Mihaylov controlled Sniffex, that they and the Klausgaards controlled virtually all of the company's public float, and that this group intended to sell, and was selling, millions of secretly owned shares into the market.  The Commission's complaint charges Sniffex, Lindberg, Mihaylov, Markov, and Johnson with violations of the securities-registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5, and charges the Klausgaards with violations of the securities-registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The Commission seeks the following relief from Mihaylov, Markov, Johnson, and the Klausgaards: permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil monetary penalties, penny-stock bars, and accountings. Lindberg, without admitting or denying any allegations in the complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar.  Allegations in the National Storm, Deep Rock, and Global Beverage Complaint  The Commission's complaint filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma alleges that defendant Lindberg and other members of a Shell Creation Group (""SCG"") manipulated at least three penny stocks from 2004 through 2006, including NLST, DPRK, and GBVS. Lindberg and the other members of the SCG, including attorneys, stock promoters, and financiers, worked together to acquire unrestricted shares of the three issuers and to profit by selling these shares into the market while manipulating the price of the stock by means of distributing promotional materials and coordinated trading. The SCG reaped profits in excess of $20 million from the sale of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock, and Lindberg personally reaped over $6.2 million in ill-gotten gains from this illegal conduct.  The complaint alleges that the SCG exploited the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina to manipulate the stock of NLST and DPRK. NLST purported to be a ""storm restoration firm specializing in residential home repair from the effects of wind and hail damage."" DPRK purported to be ""an oil and gas exploration and production company."" Lindberg and other members of the SCG assisted these companies reverse merge with SCG controlled shell companies. Throughout the reverse merger process, SCG members obtained control over large quantities of NLST and DPRK stock for its members and/or their nominees, which was issued without restriction based on legal opinion letters predicated on false information. In or about August and September 2005, the SCG began to orchestrate and pay for promotional campaigns, including faxes, spam emails, and glossy promotional pamphlets touting NLST and DPRK, claiming that Hurricane Katrina would result in greater profits and higher share prices for the companies. Some of the promotional materials encouraged readers to purchase the stock and included price targets. None of the NLST or DPRK promotional materials disclosed that the persons who ultimately orchestrated and paid for the promotional campaigns, the SCG, owned or controlled significant positions in the stocks and that they intended to sell stock while encouraging readers to purchase it. Additionally, the emails falsely indicated that NLST and DPRK made filings with the SEC.  The complaint further alleges that in the spring and summer of 2005, the SCG obtained control of a company that had elected business development status under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and had registered its securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The SCG renamed the company GBVS, and used it to acquire a company named Rudy Beverages. The SCG obtained control over large quantities of unrestricted shares of GBVS for its members and/or their nominees. Like NLST and DPRK, the SCG orchestrated and paid for promotional campaigns, including faxes, spam emails, and glossy promotional pamphlets touting GBVS. Some of the promotional materials encouraged readers to purchase the stock and included price targets. None of the GBVS promotional materials disclosed that the persons who ultimately orchestrated and paid for the promotional campaigns, the SCG, owned or controlled significant positions in the stock and that they intended to sell the stock while encouraging readers to purchase it.  According to the complaint, in some instances, accounts controlled by members of the SCG, including Lindberg, bought and sold NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock in an effort to increase the volume in the market and to increase the price shown for the stocks. This trading activity and other trading activities were sometimes coordinated on a daily basis. During the SCG's promotional campaigns for all of the issuers, the price and daily trading volume of the stocks increased significantly. Throughout the promotional campaigns, Lindberg and other members of the SCG engaged in heavy selling of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock for prices far below the value predictions asserted in the promotional materials. The SCG and Lindberg personally profited through their sales of NLST, DPRK, and GBVS stock into the manipulated market.  The complaint further alleges that the NLST and DPRK shares were sold by members of the SCG, including Lindberg, without being registered with the Commission and without a viable exemption from registration.  The Commission's complaint charges Lindberg with violations of the securities-registration provisions and the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Lindberg, without admitting or denying any allegations in the complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny-stock bar.

394,"On June 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former Equifax employee with insider trading in the securities of the company based on confidential information he learned about a massive data breach affecting millions of U.S. consumers.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on September 8, 2017, while working on a project for an unnamed potential client, Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, of Cumming, Georgia, purchased out-of-the-money put options for shares ofifax common stock with an expiration date of September 15, and a strike price of $130 per share. According to the complaint, after learning that the data had been exposed by a company employee, he immediately sold all of his options, realizing more than $75,000 in ill-gotten gains from his trading. The complaint further alleges Boninthu's trading violated the duty of trust and confidence he owed to his employer and the UIG's shareholders. Without admitting or denying the allegations, BonTHU has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, an officer-and-director bar, as well as a penalty of a total of nearly $1 million. In a parallel action, on March 12, 2019, United States District Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief. On June 27, 2020, UG's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) issued an investor alert cautioning investors to be aware of any suspicious activity or suspicious transactions that might be taking place in their brokerage accounts. Investors should be cautious of anyone trading based solely on non-public information, such as whether they are affiliated with a major company or a large technology company. For example, if an employee of an Atlanta-based software engineering firm misappropriates data from a customer, they may be targeted by an agency that is investigating whether it is appropriate to engage in such activity. As a result of this conduct, according to UGI's Complaint, by no later than August 31, at the close of trading on the market on Sept. 7, 2016, before the public disclosure of data that exposed the personal information of at least 143 million consumers to severe and immediate harm. This is the second case involving a","This past week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former Equifax manager with insider trading in advance of the companyâs September 2017 announcement of a massive data breach that exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of approximately 148 million U.S. customers. This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach. In March, the former chief information officer of Equifaxâs U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading.   In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.   According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach. The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options. Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.   Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the companyâs insider trading policy.  In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.  To settle the SECâs civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SECâs investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries. The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.

S. district court for Miami, Florida, charging Florida investment adviser Anthony James, age 47, with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

As in a classic Ponzi scheme, James transferred approximately $2.8 million from new clients to existing clients, to repay principal or to create the illusion of profitable trading. To facilitate and otherwise conceal their fraud, defendants provided clients with fraudulent account statements reflecting securities holdings and returns that did not exist. In fact, Defendants never invested any of their clients' money in any stock market.

397,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut-based software company GAW Miners, LLC and its principal, Homero Joshua Garza, with defrauding investors in a purported virtual currency mining scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, from approximately August 2014 through December 2014, the defendants used the lure of quick money from a twenty-first century payment system known as ""virtual currency"" to conduct a fraudulent scheme to generate millions of dollars in profits from mining profits. The complaint alleges that the scheme was simple at its core:   The defendants sold shares in the profits they claimed would be generated from using their purported computing power to ""minimize"" the amount of transactions in that currency.&nbsp;  In reality, they sold far more than they actually had in their computing centers, and the payouts for their sales were far larger than the promised returns from the mining operations.Â  The SEC alleges, for example, that defendants made many false and misleading statements to potential and actual investors about the use of the purported ""mining"" power, or the profitability and life-span of mining investments, in connection with their sale of stock in an unregistered securities offering. âMining"" is a form of digital currency that is distinct from "" fiat currency,"" and is used to pay for the processing, storage and maintenance costs of a currency, such as shipping, cooling and electricity. In order to achieve this, defendants must first acquire and retain a sufficient number of bitcoins in bitcoins to verify transactions and then sell the bitcoins into the public markets.The SEC further alleges the following: The Defendants sold to over 10,000 investors approximately $19 million in investment contracts representing shares of their profits, which were paid based on the success of those collective virtual currencies mining activities. They sold their bitcoins at prices in megabytes per second (megahash per minute), generating a return of about 10% per transaction. These bitcoins were then sold through a network of ""pools"" of trading pools, where investors could pool together to mine bitcoins. Investors could only direct their money to buy one bitcoin at a time and receive a share at the end of each trading pool, thereby earning a profit of approximately 10%. The first bitcoin purchased by customers was rewarded with a predetermined amount in bitcoin by the algorithm that performed the calculations that verified the transactions. Once the transaction was confirmed, investors' bitcoins could be transferred to their brokerage accounts and paid into a bank account.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two Bitcoin mining companies and their founder with conducting a Ponzi scheme that used the lure of quick riches from virtual currency to defraud investors.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Connecticut, ""mining"" for Bitcoin or other virtual currencies means applying computer power to try to solve complex equations that verify a group of transactions in that virtual currency.  The first computer or collection of computers to solve an equation is awarded new units of that virtual currency.  The SEC alleges that Homero Joshua Garza perpetrated the fraud through his Connecticut-based companies GAW Miners and ZenMiner by purporting to offer shares of a digital Bitcoin mining operation.  In reality, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining it promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed.  Returns paid to some investors came from proceeds generated from sales to other investors.  According to the SEC's complaint:   From August 2014 to December 2014, Garza and his companies sold $20 million worth of purported shares in a digital mining contract they called a Hashlet.&nbsp;  More than 10,000 investors purchased Hashlets, which were touted as always profitable and never obsolete.&nbsp;  Although Hashlets were depicted in GAW Miners' marketing materials as a physical product or piece of mining hardware, the promised contract purportedly entitled the investor to control a share of computing power that GAW Miners claimed to own and operate.&nbsp;  Investors were misled to believe they would share in returns earned by the Bitcoin mining activities when in reality GAW Miners directed little or no computing power toward any mining activity.&nbsp;  Because Garza and his companies sold far more computing power than they owned, they owed investors a daily return that was larger than any actual return they were making on their limited mining operations.&nbsp;  Therefore, investors were simply paid back gradually over time under the mantra of ""returns"" out of funds that Garza and his companies collected from other investors.&nbsp;  Most Hashlet investors never recovered the full amount of their investments, and few made a profit.   The SEC's complaint charges Garza, GAW Miners, and ZenMiner with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); GAW Miners and Garza with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and ZenMiner with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.

Stephen Luscko, Gregory Neu, and Justin Medlin, et al., United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action No CV 07-7831 (AGRX)   The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a civil injunctive action against four defendants for their roles in a fraudulent ""pump and dump"" market manipulation scheme. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the defendants orchestrated a scheme to manipulate the stock of four microcap companies: eDollars, Emerging Holdings, Massclick, Inc., and China Score, all of which were based out of Long Beach, California.  According to the Commission, the scheme began in March 2004, when the company's stock price and volume were artificially inflated by spam e-mails sent to investors from a townhouse owned by the parents of the companies' president and secretary and treasurer. As a result of this manipulative scheme, defendants NeU and Lampcko sold their stock, or directed their trading nominees to sell their shares, for a total of over $6.5 million in trading profits. In a parallel action, on July 28, 2004 the U. S. Attorney's Office for Southern California filed criminal charges against the three defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5 (c), and 17(d) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 15(e) the Securities Exchange Act and Rules 15e-1 and 16a-3 thereon.

SEC Charges Three in Pump and Dump Price Manipulation Scheme Involving Spam E-Mails Touting Penny Stocks    The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") on Friday, April 27, 2007, filed civil securities fraud charges against three individuals and three penny stock issuers for engaging in a ""pump and dump"" market manipulation scheme involving spam emails that netted the defendants $6.5 million.  Named as defendants were Stephen Luscko, age 39, of Sarasota, Florida; Gregory Neu, age 30 of Miami, Florida; and Justin Medlin, age 24, last known to be of San Diego, California. The three penny stock issuers named in the complaint were Emerging Holdings, Inc., Massclick, Inc., and China Score, Inc. The complaint also named Lyons Checkshop, Inc., Tyson Su, and Marc Primo Pulisci as relief defendants based on their receipt of proceeds from the fraudulent scheme.  The Commission's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that, between March and August 2004, the defendants artificially inflated the stock price and trading volume of certain companies whose stock traded on the over-the-counter market. The complaint alleges that defendants Luscko and Neu formed four companies, including defendants Emerging Holdings, Massclick and China Score, as well as another entity that is now defunct, and then recruited friends and business associates to act as company officers. According to the complaint, Luscko and Neu arranged for these companies to transfer millions of shares of stock to their own or their friends' brokerage accounts in a series of sham transactions designed to bypass Commission regulations that required the shares to be restricted from being resold into the open market. The complaint also alleges that Luscko and Neu drafted false and misleading spam e-mails that were edited by defendant Medlin. Further, the complaint alleges that Medlin embarked on a weekend spam e-mail campaign, bombarding the investing public with millions of spam e-mails that generated significant investor interest and resulted in rapid increases in the companies' stock price and volume. The Commission further alleges that, having ""pumped"" up the companies' stock prices, Luscko and Neu then, directly or through their friends, ""dumped"" their shares into the open market, and the companies' stock prices declined rapidly thereafter. As a result of trades made in these four stocks, Luscko, Neu, and Medlin netted $6.5 million.  In a related criminal action, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia filed charges against Luscko and Neu, who both pled guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud and e-mail fraud. Neu was sentenced to five years imprisonment and three years supervised release. Luscko was sentenced to five years imprisonment and two years supervised release. The criminal authorities have seized more than $3,000,000 from bank accounts associated with Luscko and Neu.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Luscko, Neu, Emerging Holdings, Massclick, and China Score violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also alleges that Luscko, Neu, and Medlin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Medlin violated the anti-touting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the individual defendants, as well as a penny stock bar against Luscko, Neu, and Medlin, and injunctions prohibiting Luscko and Neu from conducting unregistered securities offerings. The Commission also seeks disgorgement of the proceeds from the improper stock sales currently held by relief defendants Lyons Checkshop, Su, and Pulisci.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of New Mexican, Thomas H. Laws, of Silver City, N.M., received over $1.1 million in investor funds to purchase a silver mine and to make a down payment on a mining claim. The complaint alleges that Laws provided Mueller with numerous, inconsistent explanations about the location of the funds, including that the money had been sent to an attorney's trust fund for escrow and that he had no knowledge the $500,000 was being held in the account. As a result of Laws' theft, SantaFe's annual report on its 2017 fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was materially false. In a parallel action, on October 1, 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order against Laws and ordered him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as from aiding and abetting violations by Laws of Section 13(c) in violation of those provisions, and from violating the antifraud provisions of both the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Laws consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company and a civil penalty of $250, which is equal to his disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Mueller also agreed to be barred from serving as a director or officer of a publicly-traded company for a period of five years.The SEC previously charged Laws with fraud in connection with his fraudulent use of investor money for various corporate purposes, such as the purchase of mining claims and mining equipment. He was subsequently ordered to pay a $25,500 penalty and be suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission for one year and one month.In its action filed on September 24,Â 20, the SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of Mueller and the company.

The SEC's complaint alleges that Mueller, at the time of Laws' misconduct, became aware of numerous red flags showing that the investor funds were missing.  In particular, the complaint alleges that Laws provided Mueller with inconsistent explanations about $500,000 that had purportedly been escrowed for the purchase of a silver mine.  The complaint further alleges that Mueller nevertheless signed the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017, and the corresponding management representation letter that Santa Fe Gold provided to its independent auditor, both of which falsely represented that $500,000 had been escrowed towards the purchase of a mine.

Jeffrey L. Mowen et al., Civil Action No. 2:09CV0786 (D. Utah., filed September 2, 2009)  SEC Charges Eight Individuals with Participating in $41 Million Offering Fraud Based in Utah and Colorado  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced yesterday that it filed charges against eight individuals who participated in the operation of a multi-million dollar offering fraud based in Utah and Colorado.  The Commission's civil injunctive complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah on September 2, 2009, alleges that between January 2007 and July 2008, Thomas R. Fry and Fry's promoters, Bevan J. Wilde, Gary W. Hansen, Michael G. Butcher, James B. Mooring, David G. Bartholomew, and Michael W. Averett (collectively, the ""Promoters""), raised approximately $41 million from the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states, over half of which was lost to investors. According to the complaint, around $18 million of the funds raised by Fry and the Promoters was funneled by Fry into a Ponzi scheme run by Jeffrey L. Mowen, a convicted felon and securities law recidivist, who misappropriated over $8 million of these funds. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters knowingly or recklessly distributed private placement memoranda to investors that misrepresented the level of their due diligence and falsely stated that all the funds were being used to make collateralized domestic real estate loans and domestic small business loans. The complaint further alleges that, Fry, who dealt directly with Mowen, committed fraud by failing to disclose Mowen's involvement and criminal history to the Promoters and investors. According to the complaint, Fry and the Promoters also committed registration violations with respect to the securities offerings and their status as brokers.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, the defendants violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate Sections 5(a) and 5(c) the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. As part of this action, the Commission seeks against each of the defendants an injunction against future violations of the provisions set forth above, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and third tier civil money penalties. The Commission has also provided assistance to the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Utah, which has filed criminal charges against Mowen relating to the Ponzi scheme.

Zhichen Zhou and Yannan Liu, Civil Action Number 07-CV-1515-CIV (SDNY)  SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Charges Against Chinese Resident and His cousin   The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission announced today that it filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging a Chinese citizen and his cousin with insider trading. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, between October 2015 and February 2014, Zhou made highly suspicious purchases of MedAssets, Inc., a healthcare performance improvement company, and Chindex International Inc. (""Chindex""), a microcap healthcare company headquartered in China, ahead of public announcements that the companies would be acquired by certain private equity firms.  According to the Complaint, the bulk of these purchases were funded by a wire transfer from a cousin who worked at TPG Capital, a London-based specialist investment manager, who also worked on the acquisitions. Zhou sold all 38,479 shares of the company and realized profits of $299,425.21, which represents more than four times his stated net worth. On February 25, 2016, when the acquisition announcement was made public and the stock closed at $30.85, up $7.32, or 30.91 percent, from Friday's close. In the case of both acquisitions, however, one of those bidders was a large Chinese company with $74.3 billion under management, whose stock was listed on NASDAQ and which traded at a premium of approximately $19.35 per share on Friday, February 18, 2014. After the announcement on February 24, 2020, Liu and Xiaobo, both of China's largest online financial services firm, sold their entire position and made over $300,000 in illicit profits through the purchases. Liu is Liu's cousin and served as the President of Fuscent, another Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform that is based in Beijing, China. He is also the founder and CEO of Yooli.com, an online shopping platform for which Liu serves as a vice president. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Xia has consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges and an emergency asset freeze based on trading in advance of the acquisition of two healthcare companies, MedAssets, Inc. and Chindex International Inc.  The SEC alleges that Zhichen Zhou used funds provided by his cousin, Yannan Liu, to trade illegally, resulting in profits of approximately $300,000.  The SEC further alleges that Liu, who was formerly employed by a private equity firm that was a bidder in both the MedAssets and Chindex International acquisitions, provided the non-public information about the acquisitions to Zhou.  The announcement of the MedAssets acquisition, which occurred last week on November 2, 2015, caused the stock to rise more than 30%.  Similarly, Chindex International's stock rose more than 13% on February 17, 2014, the date of the announcement.  According to the SEC's complaint, Zhou, a resident of Beijing, China, used a newly opened brokerage account to purchase almost 40,000 shares of MedAssets at a cost of nearly $900,000.  Liu, a resident of Hong Kong, provided the bulk of the funds used to purchase the stock.  The nearly $900,000 in purchases of MedAssets represented more than four times Zhou's stated net worth.  The SEC also alleges that Zhou illegally profited from trades in Chindex International based on information provided by Liu.  In that instance, Zhou purchased more than 3000 shares leading up to the acquisition announcement and reaped profits of approximately $7,500.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze against monies held in Zhou's United States brokerage accounts, and issued an order to show cause why an injunction and other miscellaneous relief should not issue.  A hearing has been scheduled for November 24, 2015.  The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme designed to conceal from their institutional customers the manner in which Knight was working their orders. In doing so, they failed to provide best execution to their customers resulting in profits for Knight, which they personally, exceeded the industry norm.&nbsp;  The complaint also alleges the following:   In 1999 and 2000, Knight sold approximately 100,000 shares of Nasdaq securities to institutional investors who wanted to purchase or sell securities at prices that were substantially higher than the price Knight paid for those shares, thereby causing Knight to lose millions of dollars in compensation to its institutional customer, as a result of improper use of trade modifiers that obscured the execution quality that Knight customers were receiving from Knight. Knight also improperly employed Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (ACT), which obscured, among other things, that customer's compensation for trades was based on the cost of acquiring (or selling) shares pursuant to the orders, plus a reasonable amount of compensation. These fraudulent practices included material omissions and misrepresentations about the quality of order execution at Knight and were inconsistent with the duties Knight had performed on its customers and the duty Knight owed to them to maintain and maintain the integrity of its books and records, including the confidentiality of customer records. As a control person, he is liable to disgorge his or her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 19329 / August 8, 2005  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. KENNETH D. PASTERNAK AND JOHN P. LEIGHTON, No. 05-3905 (JAP) (D.N.J.)    SEC FILES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST KNIGHT SECURITIES' FORMER CEO AND INSTITUTIONAL SALES DESK MANAGER   The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil fraud action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Kenneth D. Pasternak (""Pasternak""), the former Chief Executive Officer and Head of the Trading Desk of Knight Securities, L.P., now known as Knight Equity Markets, L.P. (""Knight"" or ""Firm""), and John P. Leighton (""John Leighton""), the former head of the Institutional Sales Desk at Knight, for their role in the ""best execution"" scheme that defrauded Knight's institutional customers. The Commission's complaint alleges in part, that:    The defendants among others at Knight engaged in a fraudulent scheme designed to conceal from their institutional customers the manner in which they were working their orders.  In doing so, the defendants failed to provide best execution to their customers resulting in profits for Knight, and the defendants personally, that far exceeded the industry norm.  &nbsp; John Leighton and Kenneth Pasternak, as senior executives at Knight, reviewed Knight reports and data which disclosed, among other things, the manner in which Knight was working institutional customer orders and the extraordinary profits that Knight was generating from these institutional orders.  John Leighton and Pasternak therefore knew or were reckless in not knowing that customers were being fraudulently deprived of best execution, but permitted Knight's traders, including John Leighton's brother Joseph Leighton, to continue the unlawful trading practices while both John Leighton and Pasternak were receiving millions of dollars in compensation directly generated from the lucrative trading.  At the same time that Pasternak and John Leighton knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Knight was fraudulently depriving its customers of ""best execution"", Pasternak made material misstatements in Knight's Commission filings, including Knight's Form 10-K, and John Leighton made statements to Knight's institutional customers all concerning Knight's execution quality.&nbsp; John Leighton and Pasternak were responsible for supervising Knight's institutional sales traders.  By reviewing institutional trade and exception reports, John Leighton and Pasternak knew or were reckless in not knowing that the sales traders systematically misused Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (""ACT"") trade modifiers, causing the untimely reporting of trades to the ACT.  The trade modifier misuse enabled the sales traders to record inaccurate execution times on the Firm's books and records, compromised the ability of the customers to determine the quality of the executions they were receiving, and allowed certain Knight employees to circumvent limit order protection protocols at the Firm.  Despite the systematic misuse of the ACT modifiers, John Leighton and Pasternak did not take effective remedial action, and the sales traders continued to misuse the trade modifiers until November 2002.&nbsp;  The Commission alleges in its complaint that Pasternak and John Leighton violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also alleges that Pasternak and John Leighton aided and abetted Knight's violations of Sections 15(c)(1), 10(b) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 17a-3 thereunder.  The Commission also alleges that Pasternak is liable as a control person, under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, for Knight's violations of Sections 15(c)(1) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  In its action, the Commission is seeking against each defendant a permanent injunction, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and civil penalties. In December 2004, the Commission and the NASD brought settled enforcement actions against Knight.  The enforcement actions resulted in payments of over $79 million in disgorgement, civil penalties and fines.  In Knight's settlement with the Commission, the firm consented to the issuance of an administrative order, without admitting or denying the findings therein, that found that Knight (i) willfully violated the broker-dealer antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act  (Section 15(c)(1)(A)) and multiple provisions of the books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rules 17a-3(a)(1), 17a-3(a)(7), 17a-4(b)(1) and 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder), and (ii) failed reasonably to supervise pursuant to Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act with a view to preventing violations of Sections 15(c)(1) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3(a)(1) thereunder.  For further information, see In the Matter of Knight Securities, L.P., Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rel. No. 50867 (December 16, 2004). Additionally, in April 2005, the Commission and the NASD brought and settled enforcement actions against Joseph Leighton.  In that settlement, Joseph Leighton, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment that (i) permanently enjoined him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and (ii) ordered him to pay $1,939,264 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, $660,282.78 in prejudgment interest and $750,000 in civil penalties. Joseph Leighton also consented, without admitting or denying the findings, to the entry of a Commission Order that permanently barred him from association with any broker or dealer pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act.

The Commission Charges Former Wall Street Access Broker with Late Trading and Deceptive Market Timing of Mutual Funds    The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it filed an enforcement action in the United States District Court against Gene T. Mancinelli, a former broker at Wall Street Access, a registered broker-dealer. In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Mancinelli permitted his hedge fund customers to late trade and deceptively market time mutual funds. Specifically, from April 2001 through October 2001, Mancinelli accepted and executed more than 2,000 late trades in mutual funds for one hedge fund customer. Mancinelli permitted this customer routinely to place orders to purchase, redeem or exchange mutual fund shares well after 4:00 p.m. ET, the time as of which funds calculate their net asset value (NAV). Mancinelli was aware that the late trades would receive that day's NAV as opposed to the next trading day's NAV. Additionally, Mancinelli utilized deceptive tactics, such as using multiple accounts and multiple broker numbers, to hide the identity of his market timing customers from mutual funds, and otherwise to facilitate his customers' market timing strategies.

Mitchell, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. C 02-05613 RS  SEC Charges Current Director of and Former Officers of First Virtual Communications, Inc. with Overstating Revenues and Earnings  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the filing of a complaint on November 26, 2002, against three former senior executives (including the founder and current Chairman of the Board) of First Virtual Communications, Inc. (&quot;FVC&quot;) for causing FVC to announce overstated revenues and earnings and then selling FVC shares before issuance of the correct financial information.  The former executives charged today are:  FVC's current Chairman of the Board and former President and CEO, Ralph K. Ungermann; its former CFO, James O. Mitchell; and its former Vice President of Sales, Alan J. McMillan.  Ungermann, Mitchell, and McMillan settled the Commission's action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  They agreed to repay a total of about $1.3 million in illegal trading profits, interest, and civil money penalties.  Since 1993, FVC, a Silicon Valley technology company, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, has engineered and manufactured video-conferencing products and, through independent distributors, marketed and sold these products to the ultimate customer.  FVC's common stock traded on Nasdaq's National Market from April 1998 through August 8, 2002, when it started trading on Nasdaq's small cap market.    The Commission's complaint, filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Ungermann, Mitchell, and McMillan caused FVC to announce overstated revenues and earnings figures in a January 28, 1999 press release.  The complaint alleges that, in order to meet revenue goals for the fourth quarter and year end 1998, FVC entered into an agreement with its largest distributor in which the distributor agreed to buy $3 million of FVC product in exchange for FVC's agreement to grant the distributor various return rights on the $3 million of FVC product and on product FVC had previously sold to the distributor.    FVC improperly recognized as revenue approximately $5.9 million in sales that were subject to the return rights, in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendants' actions, in its January 28, 1999 earnings release, FVC overstated its fourth quarter revenue by 114% and annual revenue by 16% and announced annual earnings of $1.1 million instead of a loss of $2 million.  The complaint also alleges that Ungermann, Mitchell, and McMillan failed to disclose this agreement to FVC's auditors, even when specifically asked.  The complaint further alleges that, in February 1999, after the earnings release, the defendants sold a total of 330,000 shares of FVC stock, reaping illegal trading profits.  In April 1999, after the auditors learned of the return rights that FVC had granted, FVC filed an annual report on Form 10-K that correctly reported FVC's fourth quarter and annual revenue and earnings.  After the announcement of FVC's correct financial results, FVC's stock price dropped 60%.  The defendants are:   Ralph K. Ungermann, age 60, of Los Altos Hills, California.  Ungermann founded FVC in 1993.  He was FVC's CEO and President when FVC made the agreement with the distributor.  He currently is FVC's Chairman of the Board.  The complaint alleges that Ungermann caused FVC's overstatement of revenues and earnings figures in the January 28, 1999 press release, did not disclose the return agreement to FVC's auditors, and participated in FVC's falsification of books and records.   The complaint further alleges that Ungermann sold 200,000 FVC shares, realizing illegal trading profits of $384,192 from the announcement of the false revenue and earnings.  Ungermann simultaneously settled the SEC's action without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Ungermann agreed to the entry of a court order enjoining him from committing future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay $384,192 in disgorgement (representing ill-gotten gains from his trades), $71,575 in prejudgment interest, and $384,192 as a civil money penalty.&nbsp;  James O.

SEC CHARGES TWO FORMER MINNESOTA-BASED FINANCIAL PRINCIPALS WITH FRAUDULENT FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING SCHEME  On September 29, the SecuritiesandExchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action charging two Minnesota residents and their companies with securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis, alleges that from at least July 2006 through July 2009, two individuals, Trevor Cook (a 37-year-old resident of Burnsville, Minnesota), and two shell companies they controlled, raised more than $190 million from over 1,000 investors by selling investments in a purported foreign currency trading venture. According to the Commission, Cook and his companies, which were not registered at the time, used investor money to pay personal expenses, invest in offshore trading firms, finance the construction of a casino in Panama, and for other illegal purposes. The complaint also charges Cook's companies and entities with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or any other findings, all defendants have consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) or aiding and abetting any future violation of these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, imposing civil penalties and imposing penny stock bars against each of them. In addition, each defendant has agreed to be enjoined from participating in any offering or sale of any security, with the right to reapply for a period to determine the amount of disgorgement and civil monetary relief that will be deemed appropriate for each investor under the relevant federal law.

Minn., filed November 23, 2009)  On November 23, 2009, the Honorable Michael J. Davis of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota issued an Asset Freeze Order against all assets of Trevor G. Cook (Cook), Patrick J. Kiley (Kiley), both Minnesota residents, and UBS Diversified Growth LLC, Universal Brokerage FX Management LLC, Oxford Global Advisors LLC, and Oxford Global Partners LLC (the Defendant Companies), four shell companies owned or controlled by them. The court also issued an asset freeze order against several Relief Defendant Companies: Basel Group LLC, Crown Forex LLC, Market Shot LLC, PFG Coin and Bullion, Oxford FX Growth L.P., Oxford Global FX LLC, Oxford Global Managed Futures Fund L.P, UBS Diversified FX Advisors LLC, UBS Diversified FX Growth L.P., and UBS Diversified FX Management LLC. The court also entered a freeze order against certain assets of relief defendants Clifford and Ellen Berg, who received investor funds from Cook. In addition, Judge Davis issued an order appointing a receiver over all of these assets. The court issued the freeze and receivership orders under seal while the assets were being secured, and the seal has now been lifted.  The SEC alleges that from at least July 2006 through at least July 2009, Cook and Kiley, through the Defendant Companies, raised at least $190 million from at least 1,000 investors through the sale of unregistered investments in a purported foreign currency trading venture by misrepresenting that they would deposit each investor's funds into a separate account in the investor's name to trade in foreign currencies and generate annual returns of 10 percent to 12 percent. They also misrepresented that their foreign currency trading program involved little or no risk and that investors' principal would be safe and could be withdrawn at any time. The SEC alleges that Cook and Kiley did not place each investor's money into a segregated account in the name of the investor. Instead, they pooled the investors' funds in bank and trading accounts in the names of entities that they controlled, including the Defendant and Relief Defendant companies. The SEC alleges that Cook and Kiley misappropriated $42.8 million of investors' money, including $18 million that Cook used to buy ownership interests in two trading firms; $12.8 million that Cook and Kiley transferred to Panama to purportedly finance the construction of a casino; $2.8 million that Cook used to acquire the Van Dusen Mansion and $4.8 million that Cook lost through gambling. Cook and Kiley also misspent approximately $51 million to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors. The SEC further alleges that Cook and Kiley placed $108 million of investors' funds into banking and trading accounts in the names of their various shell companies and used some of this money to trade foreign currencies, resulting in losses of at least $48 million.  The SEC's complaint charges Cook, Kiley, and the Defendant Companies with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief already obtained, the complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions and disgorgement from all defendants as well as financial penalties from Cook and Kiley, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from the relief defendants. A hearing on the SEC's motion for preliminary injunction has been set for December 4, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. at 300 South Fourth Street, 202 U.S. Courthouse, Minneapolis, MN.

""J. C."" ""Willy"" willy. The Commission's complaint alleges that, beginning in 1999, the defendant raised more than $4.5 million from investors by offering interests in a purported ""High Yield Investment Program"" paying guaranteed profits of 100% per month. In fact, no such program existed, and the investor monies were wired to the bank account of Temperance Investments, Ltd. (""Temperance"") in Gibraltar.  According to its complaint, in June of 1999 and continuing to raise investor funds for various purposes, John ""Willy"" was introduced to Kim Barrus (""Barrus"") and Rudy Chacon (""Chacon""). The complaint further alleges, on or about August 2, 1999 the defendants wired $1.23 million to Superior, Inc., a Bahamian corporation, for investment in an overseas trading program, which would earn profits in excess of 10 percent per trading day. As a result of the trading, Superior's investment was valued at $2.4 million, $200,000 of which was wired from the same bond account to a separate account at a Nevada corporation controlled by the Defendants. On November 19, 2000 and April 1, 2003, defendants entered into a written agreement with Superior whereby it agreed to provide a $3 million investment from which it would receive a 10% to 15% return per trade. This final wire brought the total investment to $5.6 million. After the initial investment by Superior and Amberhill was placed on a joint venture basis with the Bahamas-based Bahamas Bank, it was claimed that all of these investments would be invested in such a way as to generate profits as high as 100%.

Willy, Jr., a Southern California resident, alleging that he violated the federal securities registration and antifraud provisions.  Willy promoted an overseas &quot;high-yield&quot; investment program that raised more than $4.5 million from investors.  The investment program purportedly provided guaranteed profits of 100 percent per month.  In reality, the investment program did not exist and Willy used investor money to pay for his personal expenses.  The Complaint alleges that Willy, purportedly acting on behalf of Temperance Investments Ltd., a Gibraltar company, entered into agreements with two investor groups whereby Temperance would provide investors with access to a purported investment program in which short-term bank-debt instruments could be purchased at a discount and quickly sold at a profit.  Willy told the investor groups that their monies would never be placed at risk.  Instead, investor monies would remain in separate bank accounts and would generate lines of credit that Temperance would use in the program.  In fact, investor monies were commingled and transferred from their account in Gibraltar to any one of several accounts in Europe and the United States that were controlled by Willy.  The lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Eastern Division, in Riverside, California, alleges that Willy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, it alleges that Willy violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

In addition, as alleged, while in possession of material non-public information about the stock promotion, Balleaux engaged in a fraudulent scheme in which he solicited investors to purchase shares of his company, Spot Marketing LLC, for his own personal use.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least the second half of 1997, Boyd caused Paragon to overstate its revenues and gross margin recognition by overstating its construction costs by about 85% and by improperly recording over $14 million of previously-recorded project losses, lowering project profitability on certain projects, and recording an additional charge against earnings of $1.7 million as an allowance against deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1997. According to the complaint, the scheme resulted in the overstatement of the Company's financial results for 1997 and 1998 by more than $25 million and overstated its net income by approximately $2.4 million. In addition, as a result of Boyd's scheme to artificially inflate the company's reported revenues, it caused it to report a loss in connection with several of its golf course construction contracts, which resulted from the improper accounting practices described below.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Henry Sargent, a Connecticut resident, created BMP Holdings Inc. and issued BMP shares to friends, family, and co-workers for the purpose of manufacturing shares to be sold later on public markets.  To register the public sale of these shares, attorney Joseph Tomasek, a New Jersey resident, allegedly helped Sargent file BMP's Form S-1, which falsely stated that BMP shareholders had acquired their shares for investment purposes and that Sargent did not control the shares.  New York residents Patrick Giordano, Frederick Mintz, and Alan Fraade then helped Sargent and Tomasek facilitate the merger of BMP into PixarBio Corporation, a private company that the SEC previously charged along with three other individuals.  The defendants allegedly transferred the fraudulently registered BMP shares to Sargent, Giordano, and M. Jay Herod, a defendant in the PixarBio litigation.  Sargent and Giordano allegedly made over $1 million from the sale of BMP to PixarBio, and the sale of the fraudulently registered shares into the public market.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Sargent, Tomasek, Giordano, Mintz, and Fraade with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint further charges Tomasek with aiding and abetting Sargent's violations of the antifraud provisions, and Giordano with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions by Mintz and Fraade.

Daniel Spitzer, et al., United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Civil Action No.: 10-CV-1786 (N.D. Ill.)  SEC CHARGES INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH RUNNING $105 MILLION PONZI SCHEME  The Securities &amp; Commission announced today that it filed an emergency civil action in the U. S. District court in Chicago, Illinois to halt an ongoing Ponzi scheme involving more than 400 investors.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least 2004 through the present, Daniel ""Spitzer"" has been running a fraudulent scheme in which he has raised over $100 million from investors through a series of false and misleading statements and omissions about the investments, including that the funds had never lost money and had profitable historical returns. The complaint also alleges that, as part of the scheme, the defendants regularly transferred and commingled investor funds in an elaborate web of domestic and offshore entity accounts, which provided investors with inflated returns leading them to believe their investments were profitable. In reality, however, according to these false statements, spitzer used $71,886,926 of investor proceeds to pay $15,208,038 in purported operating expenses, and $4,819,024 in third party business expenses. To cover up his scheme and in furtherance of it, SPitzer issued to his investors false periodic statements that gave investors the false impression that they were investing in foreign currencies, when, in fact, their money was losing money. He also used investors' money for personal expenses including payments to himself and other sales agents. Finally, to conceal his fraud, Spitz allegedly transferred millions of dollars in investor money to a bank account at the National Bank of Anguilla and to Kenzie Financial Management, Inc. (Kenzie Financial), a Nevada limited liability company that purportedly acted as an administrative manager for these six funds. As a result of his conduct, defendants have been enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4) of The Investment Advisers Act and Section 204(4)-8 of Regulation","-->            Home &#160;&gt;&#160; Litigation &#160;&gt;&#160; Litigation Releases &#160;&gt;&#160; 2010    2010  -->  -->            U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONLitigation Release No. 21579 / June 28, 2010SEC v. Daniel Spitzer et al., Civil Action No. 10 C 3758 (N.D. Ill.) (Leinenweber, J.)The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an emergency asset freeze against a purported fund manager based in the Virgin Islands who perpetrated a $105 million Ponzi scheme against investors.The SEC alleges that Daniel Spitzer, a resident of St. Thomas, used several entities and sales agents to misrepresent to investors that their money would be invested in investment funds that, in turn, would be invested primarily in foreign currency. Investors were falsely told that Spitzer's funds had never lost money and historically produced profitable annual returns that one year reached over 180 percent. Spitzer instead used money raised from new investors to pay earlier investors, and misappropriated investor funds to pay unrelated business expenses. He concealed his scheme by issuing phony documents to investors that led them to believe their investments were profiting.The SEC has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Spitzer and his companies.According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Spitzer conducted his fraudulent scheme, which involved 400 investors, from at least 2004 to present. He only invested approximately $30 million of the more than $105 million he raised from investors. Of that amount, Spitzer used approximately $13.5 million to invest through an offshore entity via a bank account in the Netherlands Antilles. These investments, some of which were placed in a French financial institution, lost money and were subsequently liquidated. Spitzer used another $16 million to invest in money market funds that earned only a few thousand dollars. Spitzer liquidated these investments as well. After the investments were liquidated, the money was returned to Spitzer, and he used it to repay investors in Ponzi-like fashion. To cover up his scheme, Spitzer issued to his investors false Schedule K-1s that showed inflated returns and led them to believe that their investments were profitable.The SEC's complaint alleges that Spitzer used offshore bank accounts to pay purported business expenses of his companies. Spitzer deposited investor funds into bank accounts at the National Bank of Anguilla and the First Bank of Puerto Rico, from which he paid more than $15 million in purported operating expenses and payments to himself and various sales agents. Spitzer also used more than $4.8 million to pay third-party business expenses. The SEC further alleges that Spitzer led an extravagant lifestyle and spent more than $900,000 at a Las Vegas casino.According to the SEC's complaint, Spitzer's scheme is on the verge of collapse as he has attempted to delay and avoid paying investor redemptions. As recently as March 2010, Spitzer obtained $100,000 from an investor for an investment in one of his purportedly more conservative investment funds. Rather than invest the money, Spitzer used a portion of the money in April 2010 to pay other investors and third-party expenses.At the SEC's request for emergency relief for investors, the Hon. Harry D. Leinenweber of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an order freezing all assets of Spitzer and his companies. Among other things, the court order requires that the defendants repatriate to the U.S. all assets located overseas.The SEC's complaint charges Spitzer and the defendant entities with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Spitzer and two of the asset management companies with violations of Section 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint also seeks a court order of permanent injunction against Spitzer and each of the defendant entities, as well as an order of disgorgement including prejudgment interest. The complaint also seeks financial penalties against Spitzer and five of the asset management companies.The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Irish Financial Regulator, Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, AutoritÃ© des marches financier in France, the Ontario Securities Commission and the Financial Intelligence and Investigations Unit Attached to the Royal Anguilla Police Force in Anguilla.The SEC's investigation is continuing.

Stuart W. Fuhlendorf, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle Division)  SEC Charges Former CFO of Isilon Systems, Inc. With Fraudulent Accounting Scheme  On September 28, 2006, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Seattle, Seattle Division, charging the former chief financial officer of a Seattle-based data storage device company with fraudulently inflating the company's revenues in the first three quarters of 2007. The Commission's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2006 and continuing through the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year, Stuart ""Stuart W."" Fufendorff of Seattle engaged in a fraudulent accounting scheme in which he improperly recognized revenue on five transactions that were in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") and the Company's own internal accounting policies (""Exchange Act"").  The complaint further alleges, as the fraud was occurring, that the complaint was filed in response to pressure from the market to perform, and concealed the accounting fraud by the companies' Audit Committee, outside auditor and Controller. According to the complaints, in order to maintain the stock price above $23 per share, FNFRL was required to report revenue that was materially inflated by a total of $4.8 million over the third quarter and fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, fuhlrf has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest and a penalty.

Wash. filed Sept. 14, 2009)  SEC CHARGES FORMER ISILON SYSTEMS CFO WITH FRAUDULENTLY BOOSTING REVENUE  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against Stuart W. Fuhlendorf, former Chief Financial Officer of Isilon Systems, Inc. On the heels of the Seattle-based electronic storage company's successful initial public offering (IPO), Fuhlendorf allegedly cut secret side deals with Isilon customers to allow the company to report inflated sales to its shareholders.  The SEC alleges Fuhlendorf concealed the true deal terms from Isilon's controller, audit committee, and outside auditor, leading the company to report $4.8 million in improper revenue during 2006 and 2007. In a separate proceeding, the SEC also filed settled charges against Isilon for its misleading financial information.  According to the SEC's complaints, filed in federal district court in Seattle, Isilon became a publicly-traded company in December 2006 and its stock price increased 77 percent on its opening day. The high expectations created by the successful IPO placed significant pressure on Isilon's management to meet analysts' lofty revenue forecasts. When anticipated deals failed to materialize, the SEC alleges that Fuhlendorf personally negotiated deal terms so that Isilon could get product out the door, even though the secret deal terms made revenue recognition improper under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the company's own internal policies.  The SEC's complaints allege that Isilon improperly booked revenue on five transactions, including three transactions with oral side agreements between Fuhlendorf and representatives of Isilon customers; a sale in which the terms were not fixed and determinable until after Isilon's quarter ended; and a roundtrip transaction that was essentially a circular flow of cash from Isilon to the customer and back to Isilon. The SEC alleges that Fuhlendorf lied to Isilon's audit committee about the true nature of the deal, which was merely a sham transaction designed to artificially boost Isilon's revenues.  In February 2008, following an internal investigation, Isilon restated its financial statements to correct its accounting for these and other transactions.  In its federal court action against Fuhlendorf, the SEC alleges Fuhlendorf violated Section 17(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act (""Exchange Act""), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, financial penalties, forfeiture of bonuses and other compensation, and an officer-and-director bar.  In the separate settled proceeding against Isilon, the company has agreed (without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations) to be enjoined from future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. In deciding to accept Isilon's offer of settlement, the SEC took into account the cooperation that Isilon provided the SEC staff during the investigation.    SEC Complaint v.

According to the Commission, the scheme followed a simple formula: First, Reynolds purchased large blocks of the stock through corporate proxies in various unregistered offerings. Second, they attempted to dodge the registration and resale restrictions of a registration exemption under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") through bogus claims of ""regulatory exemptions"" under Securities Exchange Act Rule 504. Third, through various entities controlled by Reynolds and Wieden and controlled in the form of entities such as Beverage Creations Inc. (BCI), Reynolds' sister and husband-in-law purchased shares from her brokerage account for no money and pumped up the price of BCI stock by disseminating spam emails, an advertisement in USA Today, a commercial on CNBC and nationwide promotional mailers. The Commission alleges that these promoters hyped the shares through spam e-mail and telephone calls. Finally, as a result of their promotional activity, their stock was sold at prices that were grossly inflated by their sales. In a parallel action, on December 23 and 24, both in Dallas, Texas and Minnesota, U. S.

On April 6, 2009, the Honorable Judge Jane Boyle of the U.S. District Court in Dallas entered final judgments against Beverage Creations, Inc., former Chief Executive Officer Robert Wieden and former Chief Operating Officer Patrick Dado.  In March 2008, the SEC sued Beverage Creations, Inc. and several stock promoters alleging that they sold 30 million shares of stock to the public without a registration statement filed or in effect. According to the complaint, the stock promoters (1) purchased shares directly from Beverage Creations, Inc., (2) touted Beverage Creations, Inc. to investors through a nationwide marketing campaign, and (3) immediately dumped their shares into the public market at grossly inflated prices. The SEC also charged that Beverage Creations, Inc. participated in the touting by issuing a false press release denying any relationship between the company and one of the stock promoters. In December 2008, the SEC amended its complaint to add Beverage Creations, Inc. officers Robert Wieden and Patrick Dado. According to the amended complaint, Wieden and Dado were responsible for Beverage Creations, Inc.'s public offering, and they authored and approved the false press release. The SEC charged Beverage Creations, Inc., Wieden and Dado with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Beverage Creations, Inc., Wieden and Dado settled the action by consenting to entry of a court order that permanently bars them from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, Wieden and Dado will pay civil penalties of $20,000 each. The SEC's action against the remaining defendants is ongoing.

DAVID L. JOHNSON, Civil Action No.  05-CV-4789 (E.D.Pa.)  SEC CHARGES DAVID L. JOHNSON WITH INSIDER TRADING  JOHNSON AGREES TO PAY OVER $786,000 TO SETTLE CHARGES  On September 07, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a complaint against David L. Johnson in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Johnson committed insider trading by selling prior to the public announcement that PMA would be discontinuing its payment of a common stock dividend and increasing its carried loss reserves at its reinsurance subsidiary.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the court's approval, in which he is permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and agreed to pay disgorgement of his and his son's trading profits, plus prejudgment interest and a one time civil penalty totaling $786,449. The Commission's complaint alleges that on October 31, 2003, Johnson contacted the then Chairman of PMA's Board of Directors regarding an adverse analyst report he had received about PMA.  In response to Johnson's inquiry about the financial health of PMA, the then Chairman informed Johnson that PMA was not doing well financially, would be discontinuing its payment of a common stock dividend and increasing carried loss reserves at its reinsurance subsidiary, PMA Reinsurance.  Following this discussion and on the basis of the information he received, Johnson sold 20,000 shares of PMA stock on October 31, 2003, and 20,000 shares of PMA stock on November 3, 2003.  Further relying on the information he received, Johnson also tipped his son, who on November 2, 2003, sold 3,300 shares of PMA stock owned jointly with his wife and 3,600 shares of PMA stock in his capacity as custodian for his daughters. The Commission's complaint further alleges that PMA did not make public the information regarding the elimination of the common stock dividend and the need to increase significantly carried loss reserves at the subsidiary until November 4, 2003.  The day of PMA's public announcement, PMA's common stock closed at a price of $5.03 per share, down approximately sixty-two percent from the prior day's close of $10.00 per share.  By selling in advance of the public announcement, Johnson avoided $325,305 in losses and his son avoided $56,028 in losses.   The Commission's complaint alleges that Johnson's sales of PMA stock prior to the public announcement on November 4, 2003, violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Chelly, 11 Civ. 6277 (KSH) (D.N.J.)  SEC CHARGES FLORIDA EMPLOYEES WITH FRAUDULENT FREE-RIDING SCHEME  The United States Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Florida resident and Florida-based hedge fund manager Scottie KUPERSmith, alleging that they engaged in an illegal ""free-riding"" scheme that caused over $2 million in losses to broker-dealers.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, the defendants concealed their scheme by opening and trading through brokerage accounts in the names of corporate entities they controlled and bought and sold (or vice versa) the same quantity of same stock in different accounts, frequently on-the-same day, intending to profit on swings up or down in stock prices. When their trades were profitable, they took the profits. But when the trades threatened to result in substantial losses, however, neither of them disclosed this fact to brokers. The complaint further alleges that the scheme unraveled when they opened and traded through accounts known as Delivery Versus Payment, or ""DVP"" accounts at various broker dealers, where the brokers offered the DVP accounts to them with the understanding they held sufficient securities and cash with a third-party custodial bank to cover trades they executed in those accounts. They then ordered the separate or offsetting legs of these corresponding trades to avoid detection, and then used the proceeds from sales of shares to pay for the purchase of those same shares at significant cost to brokerage dealers. As a result of their illegal trading activity and the resulting trading profits from their illicit trading, Kupsmith is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the charges, each defendant has agreed to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a penalty of $600,000, to be determined by the court at a later date.

Scott I. Kupersmith and Frederick C. Chelly, Civil Action No. 11-CV-6277 (KSH) (D.N.J.)  SEC CHARGES TRADERS IN FRAUDULENT ""FREE-RIDING"" SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed an enforcement action against a pair of purported money managers with orchestrating an illegal ""free-riding"" scheme of selling stocks before they paid for them and netting $600,000 in illicit profits.  The SEC alleges that Florida residents Scott Kupersmith and Frederick Chelly portrayed themselves to broker-dealers as money managers for hedge funds or private investors, and they opened brokerage accounts in the names of purported investment funds they created.  Kupersmith and Chelly then engaged in illegal free-riding by interchangeably buying and selling the same quantity of the same stock in different accounts - frequently on the same day - with the intention of profiting on swings up or down in the stock price.  Unbeknownst to broker-dealers, Kupersmith and Chelly did not have sufficient securities or cash on hand to cover the trades, and they instead used proceeds from stock sales in one brokerage account to pay for the purchase of the same stock in another brokerage account.  The SEC alleges that when trades were profitable, Kupersmith and Chelly took the profits.  But when the trades threatened to result in substantial losses, Kupersmith and Chelly failed to cover their sales and left broker-dealers to settle the trades at a significant loss.  In total, their brokers suffered more than $2 million in losing trades.    According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, Kupersmith and Chelly traded through a special type of cash account that broker-dealers offer to customers with the understanding that the customer has sufficient securities and cash held with a third-party custodial bank to cover the trades that the customer makes in the account.  Kupersmith and Chelly never disclosed to broker-dealers that they were instead using proceeds from sales of shares in one brokerage account to pay for their purchase in another brokerage account.  Kupersmith and Chelly also used offshore accounts to facilitate their trading activity.  According to the SEC's complaint, the free-riding scheme occurred in 2009 and 2010, and unraveled when Kupersmith and Chelly failed to deliver shares to settle long sales in various brokerage accounts.    The SEC's complaint charges Kupersmith and Chelly with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-21 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of these provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and pay financial penalties.

Reserve Management Company, Inc., et al., Civil Action No.: 08-cv-434-CIV (SAS) (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES RESERVE MANAGEMENT COMPANY, INC., RMCI PARTNERS, AND BRUCE BENT WITH FRAUDULENTLY MISLEADING INVESTORS OF THE NEW YORK MUNICIPAL FUND  The United States Securities Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the Southern District of New York against the United Kingdom-based investment adviser and its principal, Broce Bent Sr., for their roles in a scheme to deceive the investing public into believing that the Reserve Primary Fund was safe and secure despite its substantial Lehman holdings.  According to the Commission's complaint, over a two-day period in September 2008, after the news of Lehmann Brothers' bankruptcy filing roiled the US financial markets, Defendants engaged in an unregistered offer and sale of the fund, which was the world's largest money market fund with more than $125 billion in assets. The complaint alleges that Defendants' scheme involved both the knowing dissemination of material information to investors and rating agencies and, in some cases, the telling of investors to refrain from redeeming shares and to induce new purchases of shares. In the case of Defendants, Bent and Bent II, rather than comply with their fiduciary duties as investment advisers, they placed their own financial and reputational interests ahead of those of their shareholders, and the Fund's Board of Trustees and Rating agencies. As a result, their efforts to keep the primary fund's $1.00 per share NAV safe were thwarted by the filing of false and misleading press releases claiming that they had obtained sufficient capital to maintain the $0.05 NAV. Investors were left holding the illusion that their money would remain safe despite the collapse in value and liquidity caused by massive redemption outflows from the main fund holding $785 million in illiquid debt securities issued by a distressed money fund. On September 16, 2009, although the principal fund held $10.5 billion, it was no longer in financial position to pay those redemption requests and was liquid and thus unable to generate liquidity to meet the promised returns. Moreover, contrary to their representations, defendants did not intend","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21025 / May 5, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Reserve Management Company, Inc., Resrv Partners, Inc., Bruce Bent Sr. and Bruce Bent II, Civil Action No.  09-CV-4346 (S.D.N.Y. May 5, 2009)  On May 5, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging the entities and individuals who operate The Reserve Primary Fund, including the Reserve Management Company, Inc. (RMCI), its Chairman, Bruce Bent Sr., its Vice Chairman and President, Bruce Bent II, and Resrv Partners, Inc., with fraud for failing to provide key material facts to investors and trustees about the fund's vulnerability as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. sought bankruptcy protection. The Reserve Primary Fund ""broke the buck"" on Sept. 16, 2008, when its net asset value fell below $1.00 per share, meaning investors in the money market fund would lose money. In bringing the enforcement action, the SEC also seeks to expedite the distribution of the fund's remaining assets to investors.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to provide key material information to the Primary Fund's investors, board of trustees, and ratings agencies after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15. The fund, which held $785 million in Lehman-issued securities, became illiquid on that day when the fund was unable to meet investor requests for redemptions. According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants misrepresented that RMCI would provide the credit support necessary to protect the $1 net asset value of the Primary Fund when, in fact, RMCI had no such intention.  The SEC also alleges that RMCI significantly understated the volume of redemption requests received by the fund and failed to provide the trustees with accurate information concerning the value of Lehman securities. Because of these misrepresentations and omissions, the fund was unable to strike a meaningful hourly net asset value as required by the fund's prospectus.  The complaint alleges that RMCI, Resrv Partners and Bruce Bent II violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that RMCI directly violated and Bruce Bent Sr. and Bruce Bent II directly violated and aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint further alleges violations by Bruce Bent Sr. and Bruce Bent II of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder as aiders and abettors and control persons.  The complaint names the Reserve Primary Fund as a relief defendant and seeks an order pursuant to Section 25(c) of the Investment Company Act and Section 21(d)(5) of the Exchange Act compelling a pro rata distribution of remaining fund assets which would release a significant amount of money that is currently being withheld from investors pending the outcome of numerous lawsuits against the fund, the trustees and other officers and directors of the Reserve entities.  The SEC's complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.

Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam, Civil Action No.: 11-CIV-1386 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES NEW YORK-BASED HEDGE FUND MANAGER WITH INSIDER TRADING  On September 24, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging two hedge fund managers with insider trading based on material nonpublic information they obtained while serving as members of the boards of The Goldman Sachs Group, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, and the hedge funds that they advised.  The Commission's complaint alleges that on multiple occasions, Gupta disclosed material information to a member of both companies' Boards concerning the financial results for both the second and fourth quarters of 2008, generating illicit profits and loss avoidance of more than $23 million. The complaint further alleges Gupta, who was a director of Galleon's GB Voyager Multi-Strategy Fund SPC, Ltd., traded on the basis of that information, earning profits of over $570,000. According to the complaint, in connection with the alleged scheme, Rajadnam tipped a co-conspirator at the firm that he had access to confidential information about the company's fourth quarter 2008 results, which were publicly announced on September 23, 2008. As alleged, after the merger between the two firms was announced, Goldman's stock price closed at $125.05 per share, an increase of 6.36% from the prior day's closing price of $124.50. In addition, according to The Honorable John S. Rymas, a federal judge in Manhattan, entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against the defendants, including an order barring them from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal advisor, or municipal securities dealer and from participating in any offering of a penny stock, as well as the appointment of an officer, director, nominee, receiver, tender offer, transfer agent, officer or investment manager, pursuant to Section 15(d) ofthe Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder). The order also prohibits Gupta from acting as an Officer or Director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 22140 / October 26, 2011  SEC v. Rajat Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam, Civil Action No. 11-CV-7566 (SDNY)  SEC Files Insider Trading Charges Against Rajat Gupta, Brings New Charges Against Raj Rajaratnam  On October 26, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged former McKinsey &amp; Co. global head Rajat K. Gupta with insider trading for illegally tipping convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam while serving on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G). The SEC also filed new insider trading charges against Rajaratnam after first charging him with insider trading in October 2009.  According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Gupta illegally tipped Rajaratnam with insider information about the quarterly earnings of both Goldman Sachs and P&amp;G as well as an impending $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway at the height of the financial crisis. Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Management who was recently convicted of multiple counts of insider trading in other securities stemming from unrelated insider trading schemes, allegedly caused various Galleon funds to trade based on Guptaâs inside information, generating illicit profits or loss avoidance of more than $23 million.  The SECâs complaint alleges that Gupta provided his friend and business associate Rajaratnam with confidential information learned during board calls and in other communications and meetings relating to his official duties as a director of Goldman and P&amp;G. Rajaratnam used the inside information to trade on behalf of certain Galleon funds, or shared the information with others at his firm who caused other Galleon funds to trade on it ahead of public announcements by the firms. During this period, Gupta had a variety of business dealings with Rajaratnam and stood to benefit from his relationship with him.  According to the SECâs complaint, Gupta while serving as a Goldman board member tipped Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathawayâs $5 billion investment in Goldman and Goldmanâs upcoming public equity offering before that information was publicly announced on Sept. 23, 2008. Based on this inside information, Rajaratnam arranged for Galleon funds to purchase more than 215,000 Goldman shares. Rajaratnam later informed another participant in the scheme that he received the tip on which he traded only minutes before market close. Rajaratnam caused the Galleon funds to liquidate their Goldman holdings the following day after the information became public, making illicit profits of more than $800,000.  The SEC also alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam to inside information about Goldmanâs positive financial results for the second quarter of 2008. There was a flurry of calls between Gupta and Rajaratnam on the evening of June 10, 2008, after Gupta learned from Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein of the firmâs quarterly earnings results, which were significantly better than analyst consensus estimates. The following morning, minutes after the markets opened, Rajaratnam caused Galleon funds to start purchasing Goldman securities including 7,350 out-of-the-money Goldman call options and 350,000 Goldman shares. Rajaratnam liquidated these positions on or around June 17 â the date when Goldman announced its quarterly earnings â generating illicit profits of more than $18.5 million for the Galleon funds.  The SECâs complaint further alleges that Gupta tipped Rajaratnam with confidential information that Gupta learned during an Oct. 23, 2008, board posting call about Goldmanâs impending negative financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008. Mere seconds after the board call ended, Gupta tipped Rajaratnam, who then arranged for certain Galleon funds to begin selling their Goldman holdings shortly after the financial markets opened the following day until the funds finished selling off their holdings, which had consisted of more than 150,000 shares. In discussing trading and market information that day with another participant in the insider trading scheme, Rajaratnam explained that while Wall Street expected Goldman to earn $2.50 per share, he heard the prior day from a Goldman board member that the company was actually going to lose $2 per share. As a result of Rajaratnamâs trades based on inside information provided by Gupta, the Galleon funds avoided losses of more than $3.6 million.  The SECâs complaint additionally alleges that Gupta illegally disclosed to Rajaratnam inside information about P&amp;Gâs financial results for the quarter ending December 2008. Gupta participated in a telephonic meeting of P&amp;Gâs Audit Committee at 9 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2009, to discuss the planned release of P&amp;Gâs quarterly earnings the next day. A draft of the earnings release, which had been mailed to Gupta and the other committee members two days before the meeting, indicated that P&amp;Gâs expected organic sales would be less than previously publicly predicted. Gupta called Rajaratnam in the early afternoon on January 29, and Rajaratnam shortly afterwards informed another participant in the insider trading scheme that he had learned from a contact on P&amp;Gâs board that the companyâs organic sales growth would be lower than expected. Galleon funds then sold short approximately 180,000 P&amp;G shares, making illicit profits of more than $570,000.  The SECâs complaint charges each of the defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge on a joint and several basis their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay financial penalties. The complaint also seeks to permanently prohibit Gupta from acting as an officer or director of any registered public company, and to permanently enjoin him from associating with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.  The SEC previously instituted an administrative proceeding against Gupta for the conduct alleged in todayâs enforcement action, but later dismissed those proceedings while reserving the right to file an action against Gupta in federal court.  The SEC previously charged Rajaratnam and others in the widespread insider trading investigation centering on Galleon, the multi-billion dollar New York hedge fund complex founded and controlled by Rajaratnam.  The SEC has now charged 29 defendants in its Galleon-related enforcement actions, which have alleged widespread and repeated insider trading at numerous hedge funds, including Galleon, and by other professional traders and corporate insiders in the securities of more than 15 companies. The insider trading generated illicit profits totaling more than $90 million.

Panther, Jr., and Faiyaz Dean with orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for shares of microcap company Biozoom, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that from May 2012 through June 2013, defendants engaged in manipulative trading to effect illegal, unregistered offers and sales of stock to retail investors and others at artificially inflated prices. The complaint further alleges the defendants' deceptive conduct created the false appearance that the stock was legally available for sale to the general public and the price and trading volume of the company were determined by the interplay of market supply and demand, rather than artificially generated through manipulative manipulation. In addition, as part of their scheme, they schemed to conceal their control over the shares by placing them in names of Argentine nationals (the ""Argentine Nominees""), who had no economic interest, and by helping Panther with the creation of brokerage accounts in their names, which they used for manipulative coordinated bidding to keep the share price propped up. As a result of this conduct, BioZoom's stock price rose by more than $34 million, generating approximately $32 million in illicit proceeds from the illegal trading. Dean, a British Columbia law student, was charged with coordinating the scheme with Antonio Conte, an attorney who was also charged in a related criminal case. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Dean consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be determined at a later date by a court-approved administrative proceeding.

424,"U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20691 / April 18, 2002  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Nos.   17/18/2002  SEC v. Scott C. Anixter, Carl E. Putnam, John P. Spinell, and Renee L. LeVault, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Civil Action No.: 02-C-3235 (N.D. Ill.)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it has filed an amended complaint alleging that Anicom, Inc., a Chicago-based manufacturer of wire and cable products and related services, engaged in a massive financial fraud in which it falsely reported millions of dollars of nonexistent sales, including sales to a fictitious customer, to the public in 1998 and 1999. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from 1998 through 2000, the defendants, with the assistance of the company's former Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and former Controller, used a variety of fraudulent techniques to artificially inflate its revenues and net income by more than $20 million. To conceal the fraud, certain of them, along with former Senior Vice President of Sales Daryl T.Spinelli, Chief Operating Officer John A. Figurelli of Naperville, Illinois and Billing Manager Ronald M. Bandyk of Libertyville, Ill., improperly recognized numerous sales that inflated reported revenues, net profits and income. Additionally, Aniciom's external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, improperly inflated purchase rebates accrued and accelerated the recognition of sales between reporting periods. When the alleged fraud was uncovered by the Commission in July 2000 and unsealed on November 26, 2000 the Complaint was filed, without admitting or denying the allegations, in the complaint. In its action, which was amended on April 19, 2001, it was also amended to add the following allegations:  Anemicom filed at least nine materially false and misleading periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10K reports between January 1, 1998, March 30, 1999 and April 5, 2004 that overstated its reported revenue by over $80 million; Aniom failed to file its quarterly and annual reports for fiscal year 2000 that contained all information necessary to ensure that the statements contained in those reports were accurate and fairly reflected its assets and recorded transactions in order to permit the financial statements to conform","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  LITIGATION RELEASE NO.  18823 / August 9, 2004  ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING ENFORCEMENT RELEASE NO.  2077 / August 9, 2004  United States Securities and Exchange Commission v. Scott C. Anixter, et al., No. 02-C-3235 (N.D. Ill.) (Marovich, J.).  Scott C. Anixter, Former Chairman of the Board of Anicom, Inc., Charged With Fraud  On July 29, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that added Scott C. Anixter, the former Chairman of the Board of Anicom, Inc., as a defendant to its lawsuit against six top executives and other employees of the now-defunct company.  Anixter, age 55, is a resident of Glencoe, Illinois.  The Commission's amended complaint alleges that from January 1, 1998 through March 30, 2000, Anixter and the other defendants carried out a massive financial fraud at Anicom in which they falsely reported millions of dollars of non-existent sales, including sales to a fictitious customer, and used other fraudulent techniques to inflate Anicom's net income by more than $20 million.  To conceal the fraud, certain of the defendants lied to Anicom's outside auditors, lied to the Audit Committee of Anicom's Board of Directors in an internal investigation, and withheld information from the Commission's staff.  When aspects of the fraud were eventually revealed to the public, Anicom's shareholders lost more than $80 million.  The Commission's amended complaint alleges that the fraud had two distinct aspects.  First, Anixter and his co-defendants, President and Chief Executive Officer Carl E. Putnam, Vice President of Sales Daryl T. Spinell, Chief Operating Officer John P. Figurelli, and Billing Manager Renee L. LeVault, improperly recognized numerous sales that inflated reported revenues and net profits.  Additionally, Chief Financial Officer Donald C. Welchko, Figurelli, LeVault, and defendant Vice President of Accounting Ronald M. Bandyk, C.P.A., with Anixter and Putnam's knowledge, caused Anicom in 1999 to, among other things, improperly recognize more than $11.7 million in sales to a fictitious customer called SCL Integration Corp. to minimize the effect on income of writing off earlier improper sales.  Second, Anixter and Welchko improperly manipulated Anicom's expenses to bring the company's financial results in line with, or at least closer to, analysts' expectations.  To that end, Welchko and Bandyk engaged in fraud by improperly charging certain expenses to a reserve account and a restructuring charge, unjustifiably inflating purchase rebates accrued, and accelerating the recognition of sales between reporting periods.  As a result of the defendants' misconduct, Anicom filed with the Commission at least nine materially false and misleading periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K reports between January 1, 1998 and March 30, 2000 that, among other things, overstated the company's revenues by more than $38 million.  The Commission's amended complaint alleges that the defendants' conduct violated the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping, internal controls, and lying to the auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission requests that the court issue a final judgment of permanent injunction and other relief, enjoining certain of the defendants from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder.  The Commission seeks civil monetary penalties from each of the defendants, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from Anixter, Putnam, Welchko, Figurelli, Bandyk, and Spinell.  The Commission also seeks an order permanently barring Anixter, Putnam, Welchko, Figurelli, Spinell, and Bandyk from acting as officers and directors of any public company.  The Commission filed its lawsuit on May 6, 2002.  Additional information regarding the Commission's lawsuit can be found in Litigation Release No. 17504, May 6, 2002.

Nicolas Patrick Condroyer and Gilles Robert Roger, Civil Action No.: 09-CV-3600 (N.D. Ga.)  SEC Files Settled Insider Trading Action Against Former Chattem, Inc. Officer and Former Employee Charged With Illegal Trading   On December 1, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charging Nicolas P. ""Nic"" Condrouer, a former officer and director of the Atlanta Regional Office, with engaging in illegal insider trading.  The Commission's complaint alleges that between December 7,2009 and December 17, 2010, Nicolas, then a resident of Brussels, Belgium, purchased call options on the securities of a French health care company while in possession of material, non-public information concerning an impending acquisition of Chattem by Sanofi-Aventis. The options had strike prices, i.e., the price at which the option holder could acquire shares, of $75 or $80. According to the complaint, all but 25 of these option contracts were set to expire by the time they were purchased. In total, these options were worth approximately $42,000, and the defendants were able to sell their options combined profits of over $1.8 million. Without admitting or denying the charges, Roger consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, plus a $2.4 million civil penalty. Roger agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to entry of an order imposing a permanent injunction from further violations and ordering the return of any ill-gotten gains or losses avoided in connection with the sale of options, which would be deemed satisfied by payment of restitution in a related criminal case. On the same day, on December 20, 2011, Judge Roger entered a temporary restraining order against Roger from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 6(c), and 17(e) ofÂ the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 13(1), 15(2)(A), 16(B)(B), &nbsp;13(d)(2), 14(f), 17 (a)(1)","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21347 / December 23, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

GA)  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OBTAINS EMERGENCY ASSET FREEZE AGAINST PURCHASERS OF CALL OPTIONS FOR CHATTEM, INC. PRIOR TO ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT  Orders Placed Just Days Prior to $1.9 Billion Acquisition Announcement; $4.2 Million Now Frozen  On December 22nd , 2009 the Honorable Charles A. Pannell, Jr., U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, entered a Temporary Restraining Order freezing assets of Nicolas Patrick Benoit Condroyer and Gilles Robert Roger, both of whom are citizens of France and reside in Brussels, Belgium. The Commission's complaint alleges that Condroyer and Roger engaged in illegal insider trading, in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to freezing approximately $4.2 million in assets, the Court's order: (i) provides for expedited discovery, and (ii) prohibits the defendants from destroying evidence.  On December 21, 2009, Chattem, Inc., a company based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Sanofi-Aventis, a health care company located in France. Chattem manufactures and markets an array of the over-the-counter healthcare products and its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Under the acquisition agreement, Sanofi agreed to pay $1.9 billion for 100% of Chattem's outstanding shares, at a share price of $93.50 per share. According to the complaint, the acquisition share price represents a 32.6% premium above the closing price of $69.98 on the prior trading day, Friday, December 18th.  The Commission further alleges that between December 7 and December 18, 2009, Condroyer, while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding this acquisition, purchased over 1,900 ""out-of-the-money"" call option contracts for Chattem stock in a newly-opened account at an options brokerage firm in the United States. Substantially all of those contracts were set to expire on January 15, 2010, within weeks of the purchase date.  The Commission similarly alleges that on December 17 and December 18, 2009, Roger, while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding this acquisition, purchased 940 ""out-of-the-money"" call option contracts for Chattem in an account at an options brokerage firm in the United States. According to the complaint, Roger had only opened this account on December 14, 2009. All of the call option contracts purchased by Roger were set to expire on January 15, 2010, within weeks of the purchase date, according to the complaint.  The complaint further alleges that, on December 21, 2009, after the acquisition was announced, Condroyer and Roger sold all of their call option contracts, generating illicit profits of approximately $2.8 million for Condroyer and $1.4 million for Roger. Since the accounts were opened, the complaint alleges that there have been no transactions in either account other than the purchase and sale of Chattem call options.  The Commission alleges that Condroyer and Roger violated of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition to the emergency relief, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil monetary penalties.

426,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a New York-based penny stock company and its former chief executive officer for misleading investors about the company's financial condition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New Jersey, alleges that beginning in at least 2013, the former CEO of an investment bank and his former co-conspirator at the time, Robert A. Birkenheier, made misleading statements to investors in connection with the firm's business operations, including that he would use investor funds to pay for his personal expenses, and that the client would receive a return on his investment if he sold the stock at a reasonable price. The complaint alleges, however, that these representations were false and misleading because, in reality, Birkinheer was not a registered broker-dealer and had no control over the securities of the issuers.Â   According to the complaint and SEC complaint filed on August 2, 2018, between 2013 and 2017, a total of more than $1.2 million was raised from investors who were told that their money would be used to fund a lavish lifestyle, such as a luxury automobile, luxury apartment, jewelry, travel, sports equipment, sporting events, entertainment, retail stores, hotels, casinos, restaurants, golf courses, retirement savings, vacations, home renovations, car rentals, student loans, credit card bills, mortgage payments and other non-recurring expenses. In addition, as alleged by the SEC in its complaint:   (a) the CEO misled investors by falsely telling them that his company would generate annual returns of over $600,000, when in fact it did not.&nbsp; (b) he lied about his own income and income tax history and failed to disclose that, among other things, he had misappropriated approximately $3.5 million from his wife, who was also a member of his family's investment advisory advisory firm, for which he was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b)(2)(A), 13(c)(3), and 15(d) (collectively the ""Securities Act"") and the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 12b3-2 and 13a-11 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in SEC filings or any other","On August 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Plandai Biotechnology, Inc., a penny stock company, and its Chairman and CEO with making illegal, unregistered sales of stock to unaccredited investors and with failing to adequately disclose that proceeds from sales of Plandai stock were sent to a private company owned by the CEO.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York, from November 2013 through January 2015, Plandai, acting through Roger Duffield, made unregistered offers and sales of Plandai common stock to at least two unaccredited and unsophisticated investors.  In addition, although the shares in question had been newly issued and sold directly to the investors by Plandai, Duffield allegedly instructed the investors to wire their payments to a private company that he owned and controlled.  Plandai's annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, misleadingly stated that Plandai had received cash in exchange for the shares, and did not disclose that the proceeds from the sale were actually sent to Duffield's private company.  Although Duffield, through his private company, ultimately paid various Plandai business expenses in amounts approximating the payments that had been received from the investors, Plandai did not accurately and fairly record these transactions in its books and records.  Plandai's failure to properly record these transactions allegedly resulted from its lack of a sufficient system of internal accounting controls.  The SEC's complaint charges Plandai and Duffield with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also charges Plandai with violating, and Duffield aiding and abetting violations of, the reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

427,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Earl D. Miller of Goshen, Indiana, and two companies he controlled, 5 Star Commercial, LLC (5 Star Capital) and its owner, Earl Miller, for defrauding at least 70 investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on November 5, 2015, Miller and his companies raised approximately $2.28 million and $1.62 million respectively from investors in six states between July 2014 and July 2015. The complaint alleges that Miller told investors that 5Star Capital owned patents on many of the ""green"" products and that he would use the funds to invest in real estate when, in reality, he invested and/or transferred over $600,000 of investor funds into highly speculative, fledgling companies that purportedly made and marketed ""federally-distributed"" energy saving products. In fact, the complaint further alleges Miller misappropriated more than $650,435 of 5 star Capital's assets to pay off a former business partner and to fund a personal debt owed to a friend. As a result, investors are losing their entire life savings, according to one investor's letter of intent. Without admitting or denying the allegations in his SEC complaint filed against Miller in federal court in Indianapolis, five of his entities have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provision of Sections 5(d), 5 (a), and (c) with respect to Miller's other entities and the offer and sale of unregistered securities in these entities. Additionally, on July 29, 2014, a cease-and-desist letter from Miller was issued in response to an enforcement action filed by the Department of Justice in which Miller pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aiding and abetting the violations of federal securities laws, including the issuance of false and misleading press releases, registration statements and other documents. On November 6, 2016, Judge James B. Donahue entered a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants' assets and appointing a receiver over the assets of all defendants, which will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties that will be determined by a court at a later date upon motion by Miller.

In raising money for his private funds, Miller - then based in Mishawaka, Indiana - touted his Amish heritage to raise money from the Indiana and Michigan Amish community and encouraged his victims to invest their retirement savings in his funds.

The SEC alleged that, while Miller promised he would not be paid for managing the funds, he took over $1.1 million of investor money to pay himself and to buy out his former business partner. The SEC further alleged that Miller lied to investors about the nature of their investments and purported safeguards, which he never implemented. When Miller's investments failed, his funds collapsed and 72 investors lost over $4.1 million. On August 10, 2017, the Court entered a default judgment against Miller for his repeated failures to comply with discovery orders.

The complaint further alleged that the City hired a broker-dealer and municipal securities dealer to underwrite the offering, and that a city employee directed the employee to submit two invoices for $22,000 to a municipal adviser for payment. According to SEC filings, both invosions were fraudulent because they were not part of the original agreement and the bond trustee did not authorize or agree to any additional charges.

Malachi is registered as a municipal advisor with both the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (""MSRB""). According to the complaint, after the offering closed, Malachi and Bingham submitted two invoices to the bond trustee for payment. The SEC alleges that one of those invoices was fraudulent, because it was for services that Malachi and Bingham did not perform and the city did not authorize. The complaint also alleges that Bingham failed to disclose to the city that he had accepted payments totaling $2,500 from Anthony Stovall, an employee of a municipal underwriter, shortly before he and Malachi recommended that the city hire Stovall's firm to underwrite the bond offering.

The SEC also announced that Judge Joseph N. Laplante of the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire has issued a temporary restraining order that, among other things, freezes the assets of the company and its principal and prohibits them from continuing to solicit or accept investor funds.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Henry Roche, a Canadian resident, through New Futures Trading International Corporation has been engaged in an ongoing unregistered offering of securities in the United States through operations in New Hampshire and Ontario, Canada.  According to the Complaint, since December 2010  Roche has raised over $1.3 million from at least 14 investors in nine states through the offer and sale of high yield promissory notes purportedly yielding either 5-10% per month, or a 200% return within 14 months.

The ""Prime Bank"" scheme represented to victims that they could, after investing, draw upon bank issued guarantees worth millions of dollars without incurring a corresponding obligation to repay the withdrawn funds. In some cases, KEGLEY told investors that the investor would receive a 40,000% return on the investment and that he and his company, Prism, were responsible for introducing six individuals who invested $1.95 million into the scheme. However, no bank guarantee was ever obtained and the defendants misappropriated investor funds for their own personal use. Additionally, according to a complaint filed in federal district court in Atlanta, Defendants provided investors with written agreements that their funds would be used to purchase the described bank guarantees; and (b) held in escrow until the bank guaranteed was funded. As a result, defendants received commissions from investors who transferred funds to accounts controlled by Defendants. Finally, a consent order has been entered against Defendants imposing a permanent injunction but leaving monetary issues for later resolution to be determined by the court upon motion by a motion filed by each defendant. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, all defendants have consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5 (c), and ordering them to pay disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions from further violations. Defendants also agreed to undertakes to cooperate with the SEC's continuing investigation of this matter.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 22361 / May 8, 2012  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gerald D. Kegley, et al., Case No. 1:12-CV-1605 (N.D. Ga)  SEC Charges Arizona Resident with Securities Fraud  The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) filed a civil injunctive action in Atlanta, Georgia on May 8, 2102, alleging that Gerald D. Kegley (&#8220;Kegley&#8221;) and the company he operates, Prism Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;Prism&#8221;), participated in a fraudulent &#8220;Prime Bank&#8221; scheme that violated the antifraud and securities and broker dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.    The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that from at least April 8, 2010 through at least August 20, 2010, the defendants were directly responsible for introducing six individuals, who invested $1.95 million, to the fraudulent scheme.  The complaint alleges that in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants forwarded misrepresentations made by others to investors.  These misrepresentations included:  1) that investors could draw upon bank issued guarantees worth millions of dollars without having to repay the withdrawn funds; and 2) that investor funds would be held in escrow until the bank guarantees were issued.  The complaint alleges that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that both of these representations were false because no such bank guarantees existed and investor funds were misappropriated immediately upon receipt.  Defendants also misrepresented that they would be paid commissions only once the investor received the bank guarantee.  In fact, defendants were paid commissions relatively soon after the investors transferred the money.  Defendants further told investors that they had previously worked on a successful bank guarantee program.  Defendants, however, had actually reported this purportedly successful bank guarantee program to the Federal Bureau of Investigation because they believed it was a fraud.   In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The Commission also alleges that defendants aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

431,"On December 14, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Arizona residents with insider trading in the securities of International Rectifier Corporation.  According to the SEC's complaint, Lanny Brown and Sean Fox traded on confidential information about the pending acquisition of the company by another company, and then used the money to pay Brown's personal expenses and pay Fox's wife, minor and adult children, former son-in-law, contractors, contractor and others who were renovating their home in Chandler, Arizona. The SEC alleges that Brown was not only prohibited by company policy from trading on material, nonpublic information, but was also subject to a ""blackout"" period"" at the time, which barred him from engaging in such trading while the acquisition deal was being negotiated and finalized. Brown also allegedly tipped Fox with the information and used his wife's brokerage account to purchase the call options just a week before the August 20, 2014 announcement of a merger between the two companies. When the merger was publicly announced, Brown tipped his friend, Fox, about it and they both closed out their options positions, collectively reaping $369,720 in illegal profits from their illicit trading. In doing so, they created a scheme to conceal Brown&#8217;s involvement, funneling $148,160.48 in illicit profits to Brown, who is a minor child and whose mother is an adult and lives in Arizona with her husband and children. As alleged, in a parallel action, a federal court entered a temporary restraining order halting the illegal trading and freezing the assets of both defendants and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona and obtained an order freezing their assets and prohibiting them from participating in any future violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1)(A), 207(2)(B), and 207 (2) under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) (FGCRA) in connection with this matter. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all defendants have consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions and from further violations, including the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of securities by the Commission and Section 20(d) for a total of $1.5 million, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a former employee of a semiconductor company and his friend for trading on nonpublic information that the company would be acquired.  The SEC alleges that Lanny Brown learned that Infineon Technologies AG planned to acquire his then-employer, International Rectifier Corp. (IRC), before the deal was publicly announced.  According to the SEC's complaint, Brown tipped his friend, Sean Fox, about the deal and both of them then acquired IRC call options.  The SEC further alleges that Brown and Fox concealed Brown's involvement in the trading by depositing approximately $12,000 of their combined funds into Fox's brokerage account, and then used this account to purchase the call options for both of them.  The SEC also alleges that Fox closed out the option positions after the acquisition was publicly announced, and the two defendants made $369,720 in illicit profits.  To further hide Brown's role in the trading, Fox allegedly funneled Brown's share of the trading profits by paying several of Brown's personal expenses and by writing checks to Brown's children and stepchildren.  Brown and his wife then endorsed those checks and used the funds.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Arizona, charges Brown and Fox with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  A criminal action is also pending against both Brown and Fox in the District of Arizona for the same underlying conduct.  In the SEC's action, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  The final judgment in the SEC's action also orders them to pay, on a joint and several basis, disgorgement of $369,720 plus prejudgment interest of $43,147.79, with a credit for the monetary amount they have agreed to pay in the parallel criminal case against them.

Matthew Ming-Chang Chiang, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action No C 04-04145 SIPLAINT (N.D. Cal. filed Dec. 4)  SEC CHARGES FORMER Clarent Corporation OFFICER WITH FRAUD  The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the U. S. district court for San Francisco, California alleging that former CFO Matthew ""Chiang,"" of Redwood City, Calif., engaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the company's revenue in its annual and quarterly filings with the Commission during 2000 and 2001. According to the complaint, during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2000, he participated in oral promises to a Taiwanese customer that if the customer placed a $7.2 million order for an unsold product, it would have Articula Corporation, which he controlled, purchase the product. The complaint further alleges that in late June 2001, after the Taiwan office staff discovered the improper transfer of $25 million in cash to another customer, the Chinese customer cancelled the order and returned it to its owner, causing the false revenue to be misstated. As a result of this conduct, Clâs reported revenue for its Asia Pacific region was materially overstated by about 15%.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, and with respect to his cooperation, a court order has been entered by the Honorable Judge James B. Donnelly in federal court in San Diego, CA, to order a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and to pay civil penalties. In a related administrative proceeding, filed on December 2, 2002, Judge Connelly entered a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of all three defendants and ordered the repatriation of assets.

MATTHEW M. CHIANG, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, No. C 04-4145 SI  COMMISSION FILES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST FORMER SALES EXECUTIVE OF CLARENT CORPORATION  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has filed financial accounting fraud charges against the former President of the Asia Pacific office of Redwood City, California-based Clarent Corporation.  His misconduct, and that of another Clarent executive, led Clarent, a now-bankrupt provider of Internet telephone products, to overstate its revenue by 33% for the fourth quarter of 2000, and by 23% and 39% respectively for the first two quarters of 2001.  The Commission sued Clarent's former President of Asia Pacific operations Matthew M. Chiang, 35, of Taipei, Taiwan, for allegedly inflating Clarent's revenue through fraudulent sales transactions and siphoning cash to a company in which Chiang and his family held influential positions.    The complaint alleges that, in December 2000, Chiang induced a Taiwanese technology firm to place orders of approximately $7 million for Clarent hardware and software by promising that, if the firm could not resell the products, Clarent would arrange for a company associated with Chiang's family to buy the goods (as in fact ultimately occurred).  These side arrangements made it improper for Clarent to recognize revenue for the sales, but, according to the complaint, Chiang concealed the secret deal terms from Clarent's finance personnel, causing the company to report phony revenue to the public.  The Commission further alleges that, in June 2001, Chiang directed the unauthorized release of $35 million from Clarent's Asia Pacific office to the Chiang-related entity.  The $35 million cash disbursement was not disclosed to Clarent's financial personnel or management.  This improper payment caused Clarent to overstate its cash.  The complaint additionally alleges that, between March 2001 and June 2001, he provided customers in Asia with undisclosed rights to cancel orders or return product to Clarent on another $31 million in purported sales, making it improper for Clarent to include revenue from the orders in its publicly reported financial statements.  The Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, charges Chiang with violating the antifraud, corporate reporting, books and records and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement, monetary penalties, and orders barring them from serving as officers or directors of public companies.   	In particular, the Commission asserts claims against Chiang for violations of Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Securities Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1  and 13b2-2 thereunder as well as for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.    In a related matter, the Commission filed a separate action against former Chief Executive Officer, Jerry S. Chang, charging him with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, corporate reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.)  In addition, the complaint alleges that Chang aided and abetted Clarent's violations of certain of these provisions.

Chevron Corporation, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No 1:07-CV-0079 (RMZ)  SEC CHARGES CHEVRON CORPORATION WITH ACCOUNTING VIOLATIONS  On August 29, 2005, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Chevron Corp. charging that it violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when third parties with which Chevron contracted made approximately $20 million in illegal surcharge payments in connection with Chevron's purchases of crude oil under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the ""Program"").  The Commission's complaint alleges that from approximately April 2001 through May 2002, Chevron, through its subsidiaries, paid kickbacks to Iraq in the form of surcharges on shipments of Iraqi oil from Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO).  Chevron knew or should have known that these payments bypassed the escrow account and were instead paid to Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan and Lebanon. The complaint further alleges the following:  In purchasing Iraqi Oil, Shell paid a premium above the Official Selling Price (OSP) established by the U.N. and international trade sanctions on Iraq. In order to eliminate Iraqi demand for oil, and to prevent the imposition of duties on the Iraqi contracts by SOMO and other Iraqi government officials; Chevron failed to devise and maintain a system of infernal accounting controls sufficient to detect and prevent such illicit payments; and  Shell failed, among other things, to properly record the amounts paid in its books or records. As a result of this conduct, according to the complaint: Chevron violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1 and 13a-11 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint, all defendants have consented to entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of these provisions and require Chevron to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038.80, plus a $25,000 civil penalty.

Chevron Corporation, Civil Action No. 07 CIV 10299 (S.D.N.Y.) (SHS)  SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges Against Chevron Corporation For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program &mdash; Company Agrees to Pay a Total of $30 Million  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Chevron Corporation (""Chevron""), a California-based oil company, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The Commission's complaint alleges that from approximately April 2001 through May 2002, third parties with which Chevron contracted paid approximately $20 million in illegal kickback payments in connection with Chevron's purchases of crude oil under the U.N. Oil for Food Program.  Chevron knew or should have known that third parties paid a portion of the premiums they received from Chevron to Iraq as illegal surcharges.  The Oil for Food Program provided humanitarian relief to the Iraqi population during the time that Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions.  However, the surcharges paid by third parties in connection with Chevron's purchases of oil bypassed the escrow account and were instead paid to Iraqi-controlled bank accounts in Jordan and Lebanon.  According to the Commission's Complaint:  From April 17, 2001 through May 6, 2002, Chevron purchased approximately 78 million barrels of crude oil from Iraq pursuant to 36 contracts with third parties.  Chevron's traders entered into oil transactions with third parties that included the payment of $20 million in illegal surcharges to Iraq.  In January 2001, after learning of surcharge demands by Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization (""SOMO""), Chevron implemented a company-wide policy prohibiting the payment of surcharges in connection with the purchase of Iraqi oil from third parties.  Among other things, the policy required traders to obtain prior written approval for all proposed Iraqi oil purchases, and charged management with reviewing each proposed Iraqi oil deal.  Chevron's traders did not follow the company-wide policy and Chevron's management was unsuccessful in ensuring its compliance.  Despite being required to consider the identity, experience and reputation of a third party seller prior to approving a proposed Iraqi oil purchase, Chevron's management relied on its trader's representations.  In one such instance, a credit check by Chevron of a proposed third party seller revealed that the seller was a ""brass plate company.""  This meant that the company had no experience in the oil business, no real business operations, and no known assets.  Despite concerns on the part of Chevron's management, Chevron entered into two transactions to purchase three million barrels of oil from the third party in January 2002.  Illegal surcharges were paid on both of these transactions and passed back to Chevron in inflated premiums.  At least one trader responsible for a large portion of Chevron's purchases from Iraq factored the cost of the surcharge payments into price negotiations with third parties.  One third party seller, whose company on occasion sold oil to Chevron, stated that the trader he dealt with at Chevron and the trader's bosses always knew about the illegal surcharge demands by Iraq.  At one point, the Chevron trader even asked the third party seller to persuade Iraq to reduce the amount of its surcharges.  Chevron's own internal documents show that it was well aware of the costs of doing business with Iraq.  Chevron's premium payments to third parties increased after Iraq's surcharge demands began.  Despite the obvious increase in premiums, Chevron's management routinely approved the Iraqi oil purchases proposed by Chevron's traders.  Chevron failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls to detect and prevent such illicit payments.  Chevron's accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed properly to record the true nature of the company's payments to third parties.  Chevron, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $25,000,000 in profits, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000,000.  Chevron will satisfy its disgorgement obligation by forfeiting $20,000,000 pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and paying disgorgement of $5,000,000 pursuant to an agreement with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.  Chevron will also pay the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Department of Treasury a penalty of $2,000,000.  Since being approached by the Commission's staff, Chevron has cooperated with the Commission's investigation, which is continuing.

SEC Files Fraud Action Against ACLN, Ltd., Three Officers and the Company's Auditing Firm, BDO Cyprus  Action Seeks Repatriation of $45 Million in Frozen Funds  Today the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against ACLN, Ltd., a Cyprus corporation operating from Antwerp, Belgium that purportedly ships used vehicles to North and East Africa and sells new cars in that region.  The complaint alleges that, from 1998 through the third quarter of 2001, ACLN was the vehicle for an exceptionally bold and elaborate financial fraud that resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to investors in the U.S. and abroad.  Defendants Abderrazak &quot;Aldo&quot; Labiad, Joseph J.H. Bisschops and Alex de Ridder, who controlled the Company, are alleged by the Commission to have constructed a fraudulent scheme to represent ACLN as a substantial business entity with escalating profits when it was, in fact, little more than a shell company.   From 1998 through 2001, specifically, they caused ACLN to grossly misrepresent its revenues and income, fabricate an entire line of business, and claim ownership of assets that did not exist or it did not own.  The Commission alleges that Labiad, Bisschops and de Ridder exploited their financial fraud by selling over $80 million in ACLN stock at inflated prices.  The common stock of ACLN was traded on the Nasdaq National Market System and, additionally, on the New York Stock Exchange until March 18, 2002, when it was de-listed immediately following a Commission trading suspension.  ACLN's market capitalization reached approximately $700 million in September 2001, but has subsequently declined to a nominal amount.  The Commission's complaint names ACLN's former president, Labiad, former CEO, Bisschops, and former COO Ridder; three offshore corporations through which those individuals are alleged to have engaged in fraudulent stock transactions: Emerald Sea Marine, Scott Investments and Pearlrose Holdings; and six relief defendants alleged to be holding proceeds of the illegal conduct.  Also named are ACLN's former auditors, the Cyprus affiliate of BDO International (&quot;BDO Cyprus&quot;), and two BDO Cyprus partners, Minas Ioannou and Christakis Ioannou, all of whom have agreed to settle this matter.  The Commission and agencies of other governments working in cooperation with it have frozen approximately $45 million in bank accounts in Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco, which the Commission will seek to repatriate for distribution to defrauded shareholders.  According to the Commission's complaint:     In its Commission filings and press releases in 2000 and 2001, ACLN significantly overstated the volume of its used car transactions, and claimed substantial revenue from a purported new car sales operation that, in fact, never existed;   In a particularly brazen aspect of the fraud, ACLN grossly misrepresented the amount of its cash assets from 1998 through the third quarter of 2001.  For example, in its financial statements for the nine months ending September 30, 2001, ACLN claimed to have bank deposits of over $117 million.  The actual balance at that time was less than $2 million.  This deception was furthered through the creation of forged bank documents that ACLN provided to its auditors;   ACLN does not own the largest physical asset on its balance sheet, the car-carrier vessel the Sea Atef, and, in any event, significantly inflated the vessel's value;   ACLN's auditors, BDO International (Cyprus), furthered the scheme by failing to conduct even the most basic audit procedures that would have detected ACLN's financial fraud and forgery of bank account statements.  BDO Cyprus issued audit reports for fiscal years 1995 through 2000 that falsely stated that its audits were conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and that ACLN's financial statements were fairly presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The audit reports also falsely represented BDO Cyprus to be independent of its audit client when, in fact, its independence was compromised because an affiliate of BDO Cyprus prepared ACLN's books and records;   Defendants Labiad, Bisschops and de Ridder exploited the success of their financial fraud by selling over $80 million of their holdings of ACLN stock at inflated prices.  To conceal their role in these transactions, and make the proceeds of the fraud difficult to trace, they acted through a complicated web of offshore corporations and bank accounts, created to facilitate the scheme; and   These stock sales were conducted without compliance with the registration requirements of the securities laws and were not publicly disclosed, as required by law.

Securities &amp; Exchange Act (&quot;Exchange Act&quo;) announced today that it filed a settled insider trading action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against two former directors and two of their business associates for their roles in a fraudulent scheme to illegally buy shares of the Florida-based equipment rental company.   According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, Kevan Acord, an attorney, and Philip Growney, a certified public accountant, engaged in close personal and professional relationships with two brothers, Sebastian De La Maza and Alberto Perez, both of Kansas. The complaint alleges that the two misappropriated material, non-public information about the pending acquisition of a company from which the brothers were friends. They then used the information to buy $282,000 worth of stock in advance of an April 7, 2004 announcement of that companyâs acquisition by Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC. According, the complaint further alleges, during the weeks preceding the acquisition announcement, de La maza abused his position of trust and confidence with the CEO, who was a close friend of his and his brother. He used a client trust fund to fund some of these purchases. Finally, Thomas Borell, also a self-employed accountant and a member of two family businesses, purchased shares at a profit of more than $1.3 million. As a result of this trading activity, Neoff's stock price increased 51%, closing at $7.41 per share, from a loss of $12,954 the day before it announced its acquisition.

In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Kevan Acord, an attorney and accountant, and his partner, Philip Growney, an accountant, abused their position of trust and confidence as tax consultants to Neff when they bought $329,000 of Neff stock in the nine days before the announcement. According to the complaint, they bought the shares after learning during their work for Neff that another company might acquire it. Following the acquisition, Acord exchanged shares that he purchased for his personal account and for the account of a long time client for a profit of nearly $155,000.  The complaint also alleges that Alberto Perez, a business associate and close friend of Neff's CEO, learned of the possible acquisition while working at an office at Neff's headquarters two doors down from the acquisition due diligence teams. Perez abused his position of trust and confidence with the CEO, and misappropriated the information by tipping his brother Jose Perez. The complaint alleges that the two then used the information to purchase $282,000 of Neff stock for a brokerage account they jointly owned, in advance of the acquisition announcement. Following the acquisition, the Perezes exchanged their Neff shares for a profit of $399,000.  The complaint further alleges that Dr. Sebastian De La Maza, the father-in-law of Neff's CEO, learned about the pending acquisition from his daughter, who is married to Neff's CEO. According to the complaint, during the weeks preceding the acquisition announcement, De La Maza abused his position of trust and confidence with his daughter and misappropriated this information to buy $111,000 of Neff stock. Following the acquisition, De La Maza exchanged the Neff shares for a profit of $84,000.  Finally, the Commission's complaint alleges that Thomas Borell, a Miami lawyer and a close friend of a Neff director misappropriated information about the acquisition. He abused the position of trust and confidence with the director and bought more than $1.3 million of Neff stock during the six weeks before the announcement &#8212; much of it while he was on a family vacation with the director. According to the complaint, he used a client trust fund account to fund some of the purchases. Following the acquisition, Borell sold his Neff stock for a profit of nearly $975,000.  The complaint charges each of the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties and an officer and director bar against Acord.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, alleges that between June 2016 and April 2017, Quality Companies, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold more than a thousand trucks to a third-party entity at inflated prices, which resulted in significant losses on the company's financial statements. The complaint further alleged that, as a result of the fraudulent scheme, quality sold the trucks at a steep loss, resulting in a loss of at least $1.5 million for Quality. Quality then transferred the truck sales to an off-book entity that had been purchased at the inflated values, and the resulting income statement impact was expected to be greater than previously reported. In addition, in some instances Quality sold these trucks for even greater profits than the value it had paid for them. As the complaint alleges, after the sale of those trucks was publicly reported on, it was forced to restate its financial results and file false financials for public consumption with the SEC. To settle the Commission's charges and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $100,000 and a civil penalty of a total of approximately $2.2 million, both of which will be deemed satisfied by the restitution ordered against Quality in its civil action.Â  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter and thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

In a complaint filed in federal court in Indianapolis, the SEC charged that between mid-2016 and April 2017, Celadon avoided recognizing at least $20 million in impairment charges and losses - almost two-thirds of its 2016 pre-tax income - by selling and buying used trucks at inflated prices from third parties. According to the complaint, as a result of the alleged scheme, Celadon overstated its pre-tax and net income and earnings per share in its annual report for the period ending June 30, 2016, and in its subsequent public filings for the first two fiscal quarters of 2017.  The SEC's complaint charges Celadon with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 thereunder and the books and records and reporting provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

James Thomas Webb, CitiRise Redevelopment, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company, and Alpine Properties, Inc., Relief Defendants, M.C. 07-Civ-6393 (JSR) (Spartan, N.D. Fla.)  SEC Files Settled Charges Against Florida Man for Operating a Multi-Million Dollar Real Estate Investment Scheme  On September 29, the Securities &amp; Exchange Act (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charging a Florida man with operating a multi-million dollar real estate investment scheme that defrauded more than 80 investors.  According to the Complaint, since at least 2002, James ""Webb"" Webb and his entities, Alpine, which he owns and controls, have raised approximately $8.4 million from investors through the sale of ""distressed"" residential property in low-income neighborhoods in several states. Webb routinely commingled investor funds in his corporate accounts and, as a result, it also appears that the Defendants paid some investor returns using funds contributed from other investors, despite the fact that many investors lost some or all of their original investments. To solicit investors to invest, Webb falsely represented to investors that they would receive substantial annual returns ranging from 20% to 114% per transaction, with the prospect of multiple transactions per year, when Webb had no reasonable basis for stating that he could generate such returns. Instead, according to Webb's wife, Shalola Sloan Webb (collectively, ""Sloan Webb""), Webb used investor money to pay for personal expenses, such as paying for leases on exotic cars and recreation travel. The Commission alleges that Webb also commedled and misused some of the investors' funds for his own personal use, including to purchase and renovate dilapidated properties worth far less than their initial investments and to support his fraudulent scheme. In a parallel action, on September 27, 2006, U. S. District Judge James B.

In its filing, the Commission sought, on an emergency basis, a court order freezing the defendants' and relief defendants' assets during the pendency of the case and an order requiring the defendants and relief defendants to provide a verified accounting for, among other things, the receipt and disbursement of all investor funds. The court entered the emergency Order today granting this relief and set an initial hearing date of November 26, 2007.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, since 2002, Webb and companies he owns and controls, CitiRise Redevelopment, LLC (a North Carolina limited liability company), CitiRise Redevelopment, LLC (a Florida limited liability company) (collectively, ""Citirise""), Progressive Redevelopment, LLC (""Progressive""), and Alpine Properties, LLC (""Alpine""), solicited investors to invest in a real estate scheme. According to the complaint, investors typically were asked to invest a minimum of $40,000 in the investment contracts. The Commission alleges that Webb and his companies falsely represented to investors that, in exchange for their investment, the defendants would generate substantial investment returns through the purchase, renovation and resale of ""distressed"" residential real estate in various locations including North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri and Tennessee. Instead, according to the complaint, Webb routinely used investor funds for his own purposes, including to fund his personal bank accounts and to pay for personal expenses, such as leases on exotic cars and recreation travel. The Commission's complaint also names as relief defendants Webb's wife, Sharon Sloan-Webb, and two other entities owned or controlled by Webb and/or his wife, Majestic Redevelopment, LLC and Webb Builders LLC. According to the complaint, the relief defendants controlled bank accounts that received investors' funds.  The complaint further alleges that defendants commingled investor funds and misrepresented that: (1) investors with Alpine, between 2002 and 2004, would receive monthly or bi-monthly returns, ranging from 20% to 114% per year, even though these returns were not paid as promised; (2) investors with CitiRise and Progressive, from approximately mid-2004, would receive substantial returns of at least 12.5% per transaction, with the prospect of multiple transactions per year, when (i) Webb, CitiRise and Progressive had no reasonable basis for stating that they could generate such returns, (ii) Webb, individually and through Alpine, had a history of defaulting on similarly promised returns, and (iii) in fact, such returns were not paid. According to the complaint, the defendants also misrepresented that each investor's money would be used for purchasing, refurbishing, and developing the property named in the investment contract, when in reality money was not used to improve the properties as promised. Moreover, the Commission alleges that, since at least mid-2004, the defendants falsely represented that each investment was, in form or in substance, an ""all encompassing"" or ""turn-key"" investment, such that investors understood their initial investment would cover the entirety of the projected costs and efforts of the transaction; in reality, Webb failed to complete property renovations and failed to sell or manage the properties as promised, leaving investors responsible for various ownership costs and to their own devices to try to sell unrenovated properties.  The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. In addition to emergency relief, the Commission's complaint seeks a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating these provisions of the securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

440,"On December 6, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York charging two individuals and their companies with securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least January 2014 to September 2015, James A. Cohen, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, and his company, Centra Financial Services, Inc. (""Centra""), engaged in a series of fraudulent transactions to defraud investors, many of whom were senior citizens. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the issuers' offering of securities, including the issuance of promissory notes to investors and the sale of unregistered brokerage accounts. In addition, defendants allegedly misrepresented the amount of investor funds they raised from investors by falsely telling investors that their money would be used for legitimate business purposes, when in fact the money was actually used to pay for personal expenses for Cohen's wife and two other companies.Â   The SEC alleges in its complaint that Cohen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Cohen consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $25,000, for a total of over $1.2 million, which will be deemed satisfied by the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations by Cohen and a cease-and-desist order for which Cohen agreed to be enjoined from participating in any offering or sales of any security, investment, municipal bond, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization (registration required).  In a parallel action, on December 5, 2016, in federal district court in Manhattan, Judge James B. Currid entered a temporary restraining order against Cohen from further violations, ordering him to disgorge $10,865,979, plus interest thereon, imposing a $20,500 civil penalty and imposing an officer and director bar against all defendants and any penny stock bar in violation of Sections 5(d), 5 (a), 13(c), and 16(e)(3) respectively, of which the Court will hold a hearing on the Commission's","The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against a Florida man who allegedly bought stock in the biotechnology company where his sibling worked based on confidential drug trial information misappropriated from the sibling.  According to the SEC's complaint, Stephen J. Leonard, a resident of Palm Harbor, Florida, made $107,000 in illicit profits by trading in the stock of Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a California-based biotechnology company where his sibling worked in a senior position, before Puma announced positive clinical trial results for its cancer drug.  As alleged in the complaint, from May 11 through July 18, 2014, Leonard and his sibling had four telephone conversations.  During those conversations, the sibling allegedly shared material, nonpublic information about Puma's drug trial with Leonard, trusting and expecting that he would keep the information confidential.  But, after each conversation, Leonard bought Puma stock based on material, non-public information, breaching a duty of trust and confidence to his sibling.  Leonard's final purchases of Puma stock were made on July 22, 2014, just hours before Puma publicly announced the positive results from its drug trial.  After the announcement, Puma's stock price nearly quadrupled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges Leonard with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Leonard consented to the entry of a final judgment that provides permanent injunctive relief under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and orders him to pay $107,000 in disgorgement, $11,996.86 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $107,000, for a total of $225,996.86.

Sonja Anticevic, David Pajcin, Eugene Plotkin, Stanislav Shpigelman, Nickolaus Shuster, Juan C. Renteria, Jr. and Henry Siegel, et al., United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 05 CV 6991 (KMW)  SEC CHARGES TWO FORMER GLOBAL LYNCH EXECUTIVES WITH INSIDER TRADING  On August 2, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Manhattan charging two former Goldman Sachs analysts with insider trading in connection with at least $6.7 million of illicit gains in the securities of several public companies. The SEC's complaint alleges that the two individuals engaged in a multi-year scheme to obtain non-public information from a variety of sources, including investment banks and financial publications. According to the complaint, beginning in late 2004, they developed, organized, and participated in two separate insider-trading schemes in which they traded on the basis of confidential information obtained from the Merrill Lynch and Business Week Schemes. In the first scheme, according to SEC filings, defendants sought to profit by obtaining confidential nonpublic details about deals that were being handled by the firms, such as mergers and acquisitions, from an account in their name at a bank in Salzburg, Austria, which was the executing broker for one of the deals. After obtaining the confidential details through an online job advertisement, Defendants then used the information to trade in Reebok International Ltd., Eon Labs, Inc., Cinergy Corp., The Gillette Company, The Coca-Cola Company and Celgene Corp. (collectively, ""Reebok"") and the ""Inside Wall Street"" column. As a result of their efforts to gain access to this information through the false postings in various press releases and in an e-mail sent to his employer, Ponzi-like payments to certain individuals residing in Europe, as well as to other individuals, some of whom were also involved in this scheme. Finally, in one instance, a European citizen tipped his father-in-law, who was also a trader at the same bank, about a series of deals involving the publication of a periodical article in The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No.  19650 / April 11, 2006  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Sonja Anticevic et al., 05 Civ. 6991 (KMW) (S.D.N.Y.)  SEC COMPLAINT CHARGES INTERNATIONAL INSIDER TRADING RING INCLUDING PERSONNEL AT MERRILL LYNCH AND GOLDMAN SACHS  On April 11, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission sought leave to file a second amended complaint (&#8220;Complaint&#8221;) in its pending action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging insider trading in advance of the August 3, 2005, announcement (&#8220;Announcement&#8221;) by Reebok International Ltd. (&#8220;Reebok&#8221;) that it had agreed to be acquired by adidas-Salomon AG (&#8220;Adidas&#8221;).  The Complaint alleges widespread and brazen international schemes of serial insider trading orchestrated by two individuals &#8212; Eugene Plotkin (&#8220;Plotkin&#8221;), a research analyst in the Fixed Income division of Goldman Sachs Group (&#8220;Goldman Sachs&#8221;), and David Pajcin (&#8220;Pajcin&#8221;), a former employee of Goldman Sachs &#8212; that yielded at least $6.7 million of illicit gains.  In one scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin persuaded a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (&#8220;Merrill Lynch&#8221;) to provide tips on upcoming mergers in return for a share of the trading profits.  In another scheme, Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals to obtain jobs at a printing plant in Wisconsin, steal advance copies of Business Week magazine and tip Plotkin and Pajcin on the names of companies discussed favorably in the &#8220;Inside Wall Street&#8221; (&#8220;IWS&#8221;) column before the magazine became public.  Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the inside information, initially in an account in Pajcin&#8217;s name and later, in accounts in the names of others in Europe and the United States.  Plotkin and Pajcin also tipped several individuals in the United States and Europe in return for a share of their trading profits.    In total, Plotkin and Pajcin traded in at least 25 stocks within one year based on inside information obtained through these schemes.  The Commission&#8217;s Complaint charges 13 individuals in the United States and Europe for their roles in the schemes.  This Complaint follows two prior complaints filed by the Commission in August 2005, charging insider trading in Reebok securities and successfully freezing over $6 million in trading proceeds.    In its initial filing in this matter, on August 5, 2005, the Commission obtained a court order freezing a securities account in the name of Sonja Anticevic (&#8220;Anticevic&#8221;), a Croatian national and resident.  The Anticevic account engaged in a series of highly profitable trades in &#8220;out of the money&#8221; call options of Reebok just prior to Reebok&#8217;s Announcement.  On August 18, 2005, the Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Anticevic which, among other relief, continues the asset freeze.    On August 18, 2005, the Commission also filed an amended complaint seeking additional emergency relief against eight additional defendants, including residents of the United States, Croatia and Germany, trading through several domestic and off-shore accounts.  As alleged in the amended complaint, the defendants acted in concert or under a common direction in placing the Reebok trades, and collectively netted a profit of over $6 million. Among others, the amended complaint charged Pajcin, who is Anticevic&#8217;s nephew, alleging that Pajcin placed or directed some of the Reebok trades, and tipped other defendants who placed Reebok trades.  Also charged were Henry Siegel, a resident of Pomona, New York; Monika Vujovic, a resident of New York, New York; Elvis Santana, a resident of Brooklyn, New York; Zoran Sormaz, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia; Perica Lopandic, a resident of Reinbek, Germany; Ilija Borac, a resident of Zagreb, Croatia; and Certain Unknown Persons trading in an account at an Austrian broker, Direktanlage.at AG (the &#8220;Direktanlage Traders&#8221;).    Acting on the Commission's request for emergency relief, the Court issued temporary restraining orders which, among other things, froze the proceeds of trading in Reebok securities in the domestic accounts and required the repatriation and freezing of the proceeds in the foreign accounts.  Ultimately, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against all of the defendants, and, as a result, the Commission obtained Court orders freezing over $6 million in illegal profits stemming from insider trading in Reebok securities.    The Commission&#8217;s Complaint, today, alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin explored a variety of audacious insider-trading schemes.  Among others, Plotkin and Pajcin met with a series of individuals employed at various investment banks in an attempt to get them to provide non-public information about deals those banks were handling.  Plotkin and Pajcin also contemplated various schemes involving exotic dancers, including having them garner information from bankers while dancing, and using them to induce investment bankers to provide Plotkin and Pajcin with information.  At least two schemes were consummated:    The Merrill Lynch Scheme  The Complaint alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin infiltrated the investment banking unit of Merrill Lynch, repeatedly learning of mergers and acquisitions transactions before they became public.  In exchange for a share of the illegal profits, Stanislav Shpigelman (&#8220;Shpigelman&#8221;), an analyst at Merrill Lynch, leaked confidential information to defendants Plotkin and Pajcin concerning at least six mergers or acquisitions that Merrill Lynch was working on, prior to the time the deals became public, including deals between (i) The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company and The Gillette Company; (ii) Novartis AG and Eon Labs, Inc.; (iii) Duke Energy and Cinergy Corp.; (iv) Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and LabOne, Inc.; (v) Celgene Corp. and a company considering acquiring Celgene; and (vi) Reebok and Adidas.  Plotkin and Pajcin traded on the insider information and passed the insider information on to individuals in the United States and Europe (&#8220;Traders&#8221;) who traded on it.  Plotkin and Pajcin had an agreement with the Traders, pursuant to which they were to receive a percentage of the illicit profits made by the Traders.  The Merrill Lynch Scheme yielded over $6.4 million in illicit trading profits.    The Business Week Scheme  The Complaint further alleges that Plotkin and Pajcin also infiltrated one of the printing plants utilized by Business Week, repeatedly obtaining advance copies of the market-moving IWS column in Business Week.  Plotkin and Pajcin recruited two individuals &#8212; first, Nickolaus Shuster (&#8220;Shuster&#8221;), and later Juan C. Renteria, Jr. (&#8220;Renteria&#8221;) &#8212; to obtain employment at Quad/Graphics, Inc., one of four printing plants that print Business Week magazine, for the sole purpose of stealing copies of upcoming editions of the magazine, and calling Plotkin or Pajcin to read them key portions of IWS &#8212; a widely-read column in the magazine that generally moves the price of the securities of companies mentioned in it &#8211; prior to the time the column became available to the public.  The Complaint alleges that Shuster and Renteria provided Plotkin or Pajcin with insider information concerning at least twenty companies that were featured in the IWS column.  Plotkin and Pajcin then either traded on the IWS insider information or passed the information to some or all of the Traders, who traded on the insider information.  The Business Week Scheme yielded over $345,000 in illicit trading profits.    The Commission&#8217;s Complaint names 5 new defendants &#8212; Plotkin, Shpigelman, Shuster, Renteria, and Mikhail Plotkin.

Sean David Morton, et al., Civil Action No.: 10-CV-1039 (SAS) (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES SEAN DAVID MORTON, VJRA PRODUCTIONS, LLC, and MAGIC EIGHT BALL DISTRIBUTING, INC. WITH FRAUD  On September 27, the Securities &amputations Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging a nationally-recognized psychic with defrauding more than 100 investors by falsely claiming that he would use their funds to trade in foreign currencies and distribute the trading profits among the investors.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that from the summer of 2006 to the end of 2007, Sean Morton solicited investors through his monthly newsletter, The Delphi Associates Newsletter and his website, www.delphiassociates.org. Morton enticed investors with a newsletter that described the three investment vehicles:  Vajra, for investments of $5,000 - $25,00; 27 Investments, $50;000; and Magic Eight Ball, Inc. (the ""Entities""), which were shell companies controlled by Morton and/or his wife, Melissa Morton. The complaint further alleges Morton lied to investors about his past successes, his use of investor funds and the illiquidity of the funds; falsely claimed that the investments were audited and certified; Morton also falsely told investors that their money would be used ""EXCLUSELY"" for foreign currency trading; that Morton would ""generally transfer"" the money to other entities, including a nonprofit religious organization, PRJ, a charitable organization set up and owned by the Mortons. In reality, Morton did not invest any of these funds as promised; instead, instead of using the pooled funds for trading, he diverted at least $3.2 million of investors' money into his own charitable foundation, which he used to pay for his personal expenses, such as rent and a mortgage, or to purchase a home for himself and to make payments to his children.

Sean David Morton, Vajra Productions, LLC, 27 Investments, LLC, and Magic Eight Ball Distributing, Inc., defendants, and Melissa Morton and Prophecy Research Institute, relief defendants, Civil Action No. 10-CV-1720 (SDNY) (DC)SEC Charges Nationally Known Psychic in Multi-Million Dollar Offering FraudOn March 4, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Sean David Morton, a nationally-recognized psychic who bills himself as âAmericaâs Prophet,â and three corporate entities that Morton co-owns, for engaging in a multi-million dollar offering fraud. Â Beginning in or around the summer of 2006, Morton solicited individuals to invest in one of several companies he and his wife, Melissa Morton, controlled â defendants Vajra Productions, LLC, 27 Investments, LLC, and Magic Eight Ball Distributing, Inc. (referred to herein as the Entities and, along with Morton, referred to as the Defendants) â under the umbrella of the Delphi Associates Investment Group (Delphi Investment Group). Â According to the Commissionâs complaint, in soliciting these individuals, Morton claimed that he would use his psychic expertise to provide investment guidance to his investing team, and he falsely touted his historical success in psychically predicting the various rises and falls of the market. Â Morton further claimed that he would use the pooled funds to trade in foreign currencies and distribute pro rata the trading profits among the investors. Â However, according to the complaint, Morton lied to investors about his past successes, and about key aspects of the Delphi Investment Group, including the use of investor funds and the liquidity of the funds, and that the profits in the accounts were audited and certified. Â All together, Morton fraudulently raised more than $6 million from more than 100 investors for the Delphi Investment Group. Â According to the Commissionâs complaint, Morton used his monthly newsletter, his website, his appearances on a nationally syndicated radio show called Coast to Coast AM, and appearances at public events, to promote his psychic abilities. Â Morton made numerous materially false representations relating to his psychic abilities in order to solicit investors for the Delphi Investment Group. Â For example, Morton wrote to potential investors in his July 20, 2006 newsletter that: âI have called ALL the highs and lows of the market, giving EXACT DATES for rises and crashes over the last 14 years.â Â (emphasis in original.) Â The Commission alleges that this assertion, like others Morton made in soliciting investors, is false.Further, according to the complaint, Morton, who did not seek accreditation status from the Delphi Investment Group investors, placed investor funds in the bank accounts of one of the Entities, and that Morton and/or Melissa Morton, commingled the investorsâ funds among the Entitiesâ accounts. Â Additionally, according to the complaint, while Morton promised investors that all of their funds would be used to trade foreign currencies, in fact, he invested only about half of the funds with foreign currency trading firms. Â Unbeknownst to the investors, instead of investing all of the funds into foreign currency trading firms, Morton, and/or Melissa Morton, diverted some of the investor funds. Â For instance, the Mortons diverted at least $240,000 of investor funds to their own nonprofit religious organization, Prophecy Research Institute (PRI). Â Melissa Morton and PRI are named as relief defendants (Relief Defendants) in the complaint.The Commissionâs complaint charges each of the Defendants with violations of Â Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Â The complaint further charges that the Relief Defendants were unjustly enriched by receiving investor funds. Â The complaint seeks a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining the Defendants from future violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws. Â The complaint further seeks a final judgment ordering the Defendants, jointly and severally, to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, ordering the Relief Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties. Â The complaint also seeks a final judgment ordering the Defendants and Relief Defendants to provide a verified accounting.

The Commission's complaint alleges that, from July 2006 to November 2006, defendants repeatedly intruded into the account of at least thirteen foreign investors and placed unauthorized buy orders at prices well above the current market prices for fourteen securities. The intrusions created the appearance of legitimate trading activity and pumped up the prices of the fourteen stocks. In the fifteen trading days leading up to the intrusion, Defendants realized unlawful trading profits of more than $6,500. Online broker-dealers whose customers' accounts were compromised suffered losses of over $875,000 as a result of these fraudulent transactions. According to SEC Complaint in this matter:   Defendants began to intrude into these accounts on September 20, at approximately 3:45 PM EDT, by placing unauthorized buys of securities in their own accounts using the stolen passwords and Internet protocol addresses assigned to Internet service providers (ISPs) located in Thailand and India. Immediately or shortly thereafter, one or more of Defendants executed these unauthorized purchases using computers and other Internet-based services. Then, beginning at 2:51:38 AM EDT on the same day, they entered into a second TD Ameritrade account and made unauthorized purchase orders of shares of IGI, Inc., Earth Products &amp; Technologies Inc.

SEC Sues Three Offshore Hackers With Scheme to Intrude Into Online Accounts, Manipulate Market    The United States Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska charging three Indian nationals with participating in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the prices of at least fourteen securities through the unauthorized use of other people's online brokerage accounts.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, between July and November 2006, Jaisankar Marimuthu, Chockalingam Ramanathan and Thirugnanam Ramanathan hijacked the online brokerage accounts of unwitting investors using stolen usernames and passwords. Prior to intruding into these accounts, the Defendants acquired positions in the securities of at least thirteen issuers and options on shares of another issuer. Then, without the account holders' knowledge, and using the victims' own accounts and funds, the Defendants placed scores of unauthorized buy orders at above-market prices. After these unauthorized buy orders were placed, the Defendants sold the positions held in their own accounts at the artificially inflated prices. These transactions created the appearance of legitimate trading activity and pumped up the share price of the fourteen securities. The complaint further alleges that on several occasions, the Defendants opened new online brokerage accounts using stolen personal information, and then funded these accounts using hundreds of thousands of dollars taken from the account holders' own bank accounts.  In total, the Defendants realized unlawful trading profits of at least $121,500. Online broker-dealers whose customers' accounts were compromised suffered losses of least of $875,000 as a result of the Defendants' fraudulent conduct.

In a related action, a federal court in Nebraska today unsealed a twenty-three count indictment charging both Marimuthu and Chockalingam Ramanathan with one count of conspiracy, eight counts of computer fraud, six counts of wire fraud, two counts of securities fraud, and six counts of aggravated identity theft. The indictment also charges Thirugnanam Ramanathan with one count of conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, and two counts of aggravated identity theft. The conspiracy and computer fraud charges each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Wire fraud and securities fraud carry maximum sentences of twenty and twenty-five years, respectively. Each count of aggravated identity theft adds two years in prison, with at least one of those terms running consecutively with the sentences for the other charges. The indictment resulted from an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Nebraska, and the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property and Fraud Sections of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice. The government will seek the extradition of the arrested Defendants to face charges in Nebraska.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that between September 2013 and July 2016, Lewis, through his company, Reamcher, LLC, raised approximately $35 million from approximately 250 investors nationwide through the fraudulent offerings of Aegis Oil and Gas and 7S Oil & Gas, Inc. (Aegis).  Lewis worked at different times as a train sales team and also worked as the liaison between the sales offices and the broker-dealer operator for both offerings, and he assisted with sales calls with investors by answering questions and providing information about the oil well projects. The complaint further alleges Lewis received commissions ranging from 20% to 35% on all investor proceeds raised, also out of investor money, from sales agents. According to the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order and an order directing Lewis to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is equal to his disgorgement of ill gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, as well as civil money penalties. Lewis has agreed to settle the matter without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to a permanent injunction from future violations of Sections 5(a) and (c), and from aiding and abetting any violations by Lewis or any other person. In a parallel action, on August 12, 2020, a federal district court in Orlando, Florida entered a preliminary injunction against Lewis from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(e)(1). The court also entered an administrative order freezing Lewis's assets and prohibiting him from participating in any offering of securities other than those of a registered broker or dealer. Without granting the emergency relief requested by the SEC, in a separate administrative proceeding, entered the same day Lewis pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and cooperated with the FBI in its investigation of this matter. On August 16, 2019, Judge James O. Gonzales entered final judgments enjoining Lewis and other defendants from further violations, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined at a later time, by a court hearing on whether the amount of restitution should be deemed satisfied by restitution ordered against the defendants and a restitution order entered against him by an SEC administrative staff. Also on","On August 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Chad Anthony Lewis, a Kentucky resident for unlawfully acting as an unregistered broker and selling unregistered investments in two oil and gas companies based in Texas.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Lewis illegally solicited and raised money from investors for Aegis Oil, LLC and 7S Oil & Gas, LLC.  Both of these companies offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of ""joint venture units"" in oil and gas development projects located in Texas.  According to the SEC's complaint, Lewis, who worked at different times both for Aegis and 7S, helped train a network of sales agents that unlawfully solicited investments for Aegis and 7S and assisted agents in closing sales calls with investors.  The SEC alleges that Lewis directly solicited at least one investor, who purchased investments in both Aegis and 7S.  Lewis was paid transaction-based compensation in the form of a sales commission of 2% on all investor proceeds raised through the offerings.  He also received commissions ranging from 20% to 31% from the proceeds of the investments he sold to one investor.  In total, Lewis received about $374,000 in commission payments from the Aegis offerings and $250,700 from the 7S offerings.

Prudential Financial, Inc., United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Civil Action No.: 09-CV-1128 DOC (D.N.J.)  SEC CHARGES PRUDENTIAL FOR MISAPPROPRIATING OVER $200 MILLION IN INJUNCTIONS  On March 20, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Newark, N. J., charging Prudence Financial Inc. with violating the financial reporting, books-and-records and internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission's complaint alleges that from December 1997 through December 2002, Prupac Insurance Corporation, a publicly-traded reinsurer, entered into a series of so-called finite reinsurance contracts with General Reinsurance Corporation (""Gen Re"") that had no economic substance and no purpose other than to build up and then draw down on an off-balance sheet asset, or ""bank,"" that Gen Re held for P.R.P. Genre, an entity controlled by Pupac, sold personal lines of property and casualty insurance in the retail market. According to the complaint, from 1997 to 2000, GenRe, through its subsidiaries and affiliates in which it was a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, engaged in an arrangement with GenR to acquire reinsurances contracts that were structured to provide for a ""finite bank,"" or, in this case, to offset losses in future periods from the company's exposure to loss. These contracts were designed to be riskless, written to look like a &#8220;bank&#8221; but were not to meet the requirements of GAAP. In addition, each contract was designed with the intent of providing a means to cover up to $50 million in losses, and the other contracts had the same risk of loss as the promised profits. As a result of this round-trip arrangement, both GenRE and Prampac overstated their net income for 2000 by $57 million or 9%, or $75 million and 25%, respectively. By the end of 1998, Pruneac had become a public company and its financial statements became a part of its annual, quarterly and current filings thereafter.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20670 / August 6, 2008  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Prudential Financial, Inc., 08 Civ. 3916 (PGS) (D.N.J.)  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2860 / August 6, 2008  Prudential Financial, Inc. Settles Financial Reporting and Related Charges by SEC for Improperly Reporting Over $200 Million in Income as a Result of Purported Reinsurance Contracts  On August 6, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging Prudential Financial, Inc., a leading provider of financial services, with violating the financial reporting, books-and-records, and internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential has agreed to settle the case, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, alleges that from December 1997 through December 2002, Prudential's former property and casualty subsidiaries known as the Prupac companies (""Prupac""), entered into a series of so-called finite reinsurance contracts with General Reinsurance Corporation (""Gen Re"") that had no economic substance and no purpose other than to build up and then draw down on an off-balance sheet asset, or ""bank,"" that Gen Re held for Prupac. According to the complaint, the contracts were shams, written to look like they met the requirements to qualify for reinsurance accounting; in fact, they were subject to an oral side agreement that effectively eliminated any risk to either party and made such accounting improper. Prupac built up the bank in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and then, in 2000, 2001 and 2002, drew down on the bank and improperly recorded the repayments as income. In 2001, Prudential became a public company and the inaccurate financial statements became a part of its annual, quarterly and current filings thereafter.  The complaint alleges that the improper accounting practices began in 1997, when Prudential and Gen Re negotiated a riskless reinsurance contract under which Prupac paid Gen Re $50 million. The contract was entered into in the final days of the coverage period, but backdated to appear as if it had been agreed to before the coverage period began. The understanding between the parties was that Gen Re would credit Prupac with interest at the one-year Treasury bill rate and also collect a fee on the money it held. It was further agreed that the relationship would be riskless: If Gen Re lost money in the early years of the relationship, when its exposure on the purported reinsurance contracts was greater than the amount in the bank, Prupac would make Gen Re whole. The parties kept track of where they stood in the relationship by means of a ledger, called an ""Experience Account Balance,"" which showed payments made into the bank, less fees, plus interest, and less payments out.  From 1997 through 2000, Prupac built up the bank, depositing approximately $190 million of the $200 million it would eventually deposit with Gen Re in the form of premiums on reinsurance policies for which no reinsurance recoveries were triggered. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, Prupac drew down on the bank, structuring the purported reinsurance contracts to ensure it recovered virtually to the penny every payment it had made, plus interest, less Gen Re's fee. As a result of these recoveries, Prudential improperly reported additional pre-tax income of $97 million, $80 million and $41 million in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.  The complaint alleges that the improper accounting practices within Prudential's Property and Casualty Insurance division resulted in an overstatement of Prudential's consolidated pre-tax income for 2000, 2001 and 2002 by $57 million or 9%, $75 million or 25%, and by $38 million or 146%, respectively. As a result of these improper accounting practices, Prudential filed annual, quarterly and current reports with the Commission that included financial statements that were inaccurate and misleading and violated the financial reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Prudential violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Prudential has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.

Bankosky, Case No.: 11-CV-1079 (SDNY)  SEC Charges Former Director of Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. With Insider Trading  The Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act;) announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging a former director of a biotechnology company with insider trading in advance of two corporate announcements: (1) the March 31, 2008 post-close public announcement that a Japanese pharmaceutical company had formed a strategic alliance with Cell Genesys, and (2) on April 10, 2009, the April 2010 announcement concerning a cash tender offer for Millennium, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, Brent ""Buddy"" Banko, 41, of Deerfield, Illinois, was a director in a business development group at the time of the company's acquisition of Millennium. The complaint alleges that, during the course of his work as a Director in this group, Bankozky obtained material, non-public information (""inside information"") in three separate transactions involving the merger of three pharmaceutical companies - CellGenomics Inc., Amag Pharmaceutical Inc and AMAG Pharmaceutical - that were engaged in confidential discussions with Millennium in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In the first transaction, bankozoned out-of-the-money call options in Millennium on March 29, 2010. After the acquisition was announced, Millennium's stock price rose 31 percent, from $2.35 to $24.34, an increase of 48.87%. The second transaction involved a $40,000 ""call option"" option that allowed the purchaser to buy 100 shares of Millennium stock for $15.00 per share before the call option expired.

Bankosky, Civil Action No. 12-Civ-1012 (HB)  On February 9, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that a former employee of Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. traded on inside information about the Japanese firm's business alliances and corporate acquisitions.  Brent Bankosky, a former Senior Director in Takeda's U.S.-based business development group, has agreed to pay more than $136,000 to settle the SEC's charges. The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of Judge Harold Baer, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Under the proposed settlement, the Court, upon motion by the Commission, will determine whether to impose an officer-and-director bar against Bankosky.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Bankosky reaped more than $63,000 of profits, achieving a 169% rate of return, by trading on non-public information about two business transactions in 2008. Takeda's business development group worked on the transactions, a strategic alliance with Cell Genesys, Inc., and the acquisition of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which were referred to internally by their code names, Project Ceres and Project Mercury. Bankosky's trading violated U.S. securities laws and Takeda's policies, which forbade employees from disclosing or trading based on inside information.  According to the SEC's complaint, almost immediately after Bankosky joined Takeda in January 2008 as a Director in its business development group, he began to misuse confidential corporate information for his personal benefit. In February 2008, Bankosky began placing trades in his personal brokerage account based on non-public information about Takeda's proposed strategic alliance with Cell Genesys, which was announced in March. Starting in March 2008, Bankosky made additional trades for his own account based on non-public information about Takeda's plan to acquire Millennium, which was announced in April. Bankosky also traded on other confidential information in 2009 and 2010, purchasing call options in the securities of Arena Pharmaceutical, Inc., and AMAG Pharmaceutical, Inc., respectively, when the firms were engaged in confidential discussions on business transactions with Takeda. Bankosky, who was promoted to Senior Director of Takeda's business development group in September 2010, resigned from Takeda in May 2011.  The SEC's complaint charges Bankosky with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, as well as Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3. The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Bankosky to pay a financial penalty and disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, preventing him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and permanently enjoining him from future violations of those provisions of the federal securities laws.   # # #   SEC Complaint in this matter   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2012/lr22255.htm     Home | Previous Page  Modified: 02/13/2012",0.6128,0.5134

Turkcan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (E.D. Mo.  Case Number 4:09-cv-00204)  SEC CHARGES FORMER PRESIDENT OF FIRST BANK MORTGAGE WITH MISAPPROPRIATION SCHEME   The Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the U. S. Department of Justice, Eastern Division, alleging that Mark ""Turkcan,"" the former President of First Bank Mortgage (FBM), defrauded investors by engaging in a scheme to misstate the net income of FBM and its parent First Banks, Inc. by secretly obtaining money from third-party broker-dealers through the use of repurchase transactions, which are essentially collateralized loans, and improperly disguising the money obtained from those transactions as tradable gains (and more rare losses).  According to the Commission's complaint, in May 2008, shortly after being terminated for reasons unrelated to his scheme, the company discovered the scheme and that it owed approximately $35 million in liabilities under outstanding mortgage-backed securities as a result of the alleged misconduct. The complaint further alleges that in order to conceal the fact that the $5 million was a profit, he concealed the loss by falsifying and fabricating documents and providing false and misleading information to First B&Q's outside auditor, who was investigating the matter at the time. In a parallel action, on July 30, 2008 the SEC filed an enforcement action against First C.A. (the ""Complaint"") and First A.B. Bank (""First Bank""). The Complaint alleges the following:  From at least 1990 through April 2008 Turkank, a resident of Kirkwood, Missouri, was an officer and a director of a bank holding company that operated either as an investment bank or a branch of one of its subsidiaries. He served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1991 through his termination and as Executive Vice President from 1997 through 2008. From 1997 until his departure from the bank in 2004, Turkkan was the president and chief financial officer of Sheahan Financial (First Banks), which was then a subsidiary of Clayton Savings &amp; Loan Association (Clayton Savings) and the entity of which he was President.

Turkcan with Fraud  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri alleging that Mark T. Turkcan (""Turkcan""), the former President of First Bank Mortgage (""FBM""), defrauded investors by engaging in a scheme to misstate the net income of FBM and its parent First Banks, Inc. from at least 1990 through April 2008.  The Commission alleges that Turkcan, a resident of Kirkwood, Missouri, carried out his scheme by secretly obtaining money from third-party brokerage firms through the surreptitious use of repurchase transactions, which are essentially collateralized loans, and improperly disguising the money obtained from those transactions as gains from trading mortgage-backed securities. According to the complaint, Turkcan circumvented First Banks, Inc.'s internal controls and concealed his scheme by lying to his staff and his superiors, falsifying and fabricating documents, and providing false and misleading information to First Banks, Inc. and its outside auditor. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Turkcan fabricated trade tickets and confirmations and prepared a handwritten report each month that included fictitious trading gains, which he provided to his staff for entry into FBM's accounting system. The complaint also alleges that Turkcan created a register that included the fictitious trading gains and provided it to First Banks, Inc.'s outside auditor in connection with its annual audits of First Bank, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements.  The Commission further alleges that as a result of Turkcan's scheme, First Banks, Inc. incurred an undisclosed obligation of approximately $35 million and materially misstated its net income in filings with the Commission. The complaint alleges that as a result of Turkcan's scheme, First Banks, Inc. overstated its net income in its public filings by approximately: $5.3 million (or 10.2%) in 2007; $3.5 million (or 3.2%) in 2006; $1.4 million (or 1.5%) in 2005; and $1.3 million (or 1.6%) in 2004, and understated its net income by approximately $800,000 (or 1.3% in 2003).  On July 30, 2008, First Banks, Inc. restated its financial results for the years 2005 through 2007 and disclosed that it had discovered material misstatements in its financial statements arising out of the circumvention of established internal controls and material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting.  The Commission's complaint charges Turkcan with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil penalties, prejudgment interest, and an officer and director bar.

SEC CHARGES MATTHEW CARLEY WITH FRAUD IN THE OFFERING AND DUMPING OF ASSETS   The Securities &amp; ExchangeCommission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Matthew C. ""Matthew"" Carter, age 44, of Bozeman, Montana, and his company, Red Branch Technologies, Inc. (""Red Branch""), for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price and volume of shares of an issuer's stock. The Commission's complaint alleges that, beginning in June 2009, Carter gained control of a substantial portion of the outstanding outstanding shares and, after positioning his stock for immediate sale, orchestrated two ""blast email"" campaigns that he called &#8220;blast&#8221; campaigns. Both campaigns were disseminated to coincide with materially false and misleading company press releases which he also orchestrated. Carter immediately exploited these rises to sell more than 7 million shares, realizing $789,478 in unlawful profits. According to the complaint, the materials disseminating during these ""distorts"" included statements like,  &nbsp;  [Red branch] offers a unique set of security products for military and law enforcement purposes. [And] can deploy these solutions today. &  In fact, as carley well knew, red Branch had no genuine operations and could not actually deliver any services it promised. Neither of these statements was true. As a result of this conduct, both campaigns generated dramatic increases in red branch's share prices and trading volume. In addition to imposing a permanent injunction and requiring Carter to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,849,472, which is the amount of his ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment and interest-based compensation, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this action, all defendants have consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(d)(2)(A), and 13b2-1","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a penny stock promoter in Montana with orchestrating a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme involving the stock of a Northern Virginia-based company that claims to be in the airport security business.    The SEC alleges that Matthew Carley, who lives in Bozeman, Mont., engineered a reverse merger and gained control of free-trading shares of Red Branch Technologies located in Ashburn, Va.  Carley then orchestrated two blast e-mail campaigns promoting Red Branch stock, and he timed the e-mails to coincide with the dissemination of materially false and misleading company press releases touting technology related to airport security and homeland security.  However as Carley well knew, Red Branch had no true business operations and no sales revenue.  Once the promotional campaigns generated dramatic increases to Red Branch's share price and trading volume, Carley immediately sold several million Red Branch shares for $789,478 in unlawful profits.   Carley agreed to settle the SEC's charges and be barred from the penny stock industry.    The SEC's complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleges that Carley violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5.  A parallel criminal case against Carley was announced today by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Allcott, Civil Action No 1:20-cv-10027-MPK (District of Massachusetts)  SEC Charges Massachusetts-Based Investment Adviser and Two Its Principals With Fraudulent Securities Offering  On July 1, the Securities &amp; Exchange (Commission) filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Massachusetts against a Boston-based investment adviser and two of its principals.  The Commission's complaint alleges that, between July 2015 and January 2018, Thomas d.Renison, age 64, of South Glastonbury, Connecticut, and his co-founders, Timothy James Allcott, raised more than $6 million from at least fifteen investors, nearly all of whom are senior citizens. According to the complaint, all three defendants told investors that their money would be safe with ARO Equity, that the return on their investments was far superior to that of their current retirement products and that they would earn double-digit returns. The complaint further alleges the defendants' statements to investors were materially false and misleading. For example, in early 2017, when the fraud was uncovered by the Commission, they had collected nearly $580,000 in finder's fees from the firm based on the solicitation of investors and had received a total of approximately $1.4 million in compensation from all the investors. In addition, according to one investor who inherited a significant portion of her father's trust, she used investor funds to pay for her sons' college tuition and to support her husband's lifestyle. Finally, one of the investment advisory clients lost nearly a half-million dollars in principal when they were told their retirement funds were being used to fund a fictitious European casino. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, ALLcott consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of Securities Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, pay a penalty of $3.3 million and be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. He also agreed to be enjoined from participating in any offering, purchase, offer, or sale","The Securities and Exchange Commission charged MA-based private investment firm ARO Equity, LLC, and its principals, Thomas D. Renison and Timothy J. Allcott, with fraud.  As alleged, the defendants made false statements to current and prospective retail investors about ARO Equity's performance and used investor funds to pay interest to other investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, in July 2014, Renison, a CT resident, was barred by the SEC from, among other things, associating with any investment adviser or broker dealer.  Nevertheless, the complaint alleges that from at least July 2015 through June 2018, Renison violated this bar when he, along with Allcott, a MA-resident, formed ARO Equity and raised approximately $6 million from at least 15 investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Renison and Allcott falsely touted ARO Equity's success to encourage potential investors to cash out of their retirement products and invest with them in ARO Equity.  The complaint alleges that soon after the defendants launched the firm, ARO Equity's investments began to fail.  Rather than inform their investors of the losses, Renison and Allcott continued to falsely promote ARO Equity's success and the security of investing with them.   Among other false statements, Renison and Allcott allegedly told investors that ARO Equity had double-digit returns, that there was no downside to investing with the firm, and that the investors' money was as safe as being in a bank.  In reality, ARO Equity had experienced significant losses and had to use new investor funds to pay interest to older investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that ARO Equity, Renison, and Allcott violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint further alleges that Renison violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.  The Commission's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, conduct-based injunctions against Renison and Allcott, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an order from the Court requiring Renison to comply with the SEC's 2014 bar.

Genet, Civil Action No. 09-CV-4215 (E.D.N.Y.) (Seybert, J)  SEC Files Fraud Charges Against Jason M. Genet, Former Stock Promoter of China Energy Savings Technology, Inc.  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil action against Jason M. Genet of Phoenix, Arizona, alleging that Genet participated in an elaborate stock manipulation scheme involving China Energy Savings Technology, Inc., a now-defunct Nevada company with purported operations in China. In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Genet helped China Energy falsely obtain a listing on the Nasdaq National Market System (""NMS"") and entered into secret arrangements to give away China Energy stock to people who agreed to purchase China Energy stock in the market, thereby creating the false and misleading impression of bona fide and active investor interest in China Energy. The Complaint alleges that Genet acted in concert with Chiu Wing Chiu, a Chinese national who secretly controlled China Energy. The Commission previously sued Chiu and his associates for their conduct in the China Energy fraud.  Among other things, the Commission's Complaint alleges that Genet played a crucial role in the illegal ""pump and dump"" manipulation of the common stock of China Energy. According to the Complaint, as part of the manipulation, Genet: (i) helped China Energy falsely obtain a listing on the Nasdaq NMS by helping China Energy to give away shares to hundreds of persons, and thereby created the false and misleading impression that China Energy had a bona fide and active shareholder base; (ii) engaged in unregistered distributions of securities; and (iii) entered into secret arrangements to give away China Energy stock to persons who agreed to purchase China Energy stock in the market, and thereby created the false and misleading impression of active trading and interest in China Energy. In payment for his fraudulent activities, Genet received thousands of shares of China Energy stock, which he later sold into the artificially inflated market, realizing illicit profits in excess of $1.7 million.  The Commission's complaint charges Genet with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws (Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933). The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Genet prohibiting him from further violations of the securities laws, disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains, civil penalties and a penny stock bar.  The Commission previously filed fraud charges against China Energy, Chiu Wing Chiu, and several of Chiu's associates, seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, penalties, and other relief, as well as an order freezing $3.9 million in assets held in four U.S. brokerage accounts by nominees of Chiu. See Lit. Rel. 19933 (Dec. 4, 2006). On March 27, 2009, the court entered final judgments against Chiu, Lai Fun ""Stella"" Sim, Jun Tang Zhao, Sun Li, and New Solomon Consultants, finding them liable for fraud, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court also imposed officer-and-director bars against Chiu, Sim, Zhao, and Li. On July 31, 2009, the court entered a final judgment against the relief defendant nominees of Chiu, ordering that the $3.9 million still held in U.S. brokerage accounts be turned over as proceeds of the fraud.  For additional related actions by the Commission against China Energy, see Rel. 34-53839 (May 19, 2006) (suspending trading in China Energy stock); Rel. 34-54503A (Sept. 26, 2006) (imposing a second trading suspension in China Energy stock); Admin.

According to the SEC's complaint, from no later than February 2014 until July 27, 2018, One Global, a private, South Florida firm, used a network of sales agents to offer and sell securities to investors in no fewer than 42 states to fund its business of offering short-term cash advances to businesses that could not obtain more traditional financing. The complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented the value of investor accounts and the rate of return of the investors' funds, including misrepresenting the role of an accounting firm in the company's marketing materials and on investors&#8217; monthly account statements. As a result, investors were left with a false impression that their money was being used to pay for lavish personal expenses and funding the luxury life of its founder, Chairman and CEO, Carl Ruderman, who was also a financial advisor. In reality, according to The SEC, investor funds were used for purposes other than the cash advance and to finance the extravagant lifestyle of one of his relatives, his son, and unrelated businesses in which he had a beneficial interest. Investors were also told that ""cash to be deployed"" was included in investor brokerage statements and that investors could see on the monthly statements how much investor money had allegedly increased in value, which directly correlated with the rates of returns the statements told each investor he or she was earning on their investment.

The","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Savraj Gata-Aura and a company he controls, Core Agents Ltd., with aiding and abetting an investment scheme that defrauded investors of more than $30 million.  The SEC alleges that Gata-Aura, a New York resident, recruited a network of sales agents to sell fraudulent investments in co-working spaces Bar Works, Inc. and Bar Works 7th Avenue, Inc. using false and misleading offering materials.  The materials touted the background of Bar Works' purported CEO, ""Jonathan Black,"" and omitted any mention of Renwick Haddow, the actual individual controlling the entities.  According to the SEC's complaint, Gata-Aura knew that ""Black"" was a fictitious name for a person who did not exist, that Haddow secretly ran the Bar Works companies, and that Haddow had previously been sued in the United Kingdom by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority for an unrelated investment scheme.  The complaint further alleges that from September 2015 to June 2017, Gata-Aura and Core Agents raised over $10 million from at least 100 investors for the fraudulent investments.  As alleged, in return for their role in selling the fraudulent investments, Gata-Aura and Core Agents received commissions that totaled at least $2.9 million from Haddow and the Bar Works companies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Gata-Aura and Core Agents with aiding and abetting Haddow's and the Bar Works companies' violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

457,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Diana P. Lovera, the former Chief Operating Officer of Oxford City Football Club, Inc., a defunct sports team formerly located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to defraud more than 150 investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, from approximately September 2013 to May 2015, Defendant and others operated a classic boiler room scheme in which they sold millions of shares of stock through several fraudulent practices, including the use of a purported voice verification system. The complaint alleges that, as part of the scheme, defendant and her co-conspirators used high-pressure, strong-armed tactics to persuade prospective investors to invest. For example, they would dupe a prospective investor by claiming that they could ""lock-in"" a discounted price on Oxford city stock, and then convince them that the voice recording was a legally binding contract that goes into three levels of compliance including a ""federal filing"" with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As alleged in the complaint:   Defendant used ""boiler room"" tactics"" to intimidate and coerce individuals to purchase Oxfordcity stock.&nbsp;  The SEC alleges in its complaint that Defendant made numerous materially false and fraudulent statements to investors concerning, among other things: (1) the existence of an ""unregistered broker-dealer""; (2) OxfordCity owned $90 million worth of real estate; and (3) that it owned an online university that had 10,000 students enrolled and would soon generate over $100 million of revenue; (4) this defendant was the sole controlling officer of one of these companies. In a parallel action, on June 28, 2017, a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a temporary restraining order freezing Defendant's assets and prohibiting her from participating in any offering of penny stock until a hearing on the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendant has consented to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, an officer-and-director bar and an order barring Defendant from serving as a director of any public company or any investment company for at least five years, with a right to reapply after a five-year period of probation. Also today, Judge William J. Allen entered an emergency court order","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against the former Chief Operating Officer of a Florida-based penny stock company that falsely claimed to be ""the largest publicly traded diversified portfolio of professional sports teams in the world.""  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from approximately July 2013 to July 2015, Diana P. Lovera and others at Oxford City used pressure tactics and a boiler room of salespeople to raise approximately $6.6 million from more than 150 investors, many of whom were unaccredited, through the sale of millions of unregistered shares of Oxford City stock. The complaint alleges that, in connection with these unregistered stock offerings, Lovera made numerous misstatements to investors about Oxford City's assets, its business plan, its future profitability, and the composition of its management. The complaint further alleges that Lovera and others falsely told prospective investors they could ""lock in"" a discounted price on Oxford City stock using the company's ""voice verification system,"" which they claimed linked the investor's personal information to a filing with the SEC. In reality, the complaint alleges, there was no such voice verification system; Lovera and others merely pressed buttons on a telephone key pad to mimic a recording device.  Lovera was charged criminally in a parallel case. She pled guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and was sentenced to 20-month prison term, which she is now serving, and ordered to pay, jointly and severally with other defendants, approximately $6.31 million in restitution.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Lovera with violating Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. To settle the charges, Lovera agreed to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws; imposes a conduct-based injunction, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar; and orders her to pay disgorgement of $81,374 plus prejudgment interest of $3,343, which will be deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered against her in the criminal case. Lovera also consented to an SEC order imposing a permanent associational bar.  The SEC previously charged Oxford City and its former CEO, Thomas Anthony Guerriero, and a relief defendant owned by Guerriero. Earlier this year, the SEC obtained final judgments against Oxford City, Guerriero, and the relief defendant. Guerriero also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and was sentenced to a 12 1/2 year prison term.

Jerry Shaw-Yau Chang, Civil Action No C 04-4144 MHP (N.D. Cal.)  SEC Charges Clarent Corporation's Former CEO with Improper Reporting of $13 Million in Revenue   The Securities &amp; Market Abuse Unit (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Jerry ""Jack"" Chang (""Chang""). The Commission's complaint alleges that, during the 2000 fiscal year, Chang orally promised D-Link Corporation, a customer based in Taiwan, that if it placed an order for its product, it would arrange for a third-party customer to buy the product from the company. Chang's oral promise meant that the contract was fixed and determinable, when no significant contractual obligations or acceptance terms remained outstanding. The complaint further alleges Chang knew that he was not obligated to pay the customer, and therefore, he withheld information about the oral promises from D'Link's outside auditors. As a result of his misconduct, the Commission charged Chang with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in today's Commission complaint, Chang consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to disgorge $25 million in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and pay a $50,000 civil penalty; and prohibits Chang from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company and from participating in any transactions involving a public company or a publicly-traded company, except as a relief defendant in a settled administrative proceeding. In a parallel action, on September 5, 2005, Judge Paul G. Block, who entered a temporary restraining order against Chang and other defendants, issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) the antifraud and reporting provisions of Section 15(d)(2) in connection with the issuance of an accounting statement in which Chang was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations, including aiding and abetting any violation of those provisions and any future","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 18914 / September 30, 2004  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2117 / September 30, 2004  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v.  JERRY S. CHANG, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, No. C 04-4144 MHP  COMMISSION FILES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST FORMER CEO OF CLARENT CORPORATION  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has filed financial accounting fraud charges against the former Chief Executive Officer of a Redwood City, California-based Clarent Corporation.  His misconduct, and that of another Clarent executive, led Clarent, a now-bankrupt provider of Internet telephone products, to overstate its revenue by 33% for the fourth quarter of 2000, and by 23% and 39% respectively for the first two quarters of 2001.  The Commission sued former CEO Jerry S. Chang, 45, of Los Altos Hills, California, for allegedly inflating Clarent's revenue through fraudulent sales transactions and siphoning cash to a company in which the other Clarent executive and his family held influential positions.    The complaint alleges that, in December 2000, Chang induced a Taiwanese technology firm to place separate orders totaling $15 million for Clarent hardware and software by promising that, if the firm could not resell the products, Clarent would arrange for a company associated with the family of the other Clarent executive to buy the goods (as in fact ultimately occurred).  These side arrangements made it improper for Clarent to recognize revenue for the sales, but, according to the complaint, Chang concealed the secret deal terms from Clarent's finance personnel, causing the company to report phony revenue to the public.  The complaint further alleges that, in June 2001, Chang directed the unauthorized release of $35 million from Clarent's Asia Pacific office to the entity related to the other Clarent executive and his family.  Chang also arranged an additional $11 million loan guarantee for this entity.  Neither the $35 million cash disbursement nor the $11 million loan guarantee was disclosed to Clarent's financial personnel or management.  These improper payments caused Clarent to overstate its cash and to fail to disclose a liability.  The Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, charges Chang with violating the antifraud, corporate reporting, books and records and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws, and seeks injunctions, disgorgement, monetary penalties, and orders barring them from serving as officers or directors of public companies.   	In particular, the Commission asserts claims against Chang for violations of Sections 10(b), 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Securities Act"") and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1  and 13b2-2 thereunder as well as for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.   In a related matter, the Commission filed a separate action against the former President of Clarent's Asia Pacific office, Matthew M Chiang, charging him with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, corporate reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.  (Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.)

Loomis, et al., United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Civil Action No 2: 09-CV-00458-MCE-KJN (E.D. Cal.)  SEC CHARGES LAWRENCE LOOMIS AND JOHN HAGENER WITH FRAUDULENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF INVESTMENT FUNDS   The Commission today charged a Roseville, California man and his company with misappropriating approximately $10 million from more than 100 investors through the fraudulent sale of interests in two purported real estate investments funds.  According to the complaint, Lawrence ""Lee"" Loomis and John Hagener told investors they were ""liquid high-yield accounts"" that would be invested in short-term home loans. They promised investors 12% annual returns from the investments and told them their accounts were safe, savings-like accounts. In fact, the claims were not true. The complaint alleges that the Naras Funds were commingled with money of several entities and then spent on operating expenses, such as payroll, utilities, travel, and other expenses that did not qualify for investment in the funds, including mortgage payments on homes purchased with the loans, mortgage insurance premiums, credit card bills, rent payments to homeowners, car payments, a car loan, an ATM card, home equity refinancings, mortgages, loans to be repaid by the investors, or a mortgage loan to a third party. Investors were told their funds would earn 14% returns on their investments, which was guaranteed by deeds of trust on the homes the borrowers had purchased, as long as the money invested was safe and liquid. However, investors' money was also spent to pay the expenses of the other companies that were losing money and financing the operations of their own companies. As a result of these actions, according to court documents and testimony provided to SEC staff, defendants were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), (2), and (3) ofÂ the Investment Advisers Act and Rules 206a-1, (a) &#8220","-->            Home &#160;&gt;&#160; Litigation &#160;&gt;&#160; Litigation Releases &#160;&gt;&#160; 2010    2010  -->  -->            U.S. Securities and Exchange CommissionLITIGATION RELEASE NO. 21422 / February 23, 2010Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Loomis told investors they were investing in safe âliquid high-yield accountsâ that would earn 12 percent returns guaranteed by a third party. The SECâs complaint alleges that Loomis and Hagener instead used the money primarily to prop up Loomisâ other failing businesses. The SEC further alleges that Loomis paid himself hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies that received investor money and Hagener received more than $190,000 for managing the funds even though he was misappropriating investorsâ money to fund other businesses.According to the SECâs complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, Loomis attracted investors to âLoomis Wealth Solutionsâ seminars held in 2007 and 2008 through newspaper advertisements and direct mailings. Loomis solicited seminar attendees to invest in two investment funds called the âNaras Secured Funds,â claiming the funds would make short-term secured loans to homebuyers, yielding 12 percent returns to investors. The SEC alleges that, contrary to Loomisâ promises, the loans were primarily used to pay such operating expenses as payroll, utilities, and travel expenses for several other businesses owned by Loomis, and to prop up a related real estate scheme. The SEC also alleges that the loans were not secured by real estate deeds of trust as Loomis had claimed. Hagener allegedly facilitated the scheme by transferring investorsâ money to accounts that he knew were being used to fund the other businesses. Hagener also allegedly sent investors fake account statements falsely stating that their investments had earned 12 percent returns.In its federal court action against Loomis, Hagener, Loomis Wealth Solutions, LLC (âLWSâ), and Lismar Financial Services, LLC (âLismarâ), the SEC alleges Loomis, LWS, Hagener and Lismar violated Sections 5(a), (c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also alleges Hagener and Lismar violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and, in the alternative, that Hagener aided and abetted LWS, Loomis and Lismarâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Lismarâs violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

The SEC's complaint, filed on August 11, 2016, alleges that, from approximately October 2013 through March 2014, the defendants issued materially false statements in a press release and SEC filings regarding the companies' operations, revenue projections and acquisitions of various companies. The complaint further alleges, at the same time, that they misrepresented that the three companies had agreed to merge with a company that had no contract for such a deal, when in fact the merger was a publicity stunt that lacked any credible financing options. In addition, according to the SEC, Sullivan edited, reviewed and approved a number of false or misleading public filings that were posted on the firm's website and in SEC Forms 3, Forms 4 and Forms 5 indicating their beneficial ownership in the securities of the two companies, respectively.

According to the SEC's complaint, Sullivan and Loppert were behind the press releases and corporate filings that falsified Global Digital's operations and revenue projections when in reality it had no customers, never manufactured any cyber arms, and never provided any security technology services or solutions.  The SEC's complaint alleges:  Global Digital publicly announced in several press releases in October 2013 that one of its merger targets had become the exclusive original manufacturer of sophisticated grenade launchers for a major international client under a private label agreement with a first stage value of approximately $95 million.&nbsp;  In November 2013, Global Digital issued a press release projecting future annual revenue of $60 million to $75 million during the first quarter of calendar year 2014.&nbsp;  In March 2014, Global Digital announced in filings and press releases that it had made an unsolicited letter of intent to acquire one of the country's largest arms manufacturers for $1.082 billion.   In fact, as alleged in the SEC's complaint, all of these statements were false; the private label agreement announced in October 2013 did not exist, there was no basis for Global Digital's November 2013 future annual revenue projection, and Global Digital operated out of a virtual office, had only $509,224 in cash and a $1.4 million note receivable, had no revenues or operations, lacked any credible, imminent, financing options and its offer to purchase the arms manufacturer announced in March 2014 had been immediately rejected.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Global Digital, Sullivan and Loppert violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaint also alleges that Global Digital violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder and that Sullivan and Loppert aided and abetted these violations.  The complaint also alleges that Sullivan and Loppert violated Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act and Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule16a-3 thereunder.

The complaint further alleged that, as a result of their misrepresentations and omissions, defendants profited handsomely by selling the strategies to clients, who were told that the investments had not performed as advertised, and that their money would be used to fund their retirement and annuity businesses. In fact, according to the SEC, no client assets tracked an investment strategy that was actually fabricated. As alleged, when the firm performed its due diligence, it ignored and concealed certain red flags indicating that certain of its investments were not true and were substantially overstating the company's prior performance performance. Finally, after realizing that these false claims could get them into leg’s trouble, NivellIER and his firm agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and (2), and orders them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment interest and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.

First, Mr. Navellier and his firm allegedly breached their fiduciary duty to clients and prospective clients by ignoring and concealing red flags that should have alerted them that the investment strategies had not performed as advertised.  Second, Navellier & Associates allegedly distributed materially false advertisements and client communications about the performance track record of the investment strategies.  Third, as Mr. Navellier and his firm realized their misrepresentations could get them in legal trouble, they allegedly sold the Vireo line of business in August 2013 for $14 million, rather than correcting their prior misrepresentations to their clients or informing their clients about their conflicts of interest in selling the Vireo business.  Navellier & Associates' advertisements claimed that client assets had been invested in the investment strategies from April 2001 to September 2008 and that the strategies had significantly outperformed the S&P 500 Index from April 2001 to September 2008.  In fact, no client assets had tracked the strategy from April 2001 through September 2008, and even as a back-test the claimed performance was substantially overstated.

According to the Commission's Complaint, from at least 2006 through mid-2008, Mafin, a California resident, implemented a scheme to funnel about 8.5 million shares of stock to a company he controlled. The Commission alleges that, in connection with the pump-and-dump scheme, the defendants falsely represented in press releases that the stock transfer was pursuant to Regulation D, Rule 504 of the Securities Act. In fact, as alleged, these statements were false and misleading. For example, one press release falsely stated that a transfer agent had authorized the transfer of 10 million of these shares, and another falsely claimed that an accounting had been performed, but no such audit had ever been conducted. As a result, investors were sold into the resulting market, generating approximately $6 million in ill-gotten gains from the fraudulent scheme.

According to the complaint, while Matin was Veltex's CEO, he funneled about 10.5 million Veltex shares in an unregistered offering to a company he controlled, Wilshire Equity, Inc. The complaint further alleges that Matin enlisted a figurehead over Wilshire, Mazhar Ul Haque, who immediately resold Veltex shares to the public at Matin's direction. The complaint also alleges that Matin contemporaneously touted Veltex by issuing a series of false and misleading press releases grossly inflating Veltex's revenues, embellishing its overseas operations, and assuring investors that Veltex's financial statements were being audited. The complaint alleges during this time Veltex's stock price fluctuated between $0.33 and $3.30 and that Matin generated approximately $6.5 million from the sale of Veltex shares through Wilshire.The complaint alleges that Matin and Wilshire violated the securities registration and antifraud provisions of the securities laws. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions against each defendant, and disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and additionally as to Matin, a conduct-based injunction barring him from offering unregistered securities in the future.In a separate administrative action instituted on November 1, the Commission ordered Haque to cease-and-desist from committing violations of the securities registration provisions.

Civ. 02-CV-6413)  On May 20, 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S., Northern Districts, of Brooklyn, Brooklyn and Manhattan federal district court in Brooklyn. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 2000 through the mid-2000s of the United Kingdom and elsewhere, 800 AMedia and its principals, David Elie and Edward Rboe, raised approximately $1.2 million from investors by selling unregistered securities in advance of a public announcement that the company would be acquired by a private equity firm. According to the complaint, these funds were to be used to develop and develop a website and other related businesses. In fact, as a result of this offering, hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds have been transferred from one investor account to another. To settle the SEC's charges, which stem from the same conduct alleged in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court against 800AMedia, its CEO, Edward Wadley, a resident of Long Island City, NY, who is also a registered representative, to a third-party registered broker-dealer.

(S.D.N.Y. 02 Civ. 9046)  The Commission today brought an emergency action in federal court in Manhattan to halt an ongoing fraud by 800 America.com, Inc. (&quot;800America&quot;), an Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board company and purported internet retailer; David Elie Rabi (&quot;Rabi&quot;), chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and a director of 800America; and Tillie Ruth Steeples (&quot;Steeples&quot;), an undisclosed control person of 800America.  The Commission alleges that the defendants falsified financial results for 800America since at least 2000, unlawfully sold unregistered stock through nominee accounts, failed to disclose the criminal histories of Rabi and Steeples, and made other misrepresentations.  The Commission has moved for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and other interim relief to preserve the status quo.  Pending the outcome of that motion, on the Commission's application, the court has temporarily restrained the defendants from violating antifraud, registration, and books and records provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (&quot;Securities Act&quot;) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;).  The court's order also provides that, pending the outcome of the preliminary injunction motion:  (a) defendants' assets and certain nominee brokerage accounts are frozen; (b) the defendants are required to submit accountings; (c) a temporary receiver has been appointed over 800America; (d) Rabi and Steeples are temporarily enjoined from acting as officers or directors of public companies and from participating in the offering of penny stocks; (e) the defendants must repatriate assets held abroad; (f) the parties may engage in expedited discovery; (g) the defendants are prohibited from destroying documents and other evidence; and (h) the defendants are prohibited from tampering with witnesses, suborning perjury or otherwise impeding this case.   Specifically, the complaint alleges that:  To create the image of a vibrant enterprise, the defendants fraudulently reported millions in fictitious earnings, revenues, expenses, and assets. To conceal the true results, they created fictitious periodic bank statements, checks, invoices and a general ledger, which they supplied to 800America's auditor.&nbsp;  Rabi and Steeples are selling unregistered 800America stock through nominee accounts in violation of  the registration provisions of the securities laws, and at a substantial profit to themselves.  Rabi and Steeples also misappropriated company assets.&nbsp;  800America issued a press release falsely denying Rabi's criminal past and failed to disclose that Steeples is a control person of the company.  The company's most recent 10-KSB lists as officers and directors several individuals who either have left the company or cannot be located by the company.  As to the three defendants, the complaint alleges that:  1. 800America is a Nevada corporation, has an executive office in New York, and has operations at 1301 North Mount Juliet Road, Mount Juliet, Tennessee.  800America purports to own and operate several Internet websites that retail various products, particularly clothing, or that provide links to websites of other retailers.    2. Rabi, age approximately 62, is the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, a Director, and the majority shareholder of 800America.  Rabi also served as 800America's President for most of the period from July 9, 1999 through January 2002.  On January 3, 1997, Rabi pleaded guilty in McCracken County, Kentucky, to state felony charges of securities fraud, acting as an unregistered broker-dealer, and selling unregistered securities.  Rabi was sentenced to four years imprisonment, which was commuted, based on the four years Rabi had already served in Tennessee state prison fighting extradition to Kentucky on these charges.    3. Steeples, age 55, is not disclosed as having any affiliation with 800America in 800America's public filings, but is acting as an undisclosed control person of the company.  Among other things, she controls some of 800America's bank accounts, and represents that she is 800America's Secretary, both in her own name and under the alias &quot;Ruth Walley.&quot;  On November 14, 1996, in Nashville, Tennessee, Steeples pleaded guilty to delivering cocaine into a prison.  Steeples was sentenced to six years imprisonment for this conduct, and was incarcerated from January 1, 1997 to November 24, 1999.  The complaint charges violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2), 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.  As final relief, the Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; civil penalties; and, against Rabi and Steeples, final penny stock and officer and director bars and a forfeiture of stock under their control.

Galanis, John P., Gary T., Michelle A. Morton and Francisco Martin, Civ. Action No.: 16-CV-3505 (WHP) (SDNY)  SEC Files Amended Complaint in Connection With Tribal Bond Scheme  On May 27, 2015, the Commission filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a fraudulent and unregistered offering of tribal bonds.  The SEC's original complaint, filed on May 29, 2014, alleged that Jason Galanis of Los Angeles, California, and six of his associates, including his father, enlisted a Native American tribal corporation to become the issuer of the tribes' limited-recourse bands, to issue the Tribal Bonds. The complaint further alleges that the defendants used the bond proceeds to purchase luxury goods, boost the net capital of two broker-dealers and finance the initial public offering. According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, J. Jason Galans enlisted his family members and others to fund the tribal bond issuances and to pay the criminal defense costs of J&quot;Cooney and Hirst, along with his wife, Michelle Morton of Oceanside, Calif., and his son, James Jason, who was charged with securities fraud and convicted after a jury trial of one count each of conspiracy to commit securities and investment adviser fraud. In a parallel action, U. S. District Judge James O. Currid entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze and other emergency relief against Jason and the other defendants, enjoining them from further violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting the registration and antifraud provisions of Section 206(4)-8(the ""Advisers Act""). The Court also entered an order freezing the assets of all defendants and appointing a receiver over the entities under which Jason had previously been charged. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant consented to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejud","On November 14, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission added Francisco Martin of Woodland Hills, California to a civil injunctive action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging him with defrauding investors in sham Native American tribal bonds.  The SEC's amended complaint alleges that Martin, along with seven other co-defendants, participated in a scheme to convince a Native American tribal corporation affiliated with the Wakpamni District of the Oglala Sioux Nation to issue limited recourse bonds that Jason Galanis and his father, John Galanis, had already structured.  As Jason Galanis allegedly told two of his associates, the &quot;primary objective&quot; of the scheme was to provide Jason Galanis and his associates &quot;a source of discretionary liquidity.&quot;  Jason Galanis then allegedly acquired two investment advisory firms and installed officers to arrange the purchase of $43 million in bonds using clients' funds.  The amended complaint further alleges that in exchange for $150,000 from Jason Galanis, Martin served as the &quot;Managing Director&quot; or &quot;Portfolio Manager&quot; of a fake entity that was held out to bond investors as an independent investment manager for the bond proceeds.  Through his role with the fake investment manager, Martin facilitated the transfer of proceeds from investors in the tribal bonds to Jason Galanis and his associates.  The SEC further alleges that instead of investing bond proceeds as promised in annuities to benefit the tribal corporation and generate sufficient income to repay bondholders, the money wound up in a bank account in Florida belonging to a company controlled by Jason Galanis and his associates.Â  Among their alleged misuses of the misappropriated funds were luxury purchases at such retailers as Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Barneys, Prada, and Gucci, and to support an IPO of a technology company in which Jason Galanis and several other defendants had interests. Â  Investor money also was diverted to pay attorneys representing Jason and John Galanis in a separate criminal case brought parallel to the SEC's stock fraud charges last year.  In addition to Martin, and Jason and John Galanis, the amended complaint also names as defendants Devon Archer of Brooklyn, N.Y., Bevan Cooney of Incline Village, Nev., Hugh Dunkerley of Irvine, Calif., Gary Hirst of Lake Mary, Fla.,Â  and Michelle Morton of Colonia, N.J., all of whom were charged in the original complaint in this matter.  The amended complaint charges Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst, Jason Galanis, John Galanis and Martin with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Morton with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and Section 209(f) of the Advisers Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  In addition, the Commission alleges, in the alternative, that Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst, John Galanis and Martin violated Section 15(b) of the Securities Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 20(3) of the Exchange Act by aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC seeks disgorgement plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctions against all defendants, and officer-and-director bars against Jason Galanis, Archer, Dunkerley, and Morton.  Jason and John Galanis, Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst and Morton were also charged criminally by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

According to the SEC's complaint, between at least early 2012 and early 2016, while doing business as SpotFN and a number of other companies' websites and other related websites, SuLEYMANOV engaged in a scheme to defraud retail investors, some of whom were senior citizens without in-vestment experience. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the scheme, many investors suffered losses, including losses of retirement funds, which SpotFIN encouraged investors to use to trade binary option securities. As the complaint further alleges, in order to generate more money for his company, he used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses. In fact, investors were unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds because the software had not been installed on their accounts and the account balances had been frozen, and no procedure was available to get back their invested funds.

The SEC's complaint alleges that from at least 2012 to 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of binary options, which are securities that pay out depending on the outcome of a ""yes/no"" proposition, such as whether a specific equity security will close at or above a specified price on a given trading day.   Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds.  Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds.  As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses.  In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses.  The SEC's complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

Hansen and Stuart Kobrovsky, Civil Action No.: 09-CV-4918 (E.D. Pa.)  SEC Charges Two Former Keystone Equities Executives with Insider Trading   On March 23, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charging two former Keystone Equity Group executives with insider trading based on material, non-public information that they received from a longtime friend and former business associate.  The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, between June 20, 2006, and the date of the merger of two publicly-traded companies, Hansen traded on the information and tipped his long time business partner, a retired stockbroker, who likewise traded. According to the complaint:  Hansen was tipped concerning pending acquisitions by his longtime business friend Donna B. Murdoch, whom he met while working together at Keystone's offices in Oaks, Montgomery County, PA. The insider tips were both material and nonpublic and included common stock purchases of AT! Technologies, Inc. and Freescale Semiconductor Inc., through accounts in Hansen's daughters' names, as well as trades in both Freesale and Bausch &amp; Lomb call options through Murdoch's account. When Hansen received the illegal tips from Murdoch and Hansen, he then traded them on behalf of his daughters, realizing illegal profits of at least $215,345.&nbsp;  In addition to trading in advance of merger talks between the two companies and in connection with the acquisition talks, Murdoch tipped Hansen about the pending deals through his brokerage account, which he used to purchase out-of-the-money call option contracts. As a result of their illegal trading, all of Hansen&rsquo;s profits totaled more than $1.1 million, for a total profit of over $220,000. In a parallel criminal case, Gansman was convicted by a jury of six felony counts and sentenced to 12 years in prison for securities fraud and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $22,945, plus a $10,690 civil penalty.

Hansen, et al., Civil Action No. 10-CV-5050 (E.D.P.A., September 27, 2010)SEC CHARGES FORMER REGIONAL INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM CHAIRMAN AND HIS FORMER STOCKBROKER FRIEND WITH INSIDER TRADINGThe Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in an insider trading case filed today that from at least the summer of 2006 through the spring of 2007, Richard A. Hansen (âHansenâ), a registered representative and the former chairman of a regional investment bank, traded on inside information concerning at least five pending corporate acquisitions. Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Hansen tipped his longtime friend Stuart Kobrovsky (âKobrovskyâ) about one of the acquisitions, and that Kobrovsky, in turn, traded on that information. The Complaint alleges that Hansen and Kobrovsky made illegal trading profits of approximately $215,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Kobrovsky has agreed to settle the Commissionâs allegations against him, and his settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration.The Complaint, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that defendant Hansen learned of each of the pending acquisitions, and the identity of the target companies, from his business associate, Donna Murdoch (âMurdochâ). Murdoch in turn, according to the Complaint, had learned the information from James E. Gansman (âGansmanâ), then a partner in the Transaction Advisory Services Department of Ernst and Young, LLP (âE&amp;Yâ). According to the Complaint, by tipping Murdoch with material, non-public information about pending acquisitions, Gansman breached of a duty of confidentiality he owed to E&amp;Y and its clients; and Murdoch, in turn, tipped Hansen. Hansen is then alleged to have traded on that information, and in one instance to have tipped his longtime friend, Stuart Kobrovsky, who also traded. The Complaint alleges that Hansen and Kobrovsky knew or recklessly disregarded that the tips on which each traded stemmed from a breach of duty to the informationâs source.For their part, Murdoch and Gansman were both defendants in the recently settled civil case of S.E.C. v. James E. Gansman, et al., 08-CV-4918 (PKC) (S.D.N.Y.). Both settled without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations. Both were also charged in a parallel criminal case. In that criminal case, Murdoch entered guilty pleas to a total of 17 felony counts and is awaiting sentencing. Gansman was convicted by a jury of six felony counts and acquitted of four. He is currently incarcerated pending his appeal. See United States v. Gansman et al., 08 Cr. 471 (SGC) (S.D.N.Y.))According to the instant Complaint, Hansen used material, nonpublic information Gansman provided to Murdoch, who in turn provided it to Hansen, by:trading in his daughtersâ accounts in the securities of at least two companies that were acquisition targets of E&amp;Yâs clients, ATI Technologies (âATIâ) and Freescale Semiconductor (âFreescaleâ); and trading through Murdochâs account in ATI, Freescale and Bausch and Lomb, another acquisition target client of an E&amp;Y client, realizing illegal profits totaling at least $52,000;Â tipping his longtime friend, defendant Kobrovsky, concerning one of the pending acquisitionsâthat of Freescale; Kobrovsky, in turn, traded on this information realizing illegal profits totaling $163,000.The SEC complaint charges that Hansen and Kobrovsky each violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of unlawful trading profits with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, Kobrovsky signed a consent that providesâsubject to approval by the Courtâfor the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him against future violations of the Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment to which Kobrovsky consented would further order that he is liable for disgorgement of $163,000 together with $39,589.17 in prejudgment interest thereon, but, based on his sworn financial statements and other documents submitted to the Commission, would waive payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and not impose a civil penalty.In a parallel criminal case also filed today, the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York charged Hansen with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, in a three-count criminal information.

Elliott, et al., Case No.: 2:12-cv-00887-JCM-RJJ (District of Nevada)  SEC Files Settled Fraud Charges Against Three Individuals in Connection With the Offering and Sale of $163 Million of Investment Contracts to Approximately 1,200 Investors   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court in Nevada charging three individuals and their companies with conducting an international fraudulent scheme involving the offer and sale of investments in two resorts in Dominican Republic.  According to the SEC's complaint, from approximately the fall of 2004 until early 2009, the defendants solicited investments through entities they controlled, including EMI Sun Village, Inc., a Turks and Caicos Islands corporation, and SUN Village Juan Dolio, INC. (collectively, ""Sun Village""), a St. Vincent and the Grenadines corporation. The complaint alleges that these defendants sold two types of securities, called ""Residence"" and ""Passport"" investments, representing timeshare and ownership interests, respectively, in Florida and Puerto Rico, which were being developed and constructed by entities controlled by Elliott. In fact, only a very small percentage of investor funds were actually used to renovate and construct the resorts, as had been represented. Instead, investors were largely used for other purposes, such as the payment of exorbitant undisclosed sales commissions and promised returns to earlier investors. Investors were told that their principal was safe and that they would share in their projected appreciation of the resort's value. Nevertheless, they did not disclose to investors the true extent of their commissions, or the amount of those commissions that would be deducted from their investment. They also failed to inform investors that the returns were guaranteed and would not be returned to their investments until a later date. Moreover, investor money was used primarily to pay for renovations and other expenses, with the vast majority coming from investors' personal bank debt and a down payment from Elliott and his related entities. Finally, to make up for their misappropriation of funds, Elliott sold the Residence and Passport investments as ""non-use fees"" (""NUF"").

Catledge and Derek F.C. Elliott, and certain of their related entities, with making material misrepresentations to investors in connection with the unregistered sale of interests in two resorts in the Dominican Republic.  The SEC alleges that Catledge, a Nevada resident, and Elliott, a Canadian citizen and resident of the Toronto area, raised more than $163 million from approximately 1,200 investors between the fall of 2004 and 2009. The securities offered, called âResidenceâ and âPassportâ investments, represented timeshare and ownership interests, respectively, in the Cofresi and Juan Dolio resorts in the Dominican Republic  The complaint alleges that Catledge and Elliott promised investors a secure return of 8% to 12% annually on the Residence investment and 5% on the Passport investment. Investors were assured that their principal was safe, and that they would share in the projected appreciation in the value of the resorts. According to the SECâs complaint, investor funds were not used to construct the properties, as had been represented, but instead were largely used for other purposes, including the payment of exorbitant undisclosed commissions and promised returns to earlier investors. The SEC alleges that, of the nearly $164 million raised from investors, approximately $59 million (36%) was used to pay commissions to Catledge, Elliott and several of their related entities, among others.  The SECâs complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, financial penalties, and permanent injunctive relief against Catledge, Elliott, Sun Village Juan Dolio, Inc., EMI Sun Village, Inc. and EMI Resorts (S.V.G.), Inc. to enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws. As to Catledge and Elliott only, it also seeks an injunction against acting as an unregistered broker-dealer. The complaint also names D.R.C.I.

IN THE MATTER OF MADERA INTERNATIONAL, INC., Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10577  IN THE MATTER OF REGINA FERNANDEZ, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10578  IN THE MATTER OF HARLAN &amp; BOETTGER, LLP, WILLIAM C. BOETTGER and P. ROBERT WILKINSON, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10580  IN THE MATTER OF RALPH SANCHEZ, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-10579  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the filing of two complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charging three former officers of Madera International, Inc. with falsifying Madera's financial statements and fraudulently inflating the company's assets, sales and net income.  Madera was engaged in exporting timber from South America.  Named in the first complaint are Madera, Ramiro Fernandez-Moris, who beginning in March 1996 was Madera's president, chief executive officer and chairman, and Daniel S. Lezak, who was Madera's chief executive officer and chairman until March 1996 and thereafter functioned as its chief financial officer.  The complaint alleges that during the period from 1994 through early 2000, the defendants: (1) recorded as assets of Madera various purported timber-producing properties to which it had no apparent legal title; (2) assigned unrealistic values to those properties; (3) recorded revenues from phony sales; (4) failed to disclose significant related party transactions; and (5) furnished false sales invoices, shipping documents, cash receipts records, and audit confirmations to Madera's auditors.  These practices resulted in the filing with the Commission of numerous false and misleading periodic reports during the period from 1994 to 2000.  The defendants in this action also issued false press releases concerning, among other things, Madera's results of operations and business prospects.  Fernandez-Moris and Lezak enriched themselves by selling Madera stock during the period of their falsification of the Company's public disclosures.    The Commission's Complaint seeks from Madera, Fernandez-Moris and Lezak permanent injunctions against future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Exchange Act&quot;), Sections 10(b), 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) and 13(b)(5) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, as well as civil money penalties pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, and, additionally with respect to Fernandez-Moris and Lezak, disgorgement and officer and director bars.    The Commission also instituted an administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act to determine whether the registration of Madera's common stock should be revoked.  Madera has failed to file periodic reports with the Commission since its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 1999.  In addition, according to allegations of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, Madera included in its annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 financial statements that failed to conform with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in that they materially overstated the value of Madera's revenues and gross profits.    The Commission also authorized administrative proceedings and the filing of a civil action against Regina Fernandez, Madera's corporate secretary.  Simultaneously with the institution of the administrative proceedings, and without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Fernandez consented to the issuance of an order requiring that she cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records provisions of the Exchange Act.  In addition, Fernandez consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, to a Final Judgment in an action filed against her in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.    The Commission also authorized the institution and simultaneous settlement of administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice against Madera's former outside auditor, Harlan &amp; Boettger, LLP, its two audit partners, William C. Boettger and P. Robert Wilkinson as well as the Company's successor auditor, Ralph Sanchez.  Harlan &amp; Boettger, LLP,  William C. Boettger and P. Robert Wilkinson consented to the entry of an order permanently denying each of them the privilege of practicing as accountants before the Commission.  Ralph Sanchez consented to the entry of an order denying him the privilege of practicing as an accountant before the Commission with a right to reapply after one year.     &nbsp;SEC Complaint in this matter.",0.6763,0.3929
471,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Marc A. Celello, the former general counsel of Credit Nation Capital, LLC, a Georgia-based Ponzi scheme that raised tens of millions of dollars from investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, from 2009 to 2015, CN Capital sold unregistered promissory notes to investors, many of whom were elderly and/or retired. The offering memoranda falsely touted that the notes were ""100% asset backed"" and ""backed by hard assets dollar for dollar."" The complaint alleges that, contrary to these representations, they were not backed by assets and, in fact, generated insufficient returns on its investments to cover its cash flow needs. As a result, investors were left with virtually no money to pay for their investments and the company was unable to generate any returns at all. In a parallel action, on October 5, 2017, Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against Cecco, who was also charged by the Commission with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), (2), and (3) &amp; 206 (4)-8(A&#8217; in connection with the same conduct.&nbsp;  The SEC also filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Atlanta, Georgia against the defendants, alleging that they violated the securities registration provisions and violations of Sections 204(4),(5) (6), (""Securities Act"") and (""Exchange Act"").

Torchia, was a partner in Credit Nation Capital LLC and served as general counsel for the underlying entities, helped orchestrate a Ponzi scheme involving unregistered promissory notes which falsely promised a 9% return.  He allegedly prepared offering memoranda and directed sales and marketing representatives to lie to investors that the promissory notes were secure investments ""backed by hard assets dollar for dollar.""  The complaint further alleges that Celello knew that Credit Nation Capital was insolvent and directed an employee to fabricate a fraudulent balance sheet that made it appear to be profitable.  Celello also allegedly helped transfer investor funds from CN Capital to Torchia for Torchia's personal use.  Between 2009 and November 2015, when the SEC obtained a court order stopping the alleged Ponzi scheme, Credit Nation Capital raised at least $30 million from investors.

Blockvest and Ringgold also allegedly misrepresented Blockvest's connections to a well-known accounting firm, and continued their fraudulent conduct even after the National Futures Association (NFA) sent them a cease-and-desist letter to stop them from using the NFA's seal and from making false claims about their status with that organization.  The Honorable Gonzalo P. Curiel, Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California,Â issued an order freezing defendants'Â assets and other emergency relief. The order also temporarily prohibits Blockvest and Ringgold from violating the antifraud provisions and securities registration provisions.

Enterprises, LLC, Brian V. Prendergast, Worldwide Equity Corporation, Donald R. Smith, and Yuail I. Enwia, Civ. No. 1:09-CV-00217 (WYD) (D. Colo.)  SEC Brings Fraud Charges and Obtains Emergency Relief to Stop Ongoing Prime Bank Scheme Targeting Seniors  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") charged Brian V. Prendergast of Castle Rock, Colorado, and his entity Enterprises, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, with conducting a fraudulent prime bank offering scheme in coordination with Donald R. Smith of Aurora, Colorado, Yuail I. Enwia of Ceres, California, and Worldwide Equity Corporation (""WEC""), a Nevada corporation. The Commission alleges that Prendergast, who has previously been convicted of criminal securities fraud in Colorado and is currently on court-supervised release, purported to raise $2.5 million from investors, several of whom are senior citizens. On February 4, 2009 the Court entered an order granting a temporary restraining order against the defendants, requiring accountings, and freezing the defendants' assets derived from investor funds obtained in the fraudulent scheme.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed February 4, 2009 in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, the representations to investors had all the hallmarks of a fraudulent prime bank scheme. According to the complaint, Prendergast solicited seniors and induced them to pull equity out of their homes, sell off other investments, and liquidate their retirement accounts in order to invest in the fraudulent scheme. Prendergast allegedly represented to investors that monies invested in Enterprises would be pooled with other investors' funds to create a $2.5 million fund, and that the pooled funds would then be invested in WEC, which is run by Smith and Enwia. The complaint alleges Prendergast told investors that the Enterprises investment was ""a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" and that the funds wired from Enterprises to WEC would be traded in ""investment grade securities through international banks."" The Commission further alleges that Prendergast represented to investors that the Enterprises investment will generate ""guaranteed"" returns of four to 20 percent per month, depending on the amount invested, for a total return of 48 to 240 percent per year from the trades conducted by WEC. Investors in Enterprises were also warned to keep information about the investment ""strictly confidential"" since WEC's transactions were ""sensitive in nature."" According to the complaint, as many as 14 other investors have invested in Enterprises and WEC.  The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all the defendants.

Cifaldi, Neil Silver, and Robert Davis, Civil Action No.: 1:05 CV 02051 (RWR) (D. Fla.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER OFFICERS OF INTERCALLNET, INC. WITH FRAUD  The Commission today charged the former officers of Intercallnet, Inc., a multi-media voice and on-line communications company headquartered in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, with engaging in a fraudulent scheme involving the sale of unregistered securities by unlicensed broker-dealers, as well as fraudulent accounting and re-porting practices, by the officers, directors and agents of the company.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least March 2000 through December 2000, the defendants participated in the fraudulent promotion of stock by making material misrepresentations and omissions to potential investors, including that the stock promotion commissions paid to defendants were disguised as payments for property, equipment and intangible assets, when in fact they were paid directly to Defendants Silver and Davis by Defendants Davis and Silver. The complaint alleges that these commissions were made in part by indirect commission payments to sham companies under their control. After the payments had been made and in preparation for an independent audit, invoices were created and back-dated for the earlier payments made to companies controlled by Silver or Davis. As a result of this conduct, InterCallnet filed materially false financial statements and its periodic reports with the SEC from April 2001 through November 2002. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and an officer and director bar. In addition, defendant Davis has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, books and records and internal controls provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, to disgorge $1.5 million of his and his companies' commissions and pay $2.2 million in disgricated interest.

Nguyen targeted the Vietnamese-American community in California and elsewhere through paid weekly talk shows on Vietnamese-language TV, during which Nguyen falsely presented himself as an experienced former Goldman Sachs banker, and failed to disclose that he was a twice convicted felon, including for a prior investment scam.  As alleged in the complaint, Nguyen offered investors the chance to invest in a ""fund"" he called ""Nguyen Tran Le Fund""; undisclosed to investors, however, the so-called fund is really a collection of financial accounts held by Nguyen, NTV, and Nguyen's girlfriend.  Nguyen also, according to the complaint, falsely promised investors 16% annual returns, that their investments were 100% guaranteed, that he had never lost money managing client accounts, and that they could withdraw their money at any time-all while he was losing significant investor money.  Nguyen allegedly also improperly used about $600,000 in investor funds for business and personal expenses, including purchases of a home and vehicles.  On June 14, 2019, the district court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Nguyen and NTV.  The court's order freezes the defendants' assets and temporarily bars Nguyen from accessing his clients' brokerage accounts.

According to the Commission's complaint, from about February 2002 through June 2005, the defendants began selling TCI shares to investors, purportedly on behalf of the company, long before they had any means of delivering the shares they promised. They also diverted a significant amount of investor funds to pay personal expenses, such as purchasing a family home they shared, purchasing automobiles and paying off gambling debts. In addition, they diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed commissions to two stock promoters, Peter Perez and Cort Poyner. Once a public market in TCi's shares began trading in 2005 and they began dumping the stock, further enriching themselves, while preventing the public investors from receiving share certificates they needed in order to sell their shares.

According to the Commission, investors were told, among other things, that the shares could be freely traded and would be listed on a national stock exchange shortly, none of which was true.   The complaint also alleges that the Hamedanis did not inform investors that up to 25% of their investment would be paid as commissions to two stock promoters, or that some of the stock proceeds were being secretly funneled back to the Hamedanis and to Two Dog Net, Inc., a company they controlled.   The Commission's complaint also charges The Children's Internet and Sholeh Hamedani with making false filings with the Commission in furtherance of the scheme to defraud investors, and, in June 2005, filing a false restatement of previous financial statements in an effort to cover up the scheme.   Also charged in the Commission's complaint are two stock promoters, Peter A. Perez, 40, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Cort L. Poyner, 37, of Delray Beach, Fla. The Commission charges Perez and Poyner with assisting in the sale of unregistered stock and making false statements and omitting material facts to induce investors to buy stock.   The Commission's complaint charges that Sholeh and Nasser Hamedani, Peter Perez, Cort Poyner, The Children's Internet Inc., and Two Dog Net, Inc. violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the federal registration provisions, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The promoters are charged with acting as unregistered broker-dealers (Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act). The complaint also charges Sholeh Hamedani with causing The Children's Internet to report false financial information to the Commission (Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the related Rules); and with causing The Children's Internet's failure to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act). The complaint also charges Sholeh Hamedani with circumventing internal accounting controls (Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act); with falsifying the company's books and records (Rule 13b2-1 under the Exchange Act); with lying to the accountants (Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act) and falsely certifying The Children's Internet's financial statements (Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act). Sholeh Hamedani is further charged with failing to report changes in her ownership of The Children's Internet stock (Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act).   The Commission's lawsuit ultimately seeks the return of all ill-gotten investor funds as well as penalties and other relief from the defendants, including permanent injunctive relief, officer and director and penny stock bars against the Hamedanis, and penny stock bars against Poyner and Perez.

481,"On April 28, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Kamal Zuhdi Abdallah, a recidivist securities law violator, with defrauding two elderly investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, since August 2016, Abdalla defrauded investors of at least $260,000 through the offer and sale of unregistered securities. The complaint alleges that, while serving a supervised release portion of his criminal sentence for his felony conviction for securities fraud, he used a fictitious name to conceal his past from his victims and lied to investors regarding the nature and use of the investment proceeds. Abdallah allegedly used investor funds to pay his and his family's personal expenses, including paying credit card bills and cash withdrawals, and to make payments to his wife and daughter, who are both residents of San Antonio, Texas. In a parallel action, on March 30, 2012, Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and the relief defendants, freezing their assets and appointing a receiver over the defendants' offshore accounts and imposing a permanent bar from soliciting or selling investments in any security or any other security. On April 27, 2018, Rakkoff was sentenced to 42 months in prison, followed by three years of supervision and $224,072 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, for a total of $1.2 million in ill-gotten gains and a $9,990 civil penalty.

The SEC alleges that Kamal Zuhdi Abdallah recast himself as Kamal Sulleman to solicit and defraud two elderly investors in Texas out of at least $260,000.  The SEC also named his daughter Zeina Abdallah and two companies as relief defendants because they received illicit proceeds from Abdallah's alleged fraud.  In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that, while serving the supervised release portion of his criminal sentence in United States v. Abdallah, 09-cr-717 (E.D.N.Y.), Abdallah used a fictitious name to hide his criminal past from one of his victims, and when soliciting investments, Abdallah lied to his victims regarding the nature and use of investment proceeds.  Of the $250,000 invested by Abdallah's first victim, this investor transferred $50,000 to relief defendant Seriaga Investments, Inc. (""Seriaga""), a company controlled by Zeina Abdallah, and $200,000 to Administrative Outsource Services, Inc. (""AOS""), a company controlled by Abdallah.  Rather than use investor funds to invest in a currency trading scheme as he had promised, Abdallah, instead, made cash withdrawals and otherwise used the investor funds to pay for his and his family's personal expenses.  For example, within days of receiving $200,000 from the first investor, Abdallah withdrew $189,500, consisting of:  a wire transfer of $175,000 to Zeina Abdallah's personal bank account; a $10,000 check to Zeina Abdallah; and a $4,500 withdrawal by Abdallah.

Gary M. Workman, United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Civil Action No.: 05-CIV-4949 (D.N.H.)  SEC CHARGES FORMER PRESIDENT OF ENTERASYS NETWORKS WITH VIOLATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL REGISTRATION SCHEME  Enterasys Networks, Inc. Sues Former President of Asia Pacific Division for Participating in Accounting Fraud  On September 29, 2004, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Gary W. Worh, a former president of the Asia-Pacific division of Cabletron System Inc., and his former subsidiary, Enterasuys Network Corporation, alleging that he participated in a scheme with other officers and employees to inflate revenues of Entemys and its former parent company, CableTron (which are jointly referred to herein as âEnterasu).  The Commission's complaint alleges that from March 2000 through December 2001, Worlanan and others entered into transactions that lacked one or more necessary elements for revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in order to improperly manage the company's revenues at quarter end.  According to the complaint, these transactions included transactions in which the purchaser was granted full return, exchange, or cancellation rights, which did not reflect the true terms of a transaction, but was subject to an undisclosed side merit that precluded the payment of revenue. The complaint further alleges the improper revenue was material information because the vendor was not a genuine purchaser and, in some cases, simply didn't need the product to be sold. Moreover, some of these investment transactions lacked economic substance and were not consummated during the quarter. As a result of their improper accounting practices, enterasu's financial statements were materially overstated by 5% to 33% for five quarters during fiscal year 2001 and by 8% and 25% respectively. In carrying out the scheme to impry infomercial infusions of revenues from these sales transactions, workman also misrepented information to his outside auditor concerning the false nature of some transactions for which he had improperly recognized revenue in the prior quarter and in prior quarters. Additionally, he knowingly participated as a control person","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 19993 / February 7, 2007  SEC v. Gary M. Workman, Civil Action No. 07cv026 (D.N.H.)    On February 1, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled civil fraud action against Gary M. Workman in United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Workman, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, consented to an injunction against future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder; and from aiding and abetting any violation of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Additionally, Workman consented to paying disgorgement in the amount of $165,241, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $40,231, reflecting the full amount of his ill gotten gains. Additionally, Workman consented to paying a civil penalty of $20,000.  According to the Commission's complaint, from March 2000 through December 2001, Workman, the former president of the Asia Pacific division for Enterasys Networks, Inc., participated in a company-wide scheme to fraudulently inflate revenues at Enterasys and its former parent company, Cabletron Systems, Inc. and thereby convince the market that Enterasys was a viable independent company with consistently strong revenue growth.  The Commission's complaint further alleges that Workman directly participated in transactions which involved undisclosed side agreements in which the purchaser was granted full return or exchange rights, or payment for the product was contingent upon the purchaser's resale of the product, or payment was contingent upon an investment by Enterasys. In the latter, Enterasys agreed to take a debt or equity interest in its customer, in return for that company's agreement to use those funds to purchase product from Enterasys.

SEC Charges Seven Individuals in $9 Million Investment Fraud Targeting Church Members of Church  On September 24, the Securities &amp; Exhange Commission filed a civil injunctive action charging seven individuals and seven entities in connection with a fraudulent investment scheme that targeted parishioners of a church in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, between January and October 2005, seven individual defendants, many of whom were active members of the church, raised over $10 million from 80 investors through the sale of unregistered limited partnership interests in Jadis Capital, Inc., a hedge fund that promised incredible returns, sometimes as high as 50 or even 75 percent. Instead of investing the money as promised, they used investor funds to purchase luxury items, including a Bentley automobile, expensive watches, luxury vacations, car payments, rent, office equipment, insurance, utilities, etc., and to satisfy prior debts.  When the funds ran out of money in January 2005 and the defendants started a second fund with the intention of diverting the proceeds to pay back investors in their first scheme. According to the Complaint, from September 2005 through November 2005 the Defendants raised more than $8.3 million in funds from investors from which they misappropriated approximately $1.4 million to make purchases of luxury automobiles, clothing, jewelry, designer clothing and home furnishings, a luxury Bentley, an expensive watch, $200,000 in luxury furniture, entertainment, travel, business expenses and other personal expenses. They lost most of their remaining funds through bad trades and with no recourse to recover their ill-gotten gains from the second fraud. In a parallel action, on September 30, 2005 a federal judge entered a temporary restraining order enjoining the seven defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) the securities laws and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20998 / April 14, 2009    SEC v.

The seven individuals defrauded scores of investors of more than $12 million by making numerous misrepresentations, including promises of returns as high as 75 percent, to encourage them to invest in two hedge funds - the Logos Fund and the Donum Fund.  Instead of investing the money as promised, the defendants misappropriated millions of dollars to furnish their own lavish lifestyles with purchases of luxury cars, jewelry, clothing, meals, and expensive foreign travel.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, NY, the fraudulent scheme was orchestrated by seven individuals who were active members and leaders of the church:  Isaac I. Ovid; Aaron Riddle; J. Jonathan Coleman; Stephen Cina; Cory A. Martin; Timothy Smith; and Robert J. Riddle.  The Complaint alleges that these individuals used two entities to carry out the fraudulent scheme:  Jadis Capital, Inc. - the hedge fund manager of the Logos Fund and the Donum Fund - and Jadis Capital's subsidiary, Jadis Investments, LLC, a registered investment adviser and the investment manager of the funds.  The SEC's complaint alleges that between January and November 2005, the defendants raised more than $12 million from more than 80 investors in the two funds by making material misrepresentations including promises of incredible returns.  The defendants misrepresented the performance of the Logos Fund, the amount of assets under management, the identity and skill of the portfolio managers, and the level of supervision of the portfolio managers.  The defendants also misrepresented the registration status of the Donum Fund by falsely claiming to investors that the fund was registered with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint further alleges that instead of investing the investor funds as promised, the defendants misappropriated investor funds almost as soon as they were obtained, using the money to buy luxury items including a Bentley automobile and expensive watches.  They also used investor assets to pay for unauthorized operating expenses incurred by Jadis Capital and Jadis Investments, such as the construction of lavish offices, and to satisfy prior debts owed by Ovid.  The SEC's complaint charges each of the defendants (except Logos Fund) with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting each other's violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Further, the SEC's complaint charges Jadis Investments and Jadis Capital with violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and each of the defendants (except Logos Fund and Robert J. Riddle) with aiding and abetting Jadis Investments' and Jadis Capital's violation of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.

Stockman, J. Michael Stepp; David R. Cosgrove; Elkin B. McCallum; Paul C. Barnaba; John G. Galante; Gerald E. Jones; Christopher M. Williams; and Thomas V. Gougherty, Civil Action No 1: 07-CV-2419 (LAP)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that, for more than three years, the company inflated its earnings by improperly recognizing payments from suppliers in return for anticipated future business and other benefits.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least the fourth quarter of 2001 until early 2005, C&A entered into numerous improper ""round-trip"" transactions with a member of its Board of Directors and a supplier of capital equipment. The complaint alleges that the scheme was designed in part to avoid reporting material financial information to investors, and to hide the fraud from the investing public. As a result of the fraudulent accounting scheme and the false earnings figures disclosed in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC, investors were misled to believe that these round-trips were actually indirect increases to earnings and would have no impact on the Company's earnings. In fact, these transactions were intended to improperly inflate its quarterly earnings, secure additional financing, or reduce its pre-tax operating income. At the same time, stockman and his private equity firm, Heartland Industrial Partners (""Heartland""), had invested approximately $360 million in a company that was in financial distress and were preparing to default on $3.2 million of these payments. According, as part of this scheme, Stockmann negotiated the round trip transactions and directed the rebate fraud. Additionally, during this period, St. Louis, Missouri-based broker-dealer Michael Grouve, who helped arrange and collect the improper rebate transactions, allegedly knew about the sham transactions. Finally, in late 2003, a complaint filed in federal district court in Troy, Michigan, filed by KPMG, alleged that St-Louisville, North Carolina broker David Stumbaugh and broker Gerald Jones engaged in fraudulent","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20055 / March 26, 2007  Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2581 / March 26, 2007  AAERxxxxxxx -->  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Gougherty, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, SEC v. Collins & Aikman Corporation, et al. Civil Action No. 1:07-CV-2419(LAP) (S.D.N.Y. March 26, 2007)  Washington, D.C., March 26, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed civil fraud charges against auto parts manufacturer Collins & Aikman Corporation (""C&amp;A""), David A. Stockman (""Stockman""), who served as C&amp;A's former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and eight other former C&amp;A directors and officers.  The SEC's complaint alleges that between 2001 and 2005, Stockman personally directed fraudulent schemes to inflate C&amp;A's reported income by accounting improperly for supplier payments.  In furtherance of those schemes, the complaint alleges that Stockman and other defendants obtained false documents from suppliers designed to mislead C&amp;A's external auditors.  According to the complaint, when aspects of the schemes were discovered in March 2005, Stockman embarked on a public campaign to mislead investors, potential financiers and others by minimizing the extent of the fraudulent accounting and hiding C&amp;A's dire financial condition.  During the time Stockman was engaged in this fraudulent conduct, he was collecting millions of dollars of the management fees C&amp;A paid Stockman's private equity fund, Heartland Industrial Partners.  The other former officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller, and Treasurer, and a former member of C&amp;A's Board of Directors, are alleged to have participated in the accounting schemes or the campaign to mislead investors.  The SEC and C&amp;A have agreed to settle the charges against the company.  In addition to Stockman, the other former C&amp;A directors and officers charged in the complaint are:   J. Michael Stepp, the former Chief Financial Officer of C&amp;A and Vice-Chairman of its Board of Directors; Elkin B. McCallum (""McCallum""), a former member of C&amp;A's Board of Directors; David R. Cosgrove, the former Corporate Controller of C&amp;A; John G. Galante, the former Treasurer of C&amp;A; Christopher M. Williams, the former Executive Vice President of C&amp;A's Business Development Group; Gerald E. Jones, the former Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of C&amp;A's Fabrics Division. Paul C. Barnaba, the former Vice President and Director of Purchasing for C&amp;A's Plastics Division; and Thomas V. Gougherty, the former Controller of C&amp;A's Plastics Division.   The Commission's complaint alleges that between late 2001 and early 2005, the defendants engaged in multiple fraudulent schemes and made materially false and misleading statements concerning C&amp;A's financial condition and operating results in, among other things, filings with the Commission, offering documents, and press releases.  The allegations include the following.    Between the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2003, Stockman and other defendants negotiated a series of ""round-trip transactions"" with McCallum.  These transactions were structured to give the appearance that C&amp;A was receiving rebates that would increase C&amp;A's income from a company McCallum owned.  In fact, because C&amp;A repaid McCallum or his companies for each purported rebate, the transactions should have had no impact on C&amp;A's income statement, and C&amp;A's use of these transactions to inflate its income was improper.&nbsp;  From at least as early as the second quarter of 2002 until the scheme was discovered in early 2005, C&amp;A accounted improperly for actual rebates it received from its suppliers.  Some of these rebates were recognized in income prematurely, while others should never have been recognized in income at all.  At the direction of Stockman and other defendants, C&amp;A's Purchasing Department solicited and received false confirmation letters from suppliers that purported to justify the immediate recognition of rebates in income, and were intended to mislead C&amp;A's outside auditors if they questioned these transactions.&nbsp;  Between the round-trip transactions and the improper accounting for rebates, C&amp;A fraudulently and materially increased its reported income by over $49 million.  As a result, C&amp;A overstated its reported pre-tax operating income (or reduced its loss) by ten percent or more in eight different quarters.&nbsp;  In March 2005 questions from its outside auditor forced C&amp;A to publicly acknowledge the improper accounting for supplier rebates.  However, Stockman, in concert with other defendants, engaged in a campaign to reassure investors, analysts and others that C&amp;A was still economically viable, when in fact the company was on the verge of bankruptcy.  In press releases, an earnings call and a presentation to potential bond investors, Stockman, and other defendants, concealed C&amp;A's liquidity crisis and made unreasonable financial projections.  As a result of these false and misleading statements, C&amp;A obtained additional financing.  But when a more accurate picture of C&amp;A's financial condition emerged a month later, C&amp;A was forced to declare bankruptcy.

The Complaint alleges that on January 30, 2008, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, requiring that the defendant pay a $25,500 civil penalty in connection with his illegal sales of shares of a company formerly controlled by the Chairman, CEO, and second largest shareholder. According to the complaint, in November 2004, when the company became a publicly-traded company, Dudschik sold his shares and caused stock certificates to be issued to him on October 1, 2004. As alleged, during the first two weeks of public trading in Nov&#8217; 2004 through the over-the-counter market in nine transactions, he sold approximately 81% of his stock that he had obtained through a third party. In a sworn financial affidavit filed in federal court on February 19, 2009, on the same day that an administrative court entered a Final Judgment, imposing a cease and desist order and requiring the payment of all ill-gotten gains plus interest in an amount equal to or greater than the amount owed by DudSchik.

486,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Michael S. Moses and Moses Investment Company, LLC, a Colorado-based investment adviser, with making false and misleading statements to investors and prospective investors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, from November 2013 through April 2014, the defendants misrepresented Moses' past experience as a ""Portfolio Manager"" for a private pooled investment fund and his personal investment in WAKE Fund I, LP. The complaint further alleges that Moses made material misrepresentations and omissions about the safety of investments and the use of his portfolio. For example, Moses claimed that he had a successful trading performance during the financial crisis in 2008, but that his investment strategy was risk-free and involved limited downside risk. In reality, as the complaint alleges, in reality Moses had very limited private fund portfolio management experience, did not have a portfolio manager, and used a completely different strategy than what Moses employed to manage the fund. Finally, according to a complaint filed today in federal district court in Denver:  Moses failed to disclose his own prior experience with large private investment advisers, his past investment performance obtained through Moses&#8217;s investment strategies, or his prior trading success.&nbsp;  The SEC alleges in its Complaint that the Defendants violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 206(4)-8(A)(1) in connection with his failure to implement stated risk controls. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and imposing a civil penalty of $974,741, which represents the total amount of investor funds raised. Defendants also agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud and other provisions of Sections 10, 13(j), and 16(c) the Investment Advisers Act, Exchange Act Section 15(d)(4) therewith, Rule 206-4-8, (d.k.a.

A hearing on whether a permanent injunction should be issued against defendants is scheduled for September 25, 2018.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an investment advisory firm and its sole owner and manager with fraud for lying numerous times to investors while raising money for a hedge fund.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from approximately November 2013 to April 2014, Moses Investment Company, LLC (MIC), and its principal, Michael S. Moses, raised approximately $1 million for a private fund they managed, WAKE Fund I, LP, by touting Moses's past experience as a trader or portfolio manager with large private fund advisers, the past investment performance obtained through his investment strategies, the safety of investors' investments, and Moses's personal investment in the fund.  For example, the SEC alleges that Moses and MIC claimed that Moses was a ""Portfolio Manager"" in 2007 for a $750 million global macro fund, highlighted Moses' twenty-four percent trading return achieved during the financial crisis in 2008, and repeatedly represented that the strategy Moses would employ in WAKE Fund was safe and involved limited downside risk.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Moses had very limited fund portfolio management experience, lied about his investment returns, and employed a significantly risky investment strategy that he didn't disclose to investors, which resulted in the near-total loss of the fund's assets.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that Moses and MIC violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Kansas)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas against defendants Alain A. Assemi, Timothy J. Clyman, John D. Friedrich, and Scott F. Klion (collectively the ""Seaforth Principals"") for defrauding at least 70 investors of approximately $18 million through their fraudulent offer and sale of securities called ""limited partnership interests.""  According to the Commission's complaint, the defendants claimed they could generate investor returns by using their own experience and expertise.  In reality, they either misappropriated or cannot account for or explain the disappearance of $13.5 million of investor funds sent offshore, at the expense of a known recidivist fraudster, who was previously enjoined by the SEC in 1999 and sued for securities fraud in 2004. The complaint alleges that the Seafs are responsible for numerous misrepresentations and omissions of material fact concerning, among other things: (1) the sufficiency of financial controls; (2) management&#8217;s investment strategies and objectives; and (3) their knowledge and experience in connection with the fraudulent scheme. For example, according to one SEC filing, defendants James S. Tucker and David T. Tennant were not aware of any past, present or pending material litigation, threats of litigation or complaints against [him]; (4) that defendants' false claims about the safety of the investments were false and misleading; that defendant James Schumacher was not a licensed securities broker; or that Defendant Frederich L. Winkler, a resident of Wellesley, Massachusetts, was a securities lawyer. In addition, as alleged, Defendants Schmacher and Tantler received undisclosed kickbacks totaling $600,000 from the scheme, which they used to pay undisclosed personal and business expenses and to cover up their fraud.

Court Orders Asset Freeze and Other Emergency Relief Against Hegde Fund Seaforth Meridian, Ltd. and Its Principals  On September 14, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Kansas (Topeka Division) issued an order (Order) granting, as against the defendants and relief defendants named in the Commission's complaint, the Commission's emergency requests for an asset freeze, an order expediting discovery and preventing the destruction of documents, and the appointment of a receiver in the civil injunctive action the Commission filed with the Court on September 14, 2006.  The defendants are Alain A. Assemi, Timothy J. Clyman, John D. Friedrich, Scott F. Klion (a/k/a James Tucker and David Tanner), and the three entities they controlled and operated: Seaforth Meridian, Ltd. (Seaforth Meridian); Seaforth Meridian Management, LLC; and Seaforth Meridian Advisors, LLC.  The relief defendants are Henri B. Gonthier and Frederick L. Winkler.  In addition, the Court granted in the Order the Commission's request, as against the defendants, for the repatriation of any offshore funds.  The Commission alleges in its complaint that from as early as March 2004 through at least October 2005, Assemi, Clyman, Friedrich, and Klion (collectively, the Seaforth Principals) fraudulently raised approximately $18 million from nearly 70 - mostly elderly - investors located in several states.  The Seaforth Principals enticed investors to purchase limited partnership interests in Seaforth Meridian with offering materials and oral representations that falsely represented and omitted material information regarding investment strategies and risk of loss, the financial controls over investor funds, and the background, experience, and expertise of the Seaforth Principals.  Specifically, the Commission alleges that the Seaforth Principals misled investors about the supposed conservative nature of the Seaforth Meridian investment strategy while, in fact, sending almost 75% of the funds raised to two highly suspect, offshore funds.  The Commission also alleges that the Seaforth Principals funneled more than $600,000 to themselves without having adequately accounted for Seaforth Meridian's profits or losses.  Further, the Seaforth Principals lulled investors with false monthly account statements and reports that emphasized the safety of the investor funds.  The Commission alleges in its complaint that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission also seeks in its complaint preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations; disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; and the imposition of civil penalties.  The Court scheduled a hearing on September 26, 2006, to determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction.

SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA-BASED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND HIS PRINCIPAL WITH FRAUDULENT AND OBTAINS EMERGENCY RELIEF  The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California charging Los Angeles-based real estate investment adviser Jason Zaki and his firm, real-estate development company Real Fund Investment Advisors, with securities fraud and other violations of the securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, from at least April 2008 through January 2010, the defendants raised approximately $1 million from investors by offering and selling purportedly secure and high yield promissory notes, frequently titled ""Real Estate Secured Promissories,"" to approximately 20 to 30 investors. The complaint alleges that each defendant made materially false and misleading statements and omissions to investors in connection with the offer and sale of these notes. For example:   In addition to making material misrepresentations to potential investors about the safety and security of their investments, Garg and the other defendants failed to disclose that, for nearly the entire offering period, they had already defaulted on their mortgage or other security interest payments, which resulted in defaulting on the principal amount owed to an investor by the investor.&nbsp;  Additionally, none of those defendants was an associated person of a registered broker or dealer with respect to their investment program. Moreover, as alleged, most investors did not receive the promised returns. In fact, at the time of offering, all investors were either unable to pay their principal or had not received any interest from the note. Finally, in a December 2009 webinar presented by Garg in which he told investors that they would receive a first mortgage of $160,000 and a mechanic's lien ofÂÂ $6,500, representing a 50% return on a mortgage that was due in about March 2010. These representations were materially misleading because some, if not all, investments were not secured by first warranty deeds in first and second-half positions.

RealFund and Citiprop are based in, and Garg and Zakocs reside in, Los Angeles, California.  First Atlanta and Weatherby are based in Atlanta, Georgia.  The Complaint alleges that, from at least April 2008 through January 2010, the defendants raised approximately $1 million from 20 to 30 investors who invested in high-yield promissory notes, issued by RealFund, First Atlanta, and Weatherby, the proceeds from which were to be used for real estate development projects.  According to the Complaint, the defendants told investors that their investments were risk-free and guaranteed annual returns ranging from 8% to 24%.  In addition to alleging that these representations were false, the Complaint alleges that the defendants falsely advised investors that their promissory notes would be fully secured by equity in the underlying real estate projects.  The Complaint further alleges that, notwithstanding the defendants' assurances as to the safety of their investment program and unbeknownst to investors, one of the note issuers and real estate development companies for the investment program, First Atlanta, had been involved in bankruptcy proceedings for nearly the entire offering period.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that, notwithstanding First Atlanta's default on some of the promissory notes beginning in September 2009, the defendants failed to disclose this information to new investors and continued to offer and sell their promissory notes as a safe and guaranteed investment through January 2010.  According to the Complaint, the note offerings were not registered with the Commission, RealFund was not registered with the Commission as a broker or dealer, and neither Garg nor Zakocs were associated persons of a registered broker or dealer at the time they sold the promissory notes.  The Complaint claims that, based on this conduct, all of the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint alleges that, at the time of his illegal trading, he was aware that the acquisition was far short of the market's expectations and that his options trading was prohibited. As a result of this conduct, his trading profits totaled more than $300,000. Lâs stock price fell by 35% from the previous day's close, and he avoided scrutiny by failing to seek advance clearance for his trades. Without admitting or denying the allegations, LÂ continued to engage in illegal insider trading and has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,078.50, plus a $42,500 civil penalty and to be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, transfer agent, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Mark Loman, the former Controller and Vice President of Finance of OSI, knew that the company was going to fall far short of its revenue and earnings expectations in the last quarter of 2015.  Just days before the end of the quarter, Loman made options trades betting that OSI's stock would go down in price.  When OSI publicly announced its disappointing quarterly financial results, its stock dropped approximately 35%, netting Loman more than $300,000 on the options trades.  As alleged, Loman further profited from the misuse of nonpublic information by purchasing stock in a target company after he learned that OSI was in negotiations to acquire the target at a premium over its market price.  When OSI's intended acquisition was announced publicly, Loman immediately sold his shares, netting more than $100,000.

The SEC alleges that White, who managed two sales teams, and his sales agent, also received more than $7 million in commissions from the two companies. White allegedly used lead lists to solicit investors, but did not register with the Commission or any state securities regulatory authority with respect to these offerings. In addition, he allegedly paid out a portion of the commissions he received to his own sales team, which he used to close on sales calls with potential investors. As a result of their conduct, Defendants violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c).  The complaint also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and permanent injunctive relief against White. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendant White has consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions and ordering him to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and $900,000 in disgorement and a one-time penalty, for a total of $2.6 million. According, in a parallel action, on August 14, 2020, a federal district court in Miami entered a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants' assets and prohibiting White from participating in any offering of securities, including the sale of unregistered securities in violation of Section 15(c) or the antifraud provisions, ordering that he disgorge all of his ill gotten gains, plus interest and penalties, with a right to reapply for an asset freeze at the time of any application of that order. Also, defendant White agreed to be barred from associating with any SEC-registered broker-dealer and from serving as an officer-and-director or managing a penny stock in connection with an SEC investigation. He has also agreed not to engage in securities law enforcement activities and to cooperate with FINRA and the U.S. Attorney's Office for Miami's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DOS). The settlement is subject to court approval.","On August 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against two sales agents for unlawfully acting as unregistered brokers and selling unregistered investments in two oil and gas companies based in Texas.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Alexander Charles White and Paul Douglas Vandivier illegally solicited and raised money from investors for Aegis Oil, LLC and 7S Oil & Gas, LLC. Both of these companies offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of ""joint venture units"" in oil and gas development projects located in Texas.  According to the SEC's complaint, White managed a marketing team that solicited investors for Aegis and 7S. White and his sales team made cold calls to potential investors using investor contact lists. In return, White was paid transaction-based compensation in the form of a 35% sales commission for each investor his team brought on in the Aegis offering and a 28% to 35% commission for each investor in the 7S offering. In total, White received commission payments of about $6.84 million from the Aegis offerings and $229,000 from the 7S offerings. White paid out a portion of those proceeds to his sales team.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Vandivier managed a sales team that solicited investors for the offerings through his now defunct company, Aegis Marketing, Inc. Vandivier and his marketing team located investors through investor contact lists. Vandivier received commission totaling about $870,000 from the Aegis offerings, a portion of which he paid out to his sales team, and $23,000 from the 7S offerings.  The SEC's complaint charges White and Vandivier with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against White and Vandivier.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Raynette R. Nicoleau, Shan Chang, and Crystal Ivory in the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  The litigation will be led by Russell Koonin.",0.5419,0.5729

The complaint alleges that in a telephone call, defendant Bernard McKnight, age 57, of Westchester County, New Jersey, told his son that he was going to buy stock in his father's company, Animas Corporation, and that his daughter would soon be sold. According to the complaint, the next day, while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the merger negotiations, McKehan purchased 30,000 shares of stock, generating $183,018 in illegal profits. Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have agreed to settle the action by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties. In a parallel action, on May 3, 2007, a federal district court in Manhattan entered a final judgment against the two defendants, permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering them to pay $189,902 in disgorge, prejudgment of $19,039,749, together with a one-year officer and director bar, for a total of more than $1.5 million in trading profits generated by the illegal trading and a $2.1 million civil penalty for each defendant's violations.

Fontanetta With Insider Trading in Connection With Animas Corporation's Announcement of Merger With Johnson & Johnson  McKeehan Agrees to Pay Disgorgement and Civil Penalties Totaling $384,095  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") today announced the filing of a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Burr B. McKeehan, of Monarch Beach, California, and Joseph A. Fontanetta, of Paramus, New Jersey, for engaging in unlawful insider trading in the securities of Animas Corporation (""Animas"") before a December 16, 2005 merger announcement with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Animas, which was headquartered in West Chester, Pennsylvania, designed, manufactured and sold products and services for patients with insulin-requiring diabetes. Its common stock was traded on the NASDAQ National Market System until February 2006, when the merger with Johnson &amp; Johnson became effective.  The complaint alleges that Fontanetta, the Chief Executive Officer and board member of a privately-held medical instrumentation company, tipped material nonpublic information about Animas' merger to McKeehan, a retired podiatrist, two days prior to the merger announcement. The complaint also alleges that Fontanetta either misappropriated or unlawfully received the material nonpublic information from a fellow board member at his company who was the husband of an Animas executive and privy to the merger negotiations.  The complaint further alleges that, during a December 14, 2005 telephone call, Fontanetta unlawfully tipped McKeehan about the Animas merger. Specifically, he told McKeehan that Animas was going to be sold soon and that McKeehan would be making some money soon as a result. Six minutes after this telephone call, McKeehan began purchasing Animas stock. In total, on December 14 and 15, 2005, McKeehan purchased 30,000 shares of Animas stock. On December 16, 2005, the day of the merger announcement, Animas common stock closed at $24.03 per share, an increase of 32 percent over the previous day. As a result of his unlawful trading, McKeehan realized potential profits of $183,018.  The Commission's complaint alleges that by their conduct, the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement by McKeehan of his unlawful trading profits, together with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties from McKeehan and Fontanetta.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, McKeehan has consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to the Court's approval, permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $183,018, plus prejudgment interest of $18,059, and a civil penalty of $183,018.

Crow, Duncan Capital LLC, et al., Civil Action No.: 07-CIV-1022 (SDNY)  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Michael Crow for acting as an unregistered principal of a registered broker-dealer. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from November 2003 through December 2004, Crow controlled virtually every significant aspect of the firm's operations and received the vast majority of its profits. Yet, as alleged in SEC filings, a court order, on consent, denied Crow the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as a certified public accountant, and the right to participate in any PIPE offering. According to the complaint, Fuchs and Crow structured the payment of placement agent compensation to conceal Crow's undisclosed control and his involvement in a number of fraudulent schemes, including the filing of false press releases and false accounting records. Finally, the SEC charged Crow with engaging in insider trading, avoiding losses of approximately $1.2 million by trading his company's stock while in possession of material non-public information concerning the accuracy of Wilshire's financial statements. Without admitting or denying the allegations, all three defendants agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a)(4) and Rule 15b3-1 thereunder and to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $10,000 and $5,500, respectively. In addition, each defendant consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions, to disgorge its illusory profits, pay civil money penalties, or pay a penny stock bar against each of them, for a period of five years. Among other things, neither Crow nor his companies are registered as broker dealers and are not registered to sell securities in connection with an investment-related transaction. As a result, no registration statement has been filed against the defendants or the relief defendants. To settle the charges, defendants have agreed not to violate the anti-fraud, registration, books and records, internal controls and internal disciplinary actions set forth below. Additionally, they have each agreed that they will not be charged with any violations or be liable for any civil monetary penalties.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20117 / May 15, 2007  SEC v.

Crow, an Undisclosed Control Person of a Registered Broker-Dealer, and Others With Violating the Broker-Dealer Registration and Reporting Requirements    On May 15, 2007, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Michael W. Crow, Duncan Capital LLC, Duncan Capital Group LLC (""DC Group""), Robert David Fuchs, and Robert MacGregor with violations of the broker-dealer registration and reporting requirements.   The Commission's complaint alleges that, from November 2003 through at least December 2004, defendant Crow, who had been previously enjoined by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and sanctioned by the Commission, acted as an unregistered principal of defendant Duncan Capital, a registered broker-dealer. The complaint alleges that Crow controlled virtually every significant aspect of Duncan Capital's operations and received the vast majority of the firm's profits. Yet Duncan Capital's regulatory filings failed to identify Crow as an officer, director or ""control affiliate"" of the firm, and falsely stated that: (1) no court had ever enjoined any of Duncan Capital's control affiliates in connection with an investment-related activity; and (2) the Commission had never entered an order against any of the firm's control affiliates in connection with an investment-related activity.  The Commission's complaint also alleges that defendant Fuchs, the owner and nominal president of defendant Duncan Capital and the person who filed the false regulatory filings on behalf of Duncan Capital, acquiesced in Crow's undisclosed control of Duncan Capital and helped facilitate it by, among other things, transferring Duncan Capital's profits to other entities Crow controlled.   The complaint further alleges that, with the knowledge and substantial assistance of Fuchs, defendant Duncan Capital also failed to register several associated persons, including Crow and defendant MacGregor, Duncan Capital's senior managing director in charge of private placements.   The Commission's complaint alleges that by engaging in this conduct, the defendants violated the broker dealer registration and reporting requirements of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that: (1) Duncan Capital violated Sections 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rules 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3(a)(12) thereunder; (2) Crow violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and aided and abetted Duncan Capital's violations of Section 15(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b3-1; (3) MacGregor and DC Group violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and (4) Fuchs aided and abetted Crow, MacGregor and DC Group's violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Duncan Capital's violations of Sections 15(b)(1), 15(b)(7) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b3-1, 15b7-1 and 17a-3(a)(12) thereunder.   In its enforcement action the Commission seeks permanent injunctions against Crow, Fuchs, MacGregor, Duncan Capital and DC Group from future violations of the foregoing securities laws, the disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains and civil penalties.

The SEC alleges that, beginning in February 2019, Clason stole over $300,000 from a retired 73-year-old advisory client.  According to the SEC's complaint, Clason perpetrated the fraud by liquidating securities in the client's accounts, transferring the proceeds from the sales to a bank account held jointly with the client for investment purposes and to facilitate the payment of miscellaneous monthly expenses, and withdrawing cash from the account on numerous occasions and at different bank locations.  The complaint alleges that the client did not know of or approve the withdrawals and did not receive the cash that Clason withdrew.

Adams, United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Civil Action No.: 02-CIV-1179 (SDNY)  SEC CHARGES INDIANAPOLIS FINANCIAL COMPANY AND FORMER CFO WITH FRAUDULENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF EARNINGS  On February 26, 2004, the Securities, Exchange, and Investment Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United State District court in Indianapolis against Conseco, Inc., a financial services holding company based in Carmel, Ind., and its former Chief Financial Officer, James Adams. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from March 1999 through February 2000, Concleco made false and misleading statements about its earnings in filings made with the Commission and in public statements announcing their earnings, overstating their results by hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the complaint, this massive overstatement occurred primarily because of Dick's misconduct. During the same period, Dick, Adams and others under their control, also made a number of unsupported and improper adjustments (âtop-side adjustments) to certain of the financial statements that Conoleco and ConSEco Finance made in its Forms 10-K for 1999, which included restated results for three quarters and the fourth quarter of 1999. These adjustments were inconsistent with GAAP and materially overstated the company's publicly reported net income and operating income by over $1.17 billion. In addition, these adjustments resulted in inflated earnings for each quarter and year-end 1999 by approximately $19.9 million, or 12.1%, or 26.7%, respectively. As a result of these improper accounting practices, however, they overvalued the companies' earnings by more than $2.5 billion and inflated their publicly announced operating profits by nearly 30%.

Adams, (United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Case No. 01:04-cv-0457-SEB-VSS, filed March 10, 2004)  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on March 10, 2004 it filed civil fraud charges against Rollin S. Dick and James S. Adams, formerly Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of Carmel, Indiana based Conseco, Inc., and its then wholly owned subsidiary, Conseco Finance Corporation.  In its complaint, the Commission alleged that throughout 1999 and early 2000, Conseco and Conseco Finance made false and misleading statements about their earnings and income in filings made with the Commission and in public statements announcing their earnings, overstating their results by hundreds of millions of dollars.  This massive overstatement occurred because defendants Dick and Adams conducted a fraudulent scheme to avoid huge write downs of certain assets held by Conseco Finance, known as interest-only securities.  The complaint alleged that in order to avoid the charges to earnings associated with these write downs, Dick and Adams made improper adjustments to the historical basis of these securities, and also manipulated the valuation equation used to test these securities for impairments.  Dick and Adams also made a number of unsupported and improper adjustments to the books and records of these companies to increase earnings.  The complaint alleged that as a result of their activities, Dick and Adams violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and aided and abetted Conseco and Conseco Finance's violations of the reporting, record keeping and internal controls provisions.  Specifically, the complaint alleged Dick and Adams violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and that Dick and Adams aided and abetted Conseco and Conseco Finance's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The complaint seeks an injunction against further violations of the above provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of the salaries and bonuses earned by Dick and Adams during their fraudulent scheme, civil penalties and officer and director bars.    In separate administrative proceedings, the Commission ordered Conseco, Inc. to cease-and-desist from violating the reporting, record-keeping and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws described above.

Mervin George Fiessel and Robert Michael Doherty, Civil Action No.: 05-CV-1179 (E.D.V.)  SEC Charges Canadian and British Columbia Stock Promoters with Market Manipulation  The Securities &amp; Exchange (BCSC) announced today that it filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Canadian citizen and B.C. stock promoter M.Fiesse, 43, of Kamloops, BC. The Commission's complaint alleges that from April through August 2005, the defendants engaged in a market manipulation and securities fraud case involving Greyfield Capital, Inc. (""Greyfield Oregon""), an inactive shell company, and a small used car dealership in Western Canada.  According to the complaint, from early 2005 through the middle of 2005 the Defendants misappropriated and conditioned the market with a series of false and misleading press releases, reincorporated the company in Oregon and falsely claimed that GreyFIELD Oregon had acquired the small dealership. In fact, according to one of the complaints filed in federal district court in Vancouver, FIESsel was involved with the scheme by drafting and issuing hundreds of millions of shares of Greyfields Oregon. After receiving complaints from the original shareholders that the identity of their company had been stolen, Greyview Oregon's stock was sold into the public market and the stock promoters began selling the shares to unsuspecting investors. Fiesel also misled investors by using a website he created to disseminate the false information on the website. As a result of this conduct the Commission suspended trading for five days on July 27, 2006. On June 26, 2007, a day after the initial public release of a press release announcing the acquisition of an automobile dealership by Greylake Oregon, another complaint was filed by the same same complaint against Fiefelbrooke, who was also involved in this scheme. This case is the first case of its kind arising from an SEC-led investigation that has been conducted in connection with this matter. Previously, on June 29, 2008 the SEC filed an enforcement action against the former president and chief executive officer and director of another company for their role in that investigation.

Greyfield traded under the symbol GRYF on the U.S. over-the-counter market and was quoted on the pink sheets.  The Complaint alleges the following:   (1) Fiessel, Doherty and others (either collectively or individually the ""Greyfield Promoters"") misappropriated Greyfield Nevada and its trading symbol GRYF through a series of unauthorized corporate actions, reincorporated the company in Oregon (""Greyfield Oregon""), and claimed that Greyfield Oregon had acquired the Autorama.  As a result, the original shareholders of Greyfield complained that the identity of their company had been stolen.  (2)  The Greyfield Promoters then improperly issued hundreds of millions of new shares of Greyfield Oregon and conditioned the market with false and misleading publicity about Greyfield Oregon, its management and the Autorama.  (3) Almost immediately thereafter, Fiessel and others began selling tens of millions of Greyfield Oregon shares.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fiessel and Doherty consented to:  (1) injunctions against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; (2) officer and director bars; and (3) penny stock bars.  Fiessel also consented to liability for disgorgement of $147,486.60 plus prejudgment interest of $7,634.  Doherty consented to liability for disgorgement of $26,125.40.  Doherty's obligation to pay prejudgment interest of $1,626.32 was waived and no penalty was imposed based on his sworn Statement of Financial Condition.  The BCSC simultaneously announced settlements with Fiessel and Doherty pursuant to which Fiessel also agreed to pay an additional monetary sanction of Cdn.$144,445 to the BCSC.  The BCSC did not impose a monetary sanction on Doherty based on his sworn Statement of Financial Condition.  The BCSC imposed additional non-monetary sanctions on the two British Columbia residents.  On July 27, 2005, the Commission issued an Order suspending trading in Greyfield common stock for ten days because of, among other things, questions as to whether the company was validly reorganized as an Oregon company; the identity of its officers and directors; and whether there had been inaccurate statements about what line of business it was in.  See Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 52127 (July 27, 2005).

Merkowski, with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the violations by CSIM and CS&amp;Co. and the other investment advisory firms. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least 2005 through the present, defendants knowingly or recklessly made a series of materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about YieldPlus, including its supposedly being substantially riskier than cash investments or money market funds. According to the complaint, these statements were materially misleading because, for example, as a result of YieldingPlus's substantial investment in non-agency MBS and lower quality bonds, it was substantially more risky than a cash equivalent or cash-equivalent fund. In addition, according to a separate SEC complaint filed in the U.K. in August 2007, defendant Merg was the lead portfolio manager for a group of other Schwaba-related mutual funds, which were purportedly to invest in a mutual fund that had ""minimal"" outflows, when in fact the fund actually had massive outflows. Moreover, because the funds did not have cash holdings, they were not able to sell assets in such a way as to raise sufficient funds to satisfy the investors' demand for their investments. Finally, in an effort to discourage most investors from redeeming their holdings of their YYield Plus investments and to prevent the sale of assets to investors, Merkr approved a scheme of redemption redemptions of","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 21805 / January 11, 2011  SEC v. KIMON P. DAIFOTIS AND RANDALL MERK, Civil Action No. CV-11-0137 MEJ (N.D. Cal. Jan. 11, 2011)  SEC CHARGES KIMON DAIFOTIS AND RANDALL MERK FOR DEFRAUDING INVESTORS IN THE SCHWAB YIELDPLUS FUND  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Kimon Daifotis and Randall Merk with fraud and other securities law violations in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  Daifotis is the former lead portfolio manager for the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and was the Chief Investment Officer for Fixed Income for Charles Schwab Investment Management (CSIM).  Randall Merk is an Executive Vice President at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. (CS&amp;Co.), and formerly was President of CSIM and a trustee of the YieldPlus and other Schwab funds.  In its complaint, the Commission alleges that Daifotis and Merk committed fraud and other securities law violations in connection with the offer, sale, and management of the YieldPlus Fund.  YieldPlus is an ultra-short bond fund that, at its peak in 2007, had $13.5 billion in assets and over 200,000 accounts, making it the largest ultra-short bond fund in the category.  The fund suffered a significant decline during the credit crisis of 2007-2008 and saw its assets fall from $13.5 billion to $1.8 billion during an eight-month period due to redemptions and declining asset values.  According to the complaint, Merk and Daifotis misled investors about the risks of investing in the YieldPlus Fund.  For example, they described the fund as a cash equivalent or alternative that had only slightly higher risk than a money market fund in marketing and other communications.  The statements were misleading because the fund was riskier than money market funds, and Merk and Daifotis failed to inform investors adequately about the differences between YieldPlus and money market funds.  For example, the maturity and credit quality of the YieldPlus Fund&#8217;s securities were significantly different than those of a money market fund.  The complaint further alleges that, in mid-2007, the YieldPlus Fund&#8217;s NAV began to decline and many investors redeemed their holdings.  Unlike a money market fund, few of the fund&#8217;s assets were scheduled to mature within the next several months.  As a result, the fund had to sell assets in a depressed market to raise cash.  While the YieldPlus Fund&#8217;s NAV declined, Merk, and Daifotis held conference calls, issued written materials, and had other communications with investors that contained a number of material misstatements and omissions concerning the fund.  For example, in two conference calls, Daifotis made false and misleading statements that the fund&#8217;s was experiencing &#8220;very, very, very slight&#8221; and &#8220;minimal&#8221; investor redemptions.  In fact, Daifotis knew or was reckless in not knowing that YieldPlus had experienced more than $1.2 billion in redemptions during the two weeks prior to the calls, which caused YieldPlus to sell over $2.1 billion of its securities.  Similarly, Merk authored, reviewed and approved misleading statements about the fund, such as a false claim that the fund had a &#8220;short maturity structure&#8221; that &#8220;mitigated much of the price erosion&#8221; experienced by its peers.   The complaint also charges Daifotis with aiding and abetting the YieldPlus Fund&#8217;s deviation from its concentration policy by directing the Fund&#8217;s investment of more than 25% of fund assets in private-issuer mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  Mutual funds and other registered investment companies are required to state certain investment policies in their SEC filings, including a policy regarding concentration of investments.  Once established, a fund may not deviate from its concentration policy without shareholder approval.  Schwab&#8217;s bond funds, including the YieldPlus Fund and the Total Bond Market Fund, had a policy of not concentrating more than 25% of assets in any one industry, including private-issuer MBS.  The complaint alleges that the funds violated this policy, and the Investment Company Act, when Daifotis directed the investment of approximately 50% of the assets of the YieldPlus Fund and more than 25% of the Total Bond Fund&#8217;s assets in private-issuer MBS without obtaining shareholder approval.  The complaint also charges Merk with aiding and abetting violations of anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act.  The complaint alleges that Merk approved other Schwab funds&#8217; redemptions of their investments in YieldPlus at a time when Merk knew or was reckless in not knowing that a portfolio manager for those funds had received material, nonpublic information about the YieldPlus Fund without the authorization of the YieldPlus Fund&#8217;s board of trustees.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that:    Daifotis and Merk violated anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act and Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act; &nbsp;  Merk aided and abetted violations of additional anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act, Sections 206(1) and (2);&nbsp;  Daifotis and Merk violated and aided and abetted violations of the false filings provisions of the Investment Company Act, Section 34(b);&nbsp;  Daifotis aided and abetted violations of the shareholder voting rights provision of the Investment Company Action, Section 13(a).    In a related proceeding, the SEC issued a settled administrative order, and filed a settled district court complaint, against CSIM, CS&amp;Co. and Schwab Investments.

498,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Yellowstone Partners, LLC, an Idaho limited liability company, and its former CEO, David Henry Hansen, a resident of Idaho Falls, Idaho, for their roles in a fraudulent scheme to overbill investment advisory clients.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2008 to June 30, 2017, the defendants stole more than $11.8 million from over 120 client accounts by overbilling clients for investment fees that were never earned, generating additional revenue to cover Yellowstone's operating expenses and to support Hansen's lavish lifestyle. The complaint also alleges that Hansen and High were registered representatives associated with a broker-dealer registered with the Commission and were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as with aiding and abetting the scheme by failing to maintain current investment adviser agreements for each client account. Hansen was also charged additional advisory fees for work that was never performed, thereby circumventing the firm's accounting and record keeping requirements. As a result of their conduct, Yellowstone and Hansen were allegedly liable for overstating client assets by approximately $8.5 million. In a parallel action, on November 13, 2018, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff entered a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the three defendants, freezing their assets and appointing a receiver to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.Â  The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against Hansen to freeze the assets of his and his companies, which is subject to court approval.

500,"On March 13, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former attorney with concealing her role in preparing legal opinion letters concerning the sale of microcap securities.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, Diane D. Dalmy, age 64, worked as an attorney for a Denver-based public company, OTC Markets Group Inc. (""OTC Markets""), which owns and operates the largest electronic quotation mark for securities traded on the NASD's trading system for public companies. The complaint alleges that, from September 2009 through December 2016, Dal Myer, a divorce attorney, prepared, and signed, at least 85 letters that she had written expressing the legal opinions that certain shares of stock in microcaps were unrestricted and could be freely sold. As alleged, none of the letters contained any legal analysis or review and none were signed by the attorney who signed them. In September 2015, after being suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as a practicing attorney by a federal court, she was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a) and (c). The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties and an officer-and-director bar. On May 15, 2018, Dmyer was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay $2 million in restitution and a $500,000 civil penalty, which she agreed to be deemed satisfied by her payment of restitution in a parallel criminal case. Datelyn, who lives in Phoenix, Ariz., is currently serving a five-year sentence in federal prison for his role preparing letters for an alleged illegal scheme involving the issuance of unregistered shares in over-the-counter-markets companies, including the purchase of shares by an entity that was not registered under the federal securities laws as required by Section 5 ofÂ the Securities Act.

The SEC alleges that the attorney, Diane D. Dalmy, had been placed on the prohibited attorneys list maintained  by OTC Markets Group, Inc., which owns and operates the largest U.S. electronic quotation and trading system for microcap securities.  To evade the consequences of this prohibition, Dalmy allegedly recruited a retired divorce lawyer, who signed legal opinion letters drafted by Dalmy without performing due diligence or conducting any legal analysis and then sent them on to the firms.  The SEC alleges that legal opinion letters are a significant factor in transfer agents' and brokerage firms' decisions to deem certain securities eligible to be freely sold on the public market without SEC registration, and that transfer agents and brokerage firms often refuse to accept legal opinion letters from attorneys subject to OTC Markets prohibitions.  The SEC further alleges that, in 2016, Dalmy was permanently suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an attorney, which prohibited her from representing clients in SEC matters, including investigations, litigation, or examinations, and from advising clients about SEC filing obligations or content.  Despite this, the SEC alleges that Dalmy continued to prepare filings for publicly traded companies and directed the other attorney to file them with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, charges Dalmy with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions against violating these provisions, a conduct-based injunction prohibiting Dalmy from providing legal services pertaining to federal securities law exemptions from registration and requiring her to provide actual or potential clients seeking advice or representation in matters related to the federal securities laws with copies of the SEC's prior actions against her, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, a penny stock bar, and an order pursuant to Section 21(e) of the Exchange Act requiring Dalmy to comply with the SEC's September 2016 order.

James Clements and Zeina Smidi, Civil Action Number 0:11-cv-60673 (SDTX) (March 30)  SEC CHARGES TWO FLORIDA COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL WITH OPERATING A PONZI SCHEME  The Securities &amp; Exchange &#8212; Commission today filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against two Florida-based entities for conducting a Ponzi scheme that raised at least $30 million from investors nationwide from 2005 to 2007.  According to the Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, the defendants raised funds by offering and selling securities to investors in exchange for high-yield foreign currency trades. The complaint alleges that defendants and their companies solicited investors to purchase securities and promised guaranteed monthly returns of as high as 11% by using the securities of foreign currencies to trade in and/or liquidate investments in foreign debt markets. They also told investors that their money would be used to pay returns toMRT's account managers, and that the promised rate of return would increase from month to month. However, according to their representations, these representations were false and misleading. Instead, they funneled investor funds into a bank account held by a defunct trading firm that never returned the investments. In addition, as alleged, defendants sold investors their own funds for a profit of over $1.5 million and used the money for personal expenses, luxury items, travel, meals, entertainment, retail, rent, a car, personal residence, jewelry, school tuition, retirement savings, car insurance, credit card bills, home renovations, or other luxuries, including vacations, vacations and luxury automobiles. These and other misstatements were not supported by the fact that MRT was not profitable at the time it was offering foreign securities. Moreover, contrary to these claims, Defendants and Defendants sold the investors' funds to a brokerage firm in which they received and sold them their investments at artificially low rates. Finally, in an effort to conceal the fraud, Defendant Jeffrey A. Scheffler, Jr., a registered representative in Miami, Fla., and the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, aided and abetted the fraudulent conduct alleged by Defendants.","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21910 / March 30, 2011  SEC v. James Clements and Zeina Smidi, Civil Action No. 11-cv-60673-LSS, (S.D. Fla.)  SEC CHARGES SOUTH FLORIDA MAN AND WOMAN IN $30 MILLION PONZI SCHEME  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two South Florida residents for conducting a $30 million Ponzi scheme with funds primarily raised by offering and selling unregistered investment contracts and promissory notes to hundreds of investors nationwide from 2005 until the summer of 2007.  The SEC alleges that James Clements and Zeina Smidi of Plantation, Florida, through the companies they jointly controlled: MRT, LLC; MRT Holdings, LTD; and Maximum Return Transaction, LLC, collectively &#8220;MRT&#8221;; operated a Ponzi scheme that offered investors guaranteed monthly returns as high as 11%. From 2005 until the end of 2006, MRT, Clements and Smidi told investors that MRT used investor proceeds to trade foreign currencies and touted MRT&#8217;s investment success to draw in new investors. The SEC&#8217;s complaint further alleges that MRT and Clements used certain investors who agreed to be &#8220;account managers&#8221; to solicit hundreds of investors through informal gatherings and word of mouth.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Clements explained that from the foreign currency trading profits, MRT would pay a small percentage of each investor&#8217;s returns to the investors&#8217; account manager, pay each investor their promised rate of return, and keep any excess profits. Clements and account managers referred investors to Smidi who provided investors information on how to effect their investment in MRT and where to wire funds.  The SEC alleges in its complaint that in June 2007, Clements told MRT&#8217;s account managers that MRT would no longer be trading foreign currencies. Clements and Smidi instead claimed in a letter to investors they wanted MRT&#8217;s money working with the best Swiss banks and advisors and further advised investors they could choose to roll over their existing investment and make future ones into a fixed rate account with a one-year holding period that earned up to 25% annually or a high-yield savings account that earned up to 15% annually but allowed monthly withdrawals.  The SEC alleges that MRT&#8217;s claims were baseless and fraudulent and in reality, Clements and Smidi actually operated a Ponzi scheme with investors&#8217; monies. MRT never traded more than a fraction of what it collected from investors and overall, lost approximately $65,000 trading in foreign currencies. Further, the SEC alleges that MRT never directly deposited investor funds with a Swiss bank and that the returns MRT paid to investors came from subsequent investor deposits.  The SEC also alleges that in addition to misleading investors about MRT&#8217;s use of investor funds, Clements and Smidi also siphoned approximately $3 million of MRT investor monies to their personal bank accounts. They additionally paid out approximately $3 million for travel, expenses, and luxury items.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Clements with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC&#8217;s complaint charges Smidi with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

SEC CHARGES FOUR PRINCIPALS OF HEDGE FUND MANAGER BEACON HILL ASSET MANAGEMENT WITH FRAUD  SEC ALSO EXPANDS CASE AGAINST BEACON HILL  On June 15, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in this pending action naming as defendants the four principals of Beacon Hill Asset Management LLC, a hedge fund manager located in Summit, New Jersey, and expanding the charges against Beacon Hill.  The four principals are John D. Barry, the  President, Thomas P. Daniels, the Chief Investment Officer, John M. Irwin, the Senior Portfolio Manager, and Mark P. Miszkiewicz, the Chief Financial Officer.  The SEC filed the original complaint in this action on November 7, 2002, charging Beacon Hill with fraud.  The case was stayed from February 24, 2003 until May 31, 2004.  The amended complaint alleges that the four principals of Beacon Hill together implemented a fraudulent scheme that resulted in investors losing more than $300 million.  The allegations are that from at least the beginning of 2002 through October 2002, Beacon Hill and its principals made material misrepresentations to investors and engaged in other fraudulent conduct.  The misrepresentations concerned the methodology Beacon Hill used for calculating the net asset values of the hedge funds it managed; the hedging and trading strategy for the purportedly ""market neutral"" funds; and the value and performance of the funds.  The SEC further alleges that central to Beacon Hill's fraud was its method of valuing securities in the hedge funds to show steady and positive returns.  Beacon Hill manipulated its valuation procedures for the Master Fund, the core hedge fund that held and traded securities in Beacon Hill's three feeder hedge funds.  The manipulative conduct allowed Beacon Hill to report steady growth and hide losses in these hedge funds during 2002.  The amended complaint further alleges that as the value of these Beacon Hill hedge funds decreased over the summer of 2002, Beacon Hill nevertheless continued to report positive returns.  Beacon Hill increasingly inflated the prices of the securities in the Master Fund to maintain the appearance of positive returns.  At the same time, contrary to what it was telling investors, Beacon Hill made an increasing and ultimately unsuccessful bet on interest rates rising in an attempt to cover its hidden losses.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Beacon Hill entered into a series of trades between the Master Fund and certain other accounts it managed for two institutional clients (the ""managed accounts"") at prices that defrauded the Master Fund and allowed the managed accounts, whose performances had also declined, to reap substantial profits.  Beacon Hill was able to hide the losses resulting from these fraudulent trades by inflating the value of the securities in the Master Fund to an even greater extent.  Finally, the amended complaint alleges that in September 2002, as their scheme started to unravel, three of the four principals liquidated an account in which they were the only investors by selling the securities in their account to the Master Fund without disclosure to investors.  In early October 2002, when Beacon Hill's prime broker challenged the valuation of the Master Fund and Beacon Hill was forced to admit it had sustained losses, the principals misrepresented the magnitude of the actual losses in an attempt to save Beacon Hill's operations and make the losses appear to be the result of market conditions.  On October 17, 2002, Beacon Hill finally announced the full extent of investor losses, admitting that, as of September 30, the NAVs of its hedge funds had declined 54% from previously reported August 31, 2002 levels, and further acknowledging that it had mis-priced securities in the funds prior to August.  The SEC alleges that by engaging in this conduct, Beacon Hill, Barry, Daniels, Irwin, and Miszkiewicz violated Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, through this conduct Beacon Hill violated Sections 206(1), (2) and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and defendants Barry, Daniels, Irwin, and Miszkiewicz aided and abetted Beacon Hill's violations of these sections.  The Commission seeks from the defendants permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The amended complaint also names as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement from the wives of the principals of Beacon Hill.  The Commission's investigation is continuing.

Machado and Frank Lu, Civil Action Number 09-CV-1131 (SDNY)  SEC FILES SETTLED CHARGES AGAINST FORMER EMPLOYEES OF OTHERS AND FINANCIAL RELIEF  On September 29, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Victor ""Frank"" Lu (""Lu""), a former salesperson at two related entities, Leumi Investment Services Inc. (""LISI"") and Barile Leau USA (""BLUSA""). The Commission's complaint alleges that from May 2003 through mid-August 2004, Lu engaged in a scheme to direct a substantial flow of orders to Lu's firm, OPCO, for execution at prices that were favorable to O.P.O. and, consequently, detrimental to his customers. As part of the scheme, and in violation of his duties to Leii's customers,Machado routinely directed a large amount of order flow from his firm at O&#8217;s trading desk for orders that would be unfavorable to him. In addition, as a result of their fraudulent arrangement, his compensation directly correlated to the volume of trades that he executed.  The Complaint alleges:   From at least January 2003 to March 2004 (the ""relevant period""), Lu was a registered representative employed by O'P, a broker-dealer located in Florham Park, New Jersey. From January to August 2004 and again from January through March 2005, he was employed at an O-P brokerage firm. During the relevant period, however, LISi and BLUSA were both registered with the SEC as brokers and investment advisers. Lu worked at the OPAO brokerage desk primarily involved in executing orders in emerging market fixed income securities. He was responsible for determining the best prices available on the market and then executing the trades on behalf of those customers for their benefit. Through this arrangement and through his role as an ""middleman"" to execute trades with other traders, machado was able to obtain increased compensation from the increase in volume that was generated by the sales of certain securities to other firms. However, when he did not execute his trades as required by market conditions, Machadoknowingly provided Lu with a","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20909 / February 24, 2009  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

No. 34-59437 / February 24, 2009  In the Matter of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-59438 / February 24, 2009  SEC CHARGES FORMER TRADER VICTOR MACHADO AND FORMER SALESPERSON FRANK LU FOR PARTICIPATING IN FRAUDULENT TRADING SCHEME  Leumi Investment Services Inc. and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Each Settle Administrative Proceedings Based on Failures to Supervise Machado and Lu, Respectively  The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against two former registered representatives, Victor P. Machado, a former fixed income trader at two related entities, Leumi Investment Services Inc. (""LISI""), a registered broker-dealer, and Bank Leumi USA (""BLUSA"") (collectively ""Leumi""), and Frank Lu, a former salesperson at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. (""OPCO""), a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, for engaging in a fraudulent trading scheme. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, except as to jurisdiction, both Machado and Lu have agreed to settle the action on the terms described below.  As alleged in the Complaint, from May 2003 through mid-August 2004, Machado and Lu engaged in a scheme to direct Leumi's securities order flow to OPCO in exchange for secret gratuities and entertainment that Lu provided to Machado. The Complaint also alleges that as part of the scheme, and in violation of Machado's duties to Leumi's customers, Machado routinely directed a substantial flow of orders to OPCO for execution at prices that were favorable to OPCO and detrimental to Leumi's own customers. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of Machado's and Lu's conduct, Leumi and its customers were harmed by approximately $1.1 million.  According to the allegations in the Complaint, in mid-2003, Machado and Lu agreed that Machado would direct orders to Lu for execution at prices favorable to OPCO, and Lu, in exchange, would provide Machado with frequent and costly gratuities and entertainment. As part of their fraudulent arrangement, the Complaint alleges that Machado and Lu also harmed Leumi's customers by unnecessarily using OPCO as a ""middleman"" to execute trades with other firms, when Machado could have executed those trades directly with the same firms at prices that were more favorable to Leumi's customers. By engaging in this conduct, the Complaint alleges that Machado and Lu ensured that OPCO realized a quick profit on Leumi's trading with little or no risk.  The SEC's Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Machado and Lu with having violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. Further, Lu is charged with aiding and abetting Machado's violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Machado is charged with aiding and abetting LISI's violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder (broker-dealer books and records provisions).  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Machado has consented to the entry of a final judgment that (i) permanently enjoins him from committing, or aiding and abetting, future violations of the above-referenced provisions, and (ii) based on Machado's financial condition, waives the payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and does not impose a civil penalty. As part of his settlement, Machado has also agreed to the issuance of an administrative order that bars him from association with any broker or dealer.  Lu has consented to the entry of a final judgment that (i) permanently enjoins him from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws referenced above, and (ii) based on Lu's financial condition, orders him to pay partial disgorgement of $100,000, and does not impose a civil penalty. As part of his settlement, Lu has also agreed to the issuance of an administrative order that bars him from association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser.  The proposed relief in the settled actions with Machado and Lu is subject to court approval.  In related administrative proceedings, LISI and OPCO consented to the issuance of Commission Orders, without admitting or denying the findings in the Orders, except as to jurisdiction. In the LISI Order, the Commission found that from May 2003 to August 2004, LISI failed reasonably to supervise Machado with a view to preventing and detecting Machado's violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission further found that Machado frequently improperly changed and falsified trade tickets in an effort to conceal the fraudulent scheme and that, during this period, LISI did not implement reasonable procedures to prevent and detect unauthorized changes to trade tickets by its personnel. The Commission also found that if LISI had implemented reasonable procedures concerning changes to trade tickets, Machado's supervisor could have detected Machado's falsification of the trade tickets and uncovered Machado's fraudulent scheme. Accordingly, the Commission found that LISI had violated Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder because false information was entered into LISI's books and records by Machado. Accordingly, in the Order, the Commission (i) censures LISI, (ii) orders LISI to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder; and (iii) requires LISI to comply with certain undertakings. In determining to accept LISI's offer of settlement, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by LISI, including full reimbursement by LISI and BLUSA of their customers' losses, totalling approximately $1.2 million, and its cooperation with the Commission's investigation.  In the OPCO Order, the Commission found that from May 2003 to August 2004, OPCO failed reasonably to supervise Lu with a view to preventing and detecting Lu's violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission found that, during this period, Lu and Machado had conducted their trading and most of their communications by e-mail on the Bloomberg Mail messaging system that was used by OPCO and that several Bloomberg e-mail exchanges between Lu and Machado presented red flags indicating that Machado was directing order flow to Lu, and in turn, Lu was providing secret gratuities to Machado. The Commission also found that because of a deficiency in OPCO's e-mail review procedures, none of Lu's Bloomberg e-mails was reviewed by OPCO staff, as required by OPCO's electronic communications policy. The Commission found that, as a result of this deficiency, for over four years, OPCO's computer system did not retrieve from Bloomberg, or load into OPCO's database for supervisory review, the Bloomberg e-mail messages for approximately 370 OPCO employees, including Lu. The Commission further found that if OPCO had monitored Lu's Bloomberg e-mail communications, OPCO supervisors could have prevented Lu's misconduct or detected it at an earlier time. Accordingly, in the Order, the Commission (i) censures OPCO; (ii) orders OPCO to pay a civil penalty of $850,000; and (iii) requires OPCO to comply with certain undertakings.

SEC Complaint in this matter  &nbsp;  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaint/pubs/crime/lr1799.htm","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has charged Atlanta-based investment adviser Charles Augustus Banks, IV with defrauding a former professional basketball player by inducing him to invest in a sports team apparel and merchandise company based on a series of misrepresentations about the investment.  The SEC alleges that Banks persuaded his client to invest $7.5 million in Gameday Entertainment LLC and falsely told him that another investor was investing the same amount.  The SEC further alleges that Banks told the client that $5 million of the purported $15 million offering would be used for Gameday's ongoing operations, the remaining balance would pay off existing bank debt, and the client would then have a first lien position on Gameday's assets.  But Banks allegedly knew there was no other investor, the full $15 million would not be raised, and the bank debt would not be paid off, leaving the client without the first lien position he was promised.  Meanwhile, Banks allegedly misappropriated approximately $543,000 from his client, taking an undisclosed fee of $225,000 out of the client's investment and secretly siphoning $15,000 from each $75,000 monthly interest payment from Gameday to his client for approximately two years.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal district court in Atlanta, Banks further deceived the client into signing a personal guarantee on a bank line of credit for Gameday and subordinating his existing Gameday investment to the new line of credit.  Banks deceptively had only the signature pages of the personal guarantee and subordination agreement sent to his client and falsely represented the terms of the agreement contained in the other pages.  Banks allegedly pocketed the &quot;guarantee fee&quot; that should have been paid to the client in exchange for providing the guarantee.  The SEC's complaint charges Banks with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC's complaint, filed on June 13, alleges that, beginning in 2007 and continuing through the present, Jupiter engaged in a multi-faceted scheme to defraud an investment fund managed by Jupiter's principal executive officer and principal compliance officer. Jupiter invested in commodities, energy, natural resources, environmental and energy exploration and was in precarious financial position. In 2007, the firm raised at least $17 million from investors, many of whom were senior executives or portfolio managers. From 2007 through 2008, Juno and Jupiter diverted approximately $2.5 million in investor funds to a corporate apartment in Costa Rica, where they used the money to pay personal expenses, including rent for an apartment, meals, entertainment and purchases from department stores. To conceal the fraud from the Fund's independent directors and external auditors, they transferred the funds into their own bank accounts and transferred them to their personal accounts. As a result of their misconduct and their misuse of the assets, which Jupiter used for its own purposes and for other improper purposes such as operating expenses and legal fees and to repay other investors' debts and pay other undisclosed expenses to Jupiter-related companies. According to court documents filed in connection with the fraudulent scheme, from January 2007 to July 2008 Jupiter issued a series of nine promissory notes (the ""Promissories"") in exchange for a purported payment of a substantial amount of Jupiter assets by the Resources Fund in which the Defendants claimed a total of only $100,000 in","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 21886 / March 15, 2011  Securities and Exchange Commission v.

(TPG)  SEC CHARGES HEDGE FUND MANAGERS WITH FRAUD  On March 15, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a hedge fund investment advisory firm and its two founders with orchestrating a multi-faceted scheme to defraud clients and failing to comply with fiduciary obligations.  The SEC alleges that Eugenio Verzili and Arturo Rodriguez through their firm Juno Mother Earth Asset Management LLC misappropriated client assets, inflated assets under management, and filed false information with the SEC. Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez looted approximately $1.8 million of assets from a hedge fund they manage, misusing it to pay Juno&#8217;s operating costs related to payroll, rent, travel, meals, and entertainment. They issued promissory notes to conceal a substantial portion of their misappropriation. Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez also misrepresented the amount of capital that some Juno partners had invested in one of its funds, claiming they had invested millions of dollars when they actually had invested nothing in the funds.  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Juno sold securities in client brokerage and commodity accounts and directed 41 separate transfers of cash to Juno&#8217;s bank account, claiming falsely that the transfers were reimbursements for expenses Juno had incurred on behalf of the client fund. Verzili and Rodriguez later fabricated and issued nine promissory notes to make it appear that the client fund had invested the money in Juno. But they concealed the so-called investment from the independent directors of the client fund.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint further alleges that Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez marketed investments in the Juno-advised fund and failed to disclose Juno&#8217;s precarious financial condition to investors. They also failed to disclose that Juno owed a client fund a minimum of $1.2 million, which represented the proceeds of the promissory notes. While offering and selling securities in the client fund, Juno repeatedly inflated and misrepresented the amount of assets that Juno managed and claimed at one point that Juno had as much as $200 million under management. Verzili also represented falsely to investors that Juno&#8217;s partners had up to $3 million of their own capital invested in a client fund. Juno&#8217;s partners had never actually invested any of their own money.  The SEC alleges that Juno filed false Forms ADV with the SEC in order to avoid deregistration with the Commission, claiming in those filings that Juno managed $40 million more than it actually did. Verzili and Rodriguez also caused Juno to provide a number of false filings to the SEC that failed to disclose that Juno had engaged in principal transactions with its client and had custody of client assets.  The SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges violations by Juno, Verzili and Rodriguez of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 203A, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-2, 206(4)-4 and 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Tomayko, Case No.: 3:07-CV-1397-K (N.D. Tex.)  SEC FILES SETTLED ACTION AGAINST INTER GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND MICHAEL TOMAYKO TO HALT FRAUDULENT OFFERING SCHEME  On November 20, the Securities &amp; Exchange Act (the ""Commission"") filed a settled enforcement action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division.  The Commission's Complaint alleges that the defendants enticed investors with claims about supposedly lucrative refineries that Defendants and their foreign partners planned to build in Indonesia, and told investors that they were prepared to lavish on their investors and investors. Instead, as reflected in Defendants&#8217; statements, they used investor funds to support their international jet-setting lifestyle and sent them to mysterious foreign nationals who provided no accountability for any funds they dissipated. The complaint further alleges defendants sent an additional $253,000 offshore to a purported Indonesian partner and a pair of unknown individuals who purportedly were supposed to provide access to Swiss financing. According to the complaint, none of the foreign recipients was accountable for these funds and neither the Defendants nor the investors obtained any tangible benefit from these transfers. In addition to halting the offering of promissory notes on May 27, 2008 and the issuance of a final judgment on November 28, 2010, Defendants have agreed to settle the action against them without admitting or denying the Commission&rsquo;s allegations. Specifically, defendants have consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 207(2), and 207 (4)-1 of both the federal securities laws. Defendants also have been ordered to pay disgorgement of $10,704,957 plus prejudgment interest, which will be deemed satisfied by the payment of civil penalties and an officer-and-director bar against each defendant. These settlements are subject to court approval. On the same day, a federal district court in Dallas, Texas","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 21340 / December 17, 2009.  Securities and Exchange Commission v. Inter Global Technologies, Inc. and Michael E. Tomayko. (U.S.D.C., Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, Civil Action No. 3:07-CV-1397-K)  SEC OBTAINS AMENDED JUDGMENT IN OFFERING FRAUD PROHIBITING ANY FURTHER OFFERS OR SALES OF SECURITIES BY DEFENDANTS  On December 10, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an Amended Final Judgment against Defendants Inter Global Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;IGT&#8221;) and Michael E. Tomayko.  The Amended Judgment adds a conduct-based injunction against Defendants, prohibiting them from offering or selling any securities, including notes, issued by Defendants or any entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Tomayko.  This relief was necessary because the Defendants continued to raise funds from investors using improper means even after being enjoined last year.  The SEC originally sued Defendants in August 2007, alleging that they had illegally raised millions of dollars through an unregistered offering of IGT securities to hundreds of investors worldwide.  See Litigation Rel. No. 20244 (August 16, 2007).  The SEC alleged that Defendants made elaborate claims about supposedly lucrative refineries that Defendants and their foreign partners planned to build in Indonesia.  The SEC charged, however, that these claims were false and completely unfounded and that Defendants instead dissipated investor funds to support Tomayko&#8217;s international jetsetter lifestyle (and to cover his house payments and other personal expenses), or sent them to mysterious foreign nationals who provided no accountability for the funds.    Defendants consented to a Final Judgment in May 2008, which permanently enjoined them from committing securities fraud and other violations, and ordered them to pay civil penalties totaling $100,000 and disgorgement with prejudgment interest of more than $10.7 million.  Defendants, however, continued to raise money from investors even after this judgment was entered.  As detailed in the SEC&#8217;s Motion to Amend Final Injunction, Defendants raised at least $1.7 million between May 2008 and September 2009, primarily through sales of promissory notes that were often secured by shares of IGT stock.  In raising these funds, Defendants continued to regale investors with supposed developments with the purported refinery projects, which Defendants constantly characterized as being on the verge of success.    In truth, Defendants used the additional funds primarily to pay Tomayko&#8217;s living expenses.  Defendants&#8217; bank and credit card statements revealed that Tomayko spent more than $200,000 of investor funds on such items as house and luxury automobile payments, utilities, lawn and pool maintenance and country club dues.  An additional $43,000 went toward such sundries as restaurant meals, groceries, dry cleaning, car washes and gasoline.  Tomayko also spent more than $36,000 at luxury retailers, and donated $25,000 of investor funds to his church.  There were also $366,000 in cash withdrawals and checks to Tomayko.  Defendants also sent more than $350,000 overseas to IGT&#8217;s supposed Indonesian partner and two foreigners who were supposed to provide access to Swiss financing.  Investors, however, have nothing tangible to show for these expenditures since, as the SEC asserts in its Motion, Defendants&#8217; purported plans to build Indonesian refineries are no closer to fruition today than when Defendants first began soliciting investors a decade ago.  The additional injunctive relief granted by the Amended Judgment provides a blanket prohibition against Defendants offering or selling any securities issued by them or any company Tomayko owns or controls, regardless of whether the offering is registered or exempt from registration or involves fraud.  Future violations of this or other elements of the Amended Judgment are punishable by civil and criminal contempt.

Fresia, United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Civil Action No 1:07-CV-00494  The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in the federal district court in Denver, Colorado against former chief financial officer of Expanets Inc. (""Expanets""), a large telecommunications subsidiary of Northwestern Corporation (""Northwestern Corporation""). The Commission's complaint alleges that, during the second and third quarters of 2002, the company failed to properly account for its uncollectible receivables and adjustments to customer bills that resulted from computer system problems, causing overstatements of its reported income of 90% and 109%, respectively. The complaint further alleged that Northwestern senior executives misled investors about the nature of the income and the impact of unusual non-compete payments on Northwestern's 2002 financial results. According to the complaint, in April 2003, Northwestern restated its Forms 10-Q for 2002 and erased Expans' previously reported net income for those periods. Northwestern also disclosed significant ongoing problems with the EXPERT system, and related material information that was a standing agenda item for every monthly operations review meeting between Northwestern and its shareholders. As a result of this misconduct, Expanse's financial statements were materially misstated in its 2002 annual report and materially false and misleading, resulting in a materially misleading financial statement. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fresense has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a $50 million civil penalty, an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, as well as to an order permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a), (b)(2)(A), and (B) and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, ordering him to pay a total of $1,077,879.84 in restitution, $2,038.21 in prejudgement and civil penalties, plus $100,000 in officer and director bars.

The Commission's complaints, each filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, allege that John C. Charters, Expanets' former chief executive officer, and Richard E. Fresia, Expanets' former chief financial officer, overstated the performance of Expanets in 2002 during the same period that NorthWestern completed securities offerings totaling more than $800 million.  The Commission's complaints further allege that, after restating its financial results for the first three quarters of 2002, and disclosing Expanets' true financial position and results of operations, NorthWestern declared bankruptcy in 2003.  The Commission alleges that, in NorthWestern's quarterly filings, debt and equity offering filings, and other public information, Charters and Fresia were responsible for overstating the performance of and concealing problems at Expanets.  The Commission alleges that each defendant knew or was reckless in not knowing that Expanets had failed to take appropriate charges for uncollectible accounts receivable and billing adjustments related to the implementation of Expanets' new computer system, resulting in the overstatement of NorthWestern's income from continuing operations by 90% in the second quarter of 2002 and 109% in the third quarter of 2002.  The Commission also alleges that each defendant was responsible for NorthWestern's failure to disclose that a material portion of Expanets' income was derived from the reduction of various accounting reserves and through Expanets' receipt of unusual non-compete payments.  The Commission's complaints charge Charters and Fresia with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The complaints also charge each defendant with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting NorthWestern's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Commission seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against each defendant, and also seeks disgorgement and an officer-and-director bar against Fresia.  Charters, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint against him, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating or aiding and abetting violations of the provisions he allegedly violated, and also consented to pay $50,000 in civil penalties.

Farzin Bazshushtari, United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil Action No CV 12-00354  SEC Charges Former Director of Sales Department of Santa Ana, California-Based STEC, Inc. with Insider Trading  On January 12, 2013, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the U. S. District court in Los Angeles, charging the former director of the sales department of a California company with insider trading. The Commission's complaint alleges that, in 2009, during a ""blackout"" period when company employees were prohibited from trading in company stock or call options based on material nonpublic information his position at the company provided him, he made all of his purchases of company securities in a margin, and he profited by $76,676.50.  According to the complaint, these trades violated the Company's written ethics code, which requires employees not to trade in securities during blackout periods, but rather to disclose the true financial condition of their company and to respect company policies and procedures. In addition to paying disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon and civil penalties of $50,000 and $80,500, respectively, for a total of over $1.5 million, of which $75,600 was paid in cash and the remaining $20,700 was for his wife's purchase of stock in her husband's brokerage account at TD Ameritrade.

The SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed on January 13, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that Farzin Bazshushtari, who lives in Mission Viejo and is STEC&rsquo;s Director of Industrial Distribution, purchased 7,000 STEC shares on April 27, 2009, after learning about STEC&rsquo;s positive first quarter financial results. When those results were announced publicly on May 11, STEC&rsquo;s stock price jumped 30 percent.    The SEC further alleges that Bazshushtari purchased another 5,500 shares on May 27, 2009, after seeing internal weekly sales reports indicating that STEC would outperform second quarter guidance. He additionally purchased 200 STEC call options on June 10. When the company publicly increased second quarter revenue guidance on June 16 to reflect the surging sales, STEC&rsquo;s stock price jumped 26 percent.    According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Bazshushtari made total profits of $76,676.50 by trading on inside information. Bazshushtari knew that he violated company policies when he placed the trades. His April 27 purchase was made during a &ldquo;blackout&rdquo; period when STEC employees were prohibited from trading in company stock. He purchased STEC call options despite STEC employees being prohibited from trading in STEC options, which give holders the right to buy or sell shares in the future. Bazshushtari further violated STEC&rsquo;s written insider trading and ethics policies when he traded on margin and held his STEC securities in a margin account.    Bazshushtari agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by paying $76,676.50 in disgorgement and a $76,676.50 penalty. Bazshushtari also has consented without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations to a permanent injunction from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Calugar and Security Brokerage, Inc., Case No.: CV-03-1600-RCJ-RJJ (RJC) (D. Nev.)  SEC CHARGES LAS VEGAS-AREA INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR FRAUDULENT MARKET TIMING SCHEME  On December 14, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada entered a final judgment against Nevada-based broker-dealer security brokerage firm security brokerage.  The SEC alleges that, from at least 2001 to September 2003, security brokers David Calumet and Michael W. Long, Jr., engaged in a scheme to defraud mutual fund shareholders through practices known as ""market timing"" and ""late trading.""  According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Caluga, through his firm, Security &amp; B.V. Corp. and his brokerage company, Secure Brokers &#151; invested in mutual funds with Alliance Capital Management, LP and Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS).  Most of the market timing trades were through MFS and Alliance funds, which were located in New York, and were conducted through a self-clearing broker dealer firm that he owned and controlled.&nbsp;  Late trading enables the trader to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. EST but that are not reflected in that day&rsquoitation time as determined at market close.Â  Late-term trading is a practice of short term buying and selling of mutual mutual shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in the mutual market pricing. The Commission alleges, for example, that late trading was prohibited because the broker had no legitimate reason for delaying thetransmission of its trades to National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), which is required by the federal securities laws to determine the price at the close of market. In contrast, at Alliance and the hedge funds Cal Sugar was the single largest trader in both funds. As a result of this conduct, investors were able to extend the time to make their market-timing decisions and, therefore, to take advantage of information occurring after theclose of markets.The SEC also alleges in its Complaint that:   (1)","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  Litigation Release No. 18524 / December 24, 2003  SEC v. Daniel Calugar and Security Brokerage, Inc. (U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, Civil Action No. CV S-03-1600-RCJ (RJJ))  SEC Files Emergency Action Against Security Brokerage, Inc. and Daniel Calugar for Engaging in Mutual Fund Late Trading and Market Timing Schemes  Court Orders Immediate Freeze of Defendants' Assets and Orders Defendants Not to Destroy Documents  On December 22, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Security Brokerage, Inc. of Las Vegas and its president and majority owner, Daniel Calugar, for their participation in a scheme to defraud mutual fund shareholders through improper late trading and market timing.  From at least 2001 to 2003, Calugar, trading through Security Brokerage, reaped profits of approximately $175 million from improper late trading and market timing, principally through mutual funds managed by Alliance Capital Management and Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS).  Calugar, age 49, is an attorney with residences in Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  Based on the Commission's application, United States District Judge Robert Clive Jones of the District of Nevada issued a temporary restraining order freezing the assets of the defendants, prohibiting the destruction of documents, and granting expedited discovery.  The court scheduled a hearing for January 5, 2004, on the Commission's application for a preliminary injunction.  The Commission applied for the emergency relief after learning that on December 18, 2003, Calugar had transferred $50 million of proceeds from his scheme out of MFS.  This transfer occurred on the same day that the Commission instituted an enforcement action against Alliance in connection with market timing activity.  The Commission's action against Alliance identified Calugar as the largest market timer at Alliance.  The Commission's complaint, filed in United States District Court in Las Vegas, alleges as follows:    Late Trading &#151; &quot;Late trading&quot; refers to the practice of placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after market close at 4:00 p.m. EST, but at the mutual fund's NAV, or price, determined at the market close.  Late trading enables the trader to profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. EST but that are not reflected in that day's price.  Because Security Brokerage was a self-clearing broker-dealer, it was permitted to submit trades that it received from its clients before 4:00 p.m. EST to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) after 4:00 p.m. EST.  Security Brokerage created false internal records in which the order time for all trades was entered as 3:59 p.m. EST.  Calugar, who was trading on his own behalf and therefore making trading decisions, routinely sent trades for his own account to the NSCC one to two hours after 4:00 p.m. EST, even though he had no legitimate reason for doing so.  &nbsp;  Market Timing &#151; &quot;Market timing&quot; refers to the practice of short term buying and selling of mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  From at least 2001 to September 2003, the defendants engaged in extensive market timing of Alliance and MFS funds despite knowing that the prospectuses for those funds either prohibited or discouraged timing and that timing was not available to most investors.  With Alliance, Calugar agreed to make long-term investments (referred to as &quot;sticky assets&quot;) in Alliance hedge funds in exchange for Alliance permitting him to engage in market timing in its mutual funds.  Calugar made a similar proposal to MFS which was not accepted, but he nevertheless continued to engage in market timing in MFS funds.  Security Brokerage and Calugar are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition to the emergency relief granted by the court, the Commission is seeking a judgment of permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and monetary penalties.

Securities and Exchange Commission Charges Five Wall Street Professionals in Two Insider Trading Schemes   The Commission today filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging insider trading schemes in which eight securities industry professionals, three hedge funds, two broker-dealers, and a day-trading firm made thousands of illegal trades and millions of dollars in illicit profits using inside information provided by an executive of UBS and Morgan Stanley to trade ahead of analyst recommendations.  In the first scheme, which has been ongoing since 2001, the Commission alleges that at least eight individuals, including a portfolio manager for a hedge fund, profited from trading on this material, nonpublic information by purchasing and selling securities in their personal accounts and using the information to pay off personal debts to Franklin and his father-in-law, who also traded on the illegal profits from their trading. The complaint also names as defendants three registered representatives at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. (Bear St. John's), a registered broker and investment adviser, Q Capital Investment Partners, LP (Q Capital), and Assent LLC (Assent) as well as four day traders, Mark E. Lenowitz, Robert D. Babcock, Andrew A. Srebnik and Ken Okada, all of whom were also involved in this scheme. According to the complaint, in connection with the second scheme the defendants made more than $15 million in unlawful profits, by trading ahead in advance of corporate acquisition announcements and by tipping Franklin with confidential information about impending analyst upgrades, downgrades and other recommendations to themselves and to other investors. As a result of their illegal trading, these individuals allegedly made over $600,000 in illegal gains. In addition, each of the four defendants allegedly received kickbacks to supervisory personnel at the day trading firm where they were associated, or from the trading of securities for other securities. Finally, as alleged, one defendant, Frank Frank, illegally traded in his own personal account in exchange for receiving confidential tips from an attorney who was part of an insider trader scheme involving the same insider tipping scheme that led to","U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Litigation Release No. 20022 / March 1, 2007    SEC v.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against fourteen defendants in connection with two related insider trading schemes in which Wall Street professionals serially traded on material, nonpublic information tipped, in exchange for cash kickbacks, by insiders at UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. The complaint alleges that in the first scheme, which has been ongoing since 2001, at least eight securities industry professionals, three hedge funds, two broker-dealers and a day-trading firm, made thousands of illegal trades and millions of dollars in illicit profits using inside information misappropriated by a UBS executive to trade ahead of UBS analyst recommendations (the ""UBS Scheme""). The complaint alleges that in the second scheme, several securities industry professionals and a hedge fund made dozens of illegal trades and hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits using inside information misappropriated by an attorney at Morgan Stanley to trade ahead of corporate acquisition announcements (the ""Morgan Stanley Scheme""). Collectively, the complaint alleges, the defendants made at least $15 million in illicit profits from these two insider trading schemes.  The Commission's complaint alleges that in the UBS Scheme, from at least 2001 through 2006, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, an executive director in the equity research department of UBS, illegally tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming UBS analyst upgrades and downgrades to at least two Wall Street traders, Erik R. Franklin and David M. Tavdy, in exchange for sharing in the illicit profits from their trading on that information.  According to the complaint, Franklin illegally traded on inside information in his personal accounts and for two hedge funds he managed: Lyford Cay Capital, LP, a hedge fund at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. and Q Capital Investment Partners, LP. Franklin also traded in his and his father-in-law's personal accounts. The complaint alleges that to avoid detection of this scheme, Guttenberg used coded text messages on disposable cell phones to communicate the tips to Franklin and arrange meeting places where Franklin would pay Guttenberg his share of illegal profits in cash. The complaint further alleges that Tavdy illegally traded on this inside information for Andover Brokerage, LLC and Assent LLC, registered broker-dealers where Tavdy was a proprietary trader. According to the complaint, Tavdy also traded on this inside information stolen from UBS in his personal account, the accounts of a relative and friend, and the accounts of Jasper Capital LLC, a day-trading firm with which Tavdy was associated.  The Commission further alleges that Franklin and Tavdy also had downstream tippees who traded on the UBS tips. Franklin tipped Mark E. Lenowitz, who illegally traded on this inside information for DSJ International Resources Ltd. (doing business as ""Chelsey Capital""), a private hedge fund where Lenowitz was a portfolio manager, and in his personal accounts. As alleged in the complaint, three registered representatives at Bear Stearns who knew of Franklin's UBS tips (Robert D. Babcock, Andrew A. Srebnik, and Ken Okada) also illegally traded on this inside information in their personal accounts and, in the case of Babcock, for the Lyford Cay hedge fund. Additionally, the complaint alleges, David A. Glass, the owner of Jasper Capital, a day-trading firm that operated from the New York City offices of Assent, also traded on Tavdy's UBS tips for Jasper Capital. According to the complaint, Glass and Tavdy paid kickbacks to supervisory personnel at Assent to not disclose this trading scheme. Collectively, the complaint alleges, Guttenberg, Franklin, Tavdy, and their tippees made at least $14 million in illegal profits from the UBS Scheme.  The complaint alleges that, in the Morgan Stanley Scheme, several of the participants in the UBS Scheme, and others, traded ahead of corporate acquisition announcements using inside information stolen by an in-house lawyer at Morgan Stanley. In this scheme, according to the complaint, Randi Collotta, an attorney who worked in the global compliance department of Morgan Stanley, together with her husband, Christopher Collotta, an attorney in private practice, tipped material, nonpublic information concerning upcoming corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley's investment banking clients, to Marc Jurman, a registered representative in Florida, in exchange for sharing in Jurman's illicit profits from trading on this information. The complaint alleges that Jurman illegally traded on this inside information, and had several downstream tippees who also traded, including Franklin and the Q Capital hedge fund, and two registered representatives at Bear Stearns, Babcock and Okada, who also were involved in the UBS Scheme. According to the complaint, the Collottas, Jurman and their tippees made over $600,000 in illegal profits from the Morgan Stanley Scheme.

511,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former employee of San Jose, California-based Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. with insider trading in advance of quarterly earnings announcements.  According to the SEC's complaint, Yu-Cheng Lin either tipped material nonpublic information regarding the company or personally directed or controlled trading by a close associate of Lin in the U.S. and overseas. The complaint alleges that the associate trader, who was Lin's close friend at the time, traded on the basis of this information, and then sold her position shortly after the announcements, realizing more than $135,000 in illegal profits. As alleged, Lin used the trading profits to purchase shares and call options in a series of microcap securities known as âCFDsâ in accounts held in his own name. In 2016 and 2017, the Associate Trader traded in these securities using a brokerage account that Lin owned, but, on information and belief, she directed her trades. Lin did not trade other securities during the relevant period in which the complaint was filed, as required by the federal securities laws, because he was employed by another company in Taiwan and was not authorized to do so. To settle this matter, without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, defendant Lin consented to entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,078, which is the amount of his ill-gotten gains, plus a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined at a later date upon a motion filed in federal district court in New Jersey. Without admitting to any of these findings, Defendant Lin has agreed to settle the Commission's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to disgorge his illicit profits and pay civil money penalties. He has also offered to cooperate with the Department of Justice in connection with its investigation of similar conduct alleged in this case. See Litigation Release No. 17-cv-00875-JAD (D.N.J.) (filed April 3, 2017).  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of FINRA and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment","On May 23, 2017, a federal court in Newark, New Jersey issued an arrest warrant for a defendant charged with insider trading and found him in contempt of two previously-issued orders.  U.S. District Judge Jose L. Linares found that Yu-Cheng Lin, also known as Believe Lin, had violated two prior orders by dissipating assets and refusing to repatriate funds.  The judge imposed a $1,000-per-day sanction and ordered the clerk to issue an arrest warrant for Lin.  The clerk issued the arrest warrant on May 25, 2017.  In an emergency action filed under seal on February 9, 2017 and unsealed on February 13, 2017, the SEC alleged that Lin traded on material inside information ahead of quarterly earnings announcements on May 5, August 4 and November 3, 2016 by Ubiquiti Networks Inc., a California-headquartered company where Lin had worked from approximately March 2011 until June 2015.  Lin allegedly did so by purchasing Ubiquiti common stock, call options and contracts-for-difference in brokerage accounts located in the United States and overseas.  On April 3, 2017, the SEC filed an amended complaint alleging that Lin directed or controlled trading by a 34-year-old woman residing in Taipei, Taiwan who was a close associate of Lin and traded Ubiquiti securities in 2014 while Lin was working for the company.  The SEC's amended complaint charges Lin with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  The court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order on February 9, 2017 and issued a preliminary injunction on February 24, 2017, each of which imposed an asset freeze and ordered that Lin repatriate money obtained directly or indirectly from the illegal trading and deposit that money into the registry of the court.

SEC CHARGES GEORGIA-BASED REVENUE COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPALS WITH FRAUDULENT SALES OF $2.85 MILLION  On October 28, 2010, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Patricia D. Gruber (""Gruber""), a resident of Dunwoody, Georgia, and her husband, Kar M. Josey (""Josey""). The Commission's complaint alleges that the defendants defrauded at least nine investors in Georgia and Canada by misrepresenting to investors that they would use their funds to purchase a bank guarantee and that those funds would be held in escrow until the bonds were issued. According to the complaint, none of the funds actually existed.  The complaint further alleges, among other things, that defendants represented that investors would receive a 40,000% return on their investment, when in fact they did not receive the promised returns.

Elite Resources, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:10-CV-3522 (N.D. Ga)SEC Charges Atlanta Residents with Securities FraudThe Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) filed a civil injunctive action in Atlanta Georgia on October 29, 2010, alleging that Patricia Diane Gruber (âGruberâ), Kadar Josey (âJoseyâ), and the companies they operated, Elite Resources, LLC (âEliteâ) and Elite3 Holding Corp. (âElite3â), operated a fraudulent âPrime Bankâ scheme that violated the antifraud and securities and broker dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.Â The Commissionâs complaint alleges from at least April 8, 2010 through at least August 20, 2010, the defendants raised approximately $2.85 million from at least nine investors.Â  In raising these funds, the complaint alleges the defendants represented that investors could draw upon bank issued guarantees worth millions of dollars, in one case representing a 40,000% return on investment, without having to repay the withdrawn funds.Â  The defendants further represented that investor funds would be held in escrow until the bank guarantees were issued.Â  The complaint alleges that both of these representations were false in that no such bank guarantees existed and the defendants used almost all of the funds for several undisclosed purposes immediately upon receipt.Â  When investors demanded performance, the complaint alleges that the defendants provided them with a fictitious guarantee certificate purportedly issued by Barclays Bank.Â In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.Â Â  Also on October 29, the court issued an order temporarily restraining defendants from violating these provisions, freezing their assets, providing for expedited discovery, prohibiting the destruction of documents and directing that they provide an accounting for the funds received.Â  A hearing on the Commissionâs request for a preliminary injunction will be held on a date yet to be determined.

Kramer, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Civil Action Relating to the Pump-and-Dump Scheme  SEC Charges Four Individuals and Three Companies in Connection With Multi-Million Dollar ""Pump and Dump"" Scam   The Securities &amp; Exhange Commission announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against four individuals and three companies in connection with a pump- and-dump scheme that raised approximately $1.38 million from 18 investors. The Commission's complaint alleges that, from at least February 2002 until December 2005, the defendants sold unregistered securities and defrauded investors through a series of false and misleading press releases and other material misrepresentations, including claims that Global possessed a nationwide network of broadcasting towers and anti-terrorism technology that would allow the government to monitor and take control of airplanes.  Global was purportedly transformed from a land Internet service provider into a homeland security provider, but its purported technology and assets were still in the process of being acquired by a public shell to become SkyWay Communications Holding Corp., a publicly-traded company. Global's stock price and trading volume increased more than 50 percent from January 2002 to June 2003, when the shell was acquired and sold to a private company controlled by Kent and Baker, who also controlled the company at the time. According to court papers, these false claims were patently false because Global had no towers, no technology to transmit or control airplanes or any other aircraft. In addition, Global never provided any Internet access to aircraft, nor did it have any commercial aircraft or communications equipment. To conceal the use of S-8 stock to pay these commissions, Skyway and Kent signed bogus agreements that stated that Baker would not be paid for any of the stock he raised. At the same time, as part of their scheme, they dumped 76.65 million shares of Global stock on the unsuspecting public and made over $10 million in profits.&nbsp; The defendants also violated Section 15(a) ofÂ the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.

Sky Way Global LLC (dba Sky Way Global, Inc.), Brent C. Kovar, Glenn A. Kovar, James S. Kent, Kenneth Bruce Baker (aka Bruce Baker), and Kenneth R. Kramer, Civil Action No. 08: 09-CV-455-T23/TBM (M.D. Fla., filed March 13, 2009)  SEC Brings Civil Action Against Purported Anti-Terrorism Company, Its Principals and Others for Pump-and-Dump Scheme  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced that on March 13, 2009 it filed a civil injunctive action against Sky Way Global LLC (aka Sky Way Global, Inc.) (Global), an internet service provider and purported anti-terrorism company based in Tampa, Florida, and its principals Brent C. Kovar, Glenn A. Kovar, and James S. Kent, who allegedly defrauded investors through an unregistered fraudulent offering of Global stock and orchestrated a pump-and-dump scheme of SkyWay Communications Holding Corp. (SkyWay). The Commission also charged Kenneth Bruce Baker and Kenneth R. Kramer, alleged unregistered broker-dealers, who found investors for SkyWay and sold SkyWay stock.  The Commission's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that from at least February 2002 until December 2005, Global, Brent Kovar (Global's senior vice president and president), Kent (Global's director of business operations and CEO), and Glenn Kovar (Global's manager and member) raised approximately $1.38 million from 18 investors by offering and selling unregistered shares of Global's stock. In connection with the offer and sale of Global's securities, Global, Brent Kovar, Kent, and Glenn Kovar made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors through marketing and offering materials, including, among other things, that Global possessed a nationwide network of broadcasting towers and anti-terrorism technology that would allow the government to monitor and, if necessary, take control of an airplane. These claims were patently false because Global had no towers and no technology to monitor and take control of airplanes.  The complaint further alleges that after a Global subsidiary merged with a public shell to become SkyWay (in June 2003) and Global transferred its purported technology and assets to SkyWay, Brent Kovar and Kent, with Glenn Kovar's assistance, carried out a pump-and-dump scheme of SkyWay stock. From August 2003 to May 2005, Brent Kovar (SkyWay's President) and Kent (SkyWay's CEO and CFO), issued false press releases to increase SkyWay's stock price and trading volume. The press releases stated, among other things, that SkyWay had a nationwide network of broadcasting towers, and the same purported anti-terrorism technology that Global had claimed to have. The press releases also claimed SkyWay had technology for providing Internet services on airplanes. During the same period, Global, Brent and Glenn Kovar, and Kent dumped 76.65 million shares of their SkyWay stock on the unsuspecting public and made more than $12 million in profits. Brent Kovar and Kent also engaged in other misconduct in connection with the SkyWay pump-and-dump scheme by improperly issuing S-8 stock to promoters Baker and Kramer in exchange for finding investors and selling SkyWay stock.  The Commission's complaint charges Global, Brent Kovar, Kent, and Glenn Kovar with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and further charges Glenn Kovar with aiding and abetting SkyWay's violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The Complaint further charges Brent Kovar and Kent with aiding and abetting SkyWay's violations of disclosure provisions under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-11; and charges Baker and Kramer with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief against all defendants, enjoining them from future violations of the provisions charged, and an order requiring them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them; imposing a penny stock bar against the individual defendants, and an officer and director bar against Brent Kovar and Kent.

515,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser, with failing to disclose certain conflicts of interest.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Commonwealth was paid to select and manage investments for its advisory clients, but failed to tell clients that some investment choices generated additional multi-million dollar revenues for Commonwealth. Commonwealth is also alleged to have received revenue sharing for investment in a ""no transaction fee"" program offered by its clearing firm, which offered mutual fund share classes for which Commonwealth received less or no revenue. The complaint further alleges Commonwealth did not disclose that certain mutual funds had different financial incentives depending on which products they selected for their customers, and Commonwealth had differing financial incentive to invest in those products. In addition, Commonwealth's arrangement with NFS required Commonwealth to retain a clearing broker to manage its clients' assets and to pay a fee for each transaction class. According to the complaint, while Commonwealth disclosed that it would receive revenue for certain of its investment decisions in the ""No Transaction Fee,"" or ""revenue sharing,"" program, it did, in some instances, not receive any revenue at all. As a result of this conduct, the SEC alleges the financial institution violated Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 204(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in its complaint filed in federal court in Boston, Mass., Commonwealth has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting it from violating the charged provisions and a cease-and-desist order. It also consents to an order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of these provisions, including the appointment of a receiver to preserve and marshal assets for the benefit of investors, as well as the imposition of an administrative order against Commonwealth that would require the company to comply with certain undertakings and obligations under the federal securities laws, such as: (1) Commonwealth violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(5) and (3) the broker-dealer registration provision of Sections 5, 5(c), and 10(b)(2)(A), 13(d)(1), 15(e), 16 (a) (filed Aug. 1, 2019)  Commonwealth also agreed to be enjoined from aiding and abetting any violation of those provisions by the Commission and the other parties charged in connection with the same conduct.

According to the SEC's Complaint, since at least 2007, Commonwealth had a revenue sharing agreement with the broker it required most of its clients use for trades in their accounts.Â  Under that agreement, Commonwealth received a portion of the money that certain mutual fund companies paid to the broker to be able to sell their funds through the broker, if Commonwealth invested client assets in certain share classes of those funds.Â  Between July 2014 and December 2018, Commonwealth received over $100 million in revenue sharing from the broker related to client investments in certain share classes of ""no transaction fee"" and ""transaction fee"" mutual funds.  The SEC's Complaint alleges that Commonwealth breached its fiduciary duty to its clients by failing to disclose the conflicts of interest created by its receipt of compensation through the revenue sharing agreement.Â  Specifically, the SEC's Complaint alleges that Commonwealth failed to tell its clients that (i) there were mutual fund share class investments that were less expensive to clients than some of the mutual fund share class investments that resulted in revenue sharing payments to Commonwealth, (ii) there were mutual fund investments that did not result in any revenue sharing payments to Commonwealth, and (iii) there were revenue sharing payments to Commonwealth under the broker's ""transaction fee"" program.  As a result of these material omissions, Commonwealth's advisory clients invested without a full understanding of the firm's compensation motives and incentives.

According to the SEC's complaint, from March 2015 to November 2016, AkBar and his company used a combination of high pressure and deceptive sales pitches and false and misleading offering materials to lure investors. The SEC alleges that the salespeople cold-called investors and made false statements about the company's track record, its ability to produce investment returns and the purported success of its oil and gas projects. In recorded phone calls and e-mail communications with potential investors, they allegedly misrepresented the number of wells Americruer had previously drilled and its trackrecord of success in producing investor returns. Additionally, in recorded telephone calls between investors from April 2015 through atleast September 2015,Akbar allegedly represented his identity in a boiler-room presentation he made to investors that he was the president of a micro-cap company and had been an operator of two oil drilling projects in Texas. As alleged, however, he never disclosed his true identity and criminal history. Instead, as set forth in his sales pitch materials, Amerrue's sales personnel cold called investors across the country and instructed them to purchase interests in Americuude's projects, claiming the potential oil reserves would increase when the wells were drilled or drilled, that Americude had 100% success on any wells, (i) Americrae had $421 million in reserves and $82 billion in assets; and (ii) Ameruae had never drilled oil or gas wells.

The civil lawsuit and criminal indictment allege that Tafeen orchestrated the fraud scheme, and that Wolff and Tafeen participated in executing fraudulent ""round-trip"" transactions to artificially inflate Homestore's revenue in order to exceed Wall Street analysts' expectations. Wolff and Tafeen allegedly knew that the transactions fraudulently generated a circular flow of money in which Homestore recognized its own cash as revenue and concealed the scheme from the company's auditors. The civil and criminal cases also allege that Wolff misled investors and analysts about Homestore's true financial condition and used the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as a pretense for Homestore's financial decline. Wolff and Tafeen both exercised stock options during the course of the fraudulent scheme, obtaining millions of dollars in proceeds.  Homestore.com is now known as Homestore, Inc., a Westlake Village, California, company that provides real estate listings and related services on the Internet.   Wolff, 42, of Westlake Village, California, was Homestore's CEO and chairman of the board from 1997 until he resigned in January 2002 during an internal investigation into the fraudulent scheme. Tafeen 36, of Parkland, Florida, was the executive vice president of business development at Homestore from 1997 until November 2001.  During his tenure, Tafeen reported directly to Wolff. The grand jury indictment charges Wolff and Tafeen with conspiracy to violate the securities laws, insider trading, creating false books and records and lying to Homestore's accountants. Each defendant is charged with 19 counts, and each defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of 185 years in federal prison. An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. The Commission charged Wolff and Tafeen variously with violating or aiding and abetting violations of numerous provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; reporting provisions, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder; record-keeping provisions, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; internal controls provisions, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and, as to Wolff, lying to the auditors provisions, Rule 13b2-2 under the Exchange Act.  The Commission is seeking permanent injunctions, penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, and an order permanently barring Wolff and Tafeen from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Previously in this investigation, nine defendants have pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the fraudulent ""round-trip"" transactions, and two defendants have admitted in plea agreements that Homestore shareholders suffered losses of at least $100 million when the company's stock price dropped precipitously in 2002 when news of an investigation into accounting irregularities became public. The criminal case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The civil case was investigated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

519,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against a New York-based investment adviser and his company for defrauding investors in a series of microcap schemes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey, alleges that Michael J. Hoke, a resident of Newport Beach, Florida, and two of his companies, Hock & Company, LLC and Hutton & Co., Inc., raised more than $1.2 million from investors, many of whom were senior citizens, by persuading them to invest their money in an investment fund that would then be used to pay returns to investors. The complaint further alleges the funds were used for personal expenses, including a personal bank account, credit card bills, rent, meals and a car payment. In addition, the complaint alleges, in some instances, he used investor funds to purchase shares of the fund, which were later sold to other investors for a profit, for his own personal use. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mr.Â Hoke consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and (2) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-1 thereunder, as well as the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 17(a) (of the Securities Act).  In a related criminal action filed by the SEC on September 1, 2016, against Hirsch, who was charged with securities fraud and aiding and abetting the scheme, has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company and from participating in any offering or offering of securities. He has also agreed that he will pay a $25,000 civil penalty and be prohibited from associating with any investment advisory firm or investment advisor.

The Commission's complaint, filed in federal district court in Atlanta, alleges that Watkins and his companies, Watkins Pencor LLC and Masada Resource Group LLC falsely told investors that their funds would be used to support waste-to-energy ventures.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that Waste Management Inc., a large, international waste treatment company, was seriously considering acquiring Watkins Pencor, Masada, and its affiliated companies in a multi-billion-dollar transaction. According to the complaint, Waste Management's ""interest"" in Masada never advanced past a brief initial meeting in August 2012, more than a year after the defendants began telling investors that negotiations were progressing and that the acquisition was imminent.  The SEC charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and a related SEC antifraud rule. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, penalties and return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Watkins' law firm, Donald V. Watkins, P.C., received investor monies and charged the firm as a relief defendant for purposes of recovering the allegedly ill-gotten gains it received.  The Investigation was conducted by the Atlanta Regional Office, under the supervision of William Hicks and Walter Jospin, and the litigation will be led by Paul Kim and supervised by Graham Loomis.",0.4091,0.4485
