SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 6. This case involves unlawful insider trading by Slobodan Dragojlovic in the securities of Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manages a network of ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals. 7. In December 2016, Dragojlovic misappropriated from his brother, an executive at Surgical Care, material, nonpublic information that Surgical Care was in negotiations to be acquired by UnitedHealth Group, Inc., a managed healthcare company based in Minnesota. 8. In breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his brother, Dragojlovic misused this information to purchase shares of Surgical Care stock. On January 5, 2017, Dragojlovic purchased in his personal brokerage account 2,000 shares of Surgical Care stock at an average price of $46.64 per share. 9. On the morning of January 9, 2017, UnitedHealth and Surgical Care publicly announced that they had entered into a definite agreement for UnitedHealth to acquire Surgical Case 2:18-cv-09456   Document 1   Filed 11/07/18   Page 2 of 7   Page ID #:2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28    - 3 - COMPLAINT  Care through a tender offer at a price of $57 per share. That day, after the public announcement of the acquisition, the price of Surgical Care stock increased over 16% on heavy trading and closed at a price of $56.65 per share. Two days later Dragojlovic sold all of the Surgical Care stock. Dragojlovic™s illicit trading profits totaled $20,101. 10. By engaging in the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Dragojlovic violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78n(e)], and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5 and 240.14e-3]. The Commission seeks in this action a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. DEFENDANT 11. Slobodan Dragojlovic (ﬁDragojlovicﬂ), age 53, resides in Santa Clarita, California. During the relevant time period, Dragojlovic worked as an independent software consultant, primarily out of his home. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES 12. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (ﬁUnitedHealthﬂ) is a Delaware corporation based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. UnitedHealth™s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l(b)] and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. 13. Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (ﬁSurgical Careﬂ) was a Delaware corporation based in Deerfield, Illinois. Surgical Care was a company that managed a network of ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals. Prior to its acquisition by UnitedHealth, which was completed in March 2017, Surgical Care™s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l(b)] and traded on the NASDAQ.

At all relevant times in this Complaint, Dragojlovic™s brother was a Senior Vice President for Strategic Services at Surgical Care. As part of his duties at Surgical Care, Dragojlovic™s brother participated in weekly executive team conference calls. 15. In late July 2016, UnitedHealth entered into negotiations to acquire Surgical Care. Dragojlovic™s brother first learned of the negotiations on July 29, 2016, on the executive team weekly conference call. 16. In September 2016, acquisition negotiations between UnitedHealth and Surgical Care were put on hold. Negotiations resumed in December 2016 and by the end of the month, UnitedHealth had taken substantial steps towards commencement of a tender offer for Surgical Care securities. These included a meeting on December 16 between the CEOs of UnitedHealth and Surgical Care at which they reached agreement on major terms of the proposed acquisition (including the per share acquisition price), the execution of a confidentiality agreement on December 19, and due diligence work. 17. On December 17, 2016, the CEO of Surgical Care informed the company™s executive team, including Dragojlovic™s brother, that an agreement had been reached on the material terms of the acquisition. The CEO requested that the executive travel to Minnesota for a due diligence meeting in connection with the acquisition. 18. Dragojlovic™s brother traveled extensively over the next week in connection with the pending acquisition. He travelled from his home in Rancho Santa Fe, California, to Minnesota on December 18, 2016, and returned home on December 20. On December 21, he travelled to Chicago, and returned home again on December 23. 19. On December 24, 2016, Dragojlovic™s brother hosted a family holiday party, which was an annual family custom. Dragojlovic and other family members attended.

He told Dragojlovic this in confidence to explain why he had been traveling that week and why he had not been able to prepare a lavish meal for the family holiday party as he had in past years. 20. Dragojlovic knew the information his brother told him in confidence about the potential acquisition was both material and nonpublic. On January 5, 2017, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to his brother, Dragojlovic traded on this material nonpublic information. He purchased in his personal brokerage account 2,000 shares of Surgical Care stock, at an average price of $46.64 per share.     21. On the morning of January 9, 2017, UnitedHealth and Surgical Care announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement for UnitedHealth to acquire Surgical Care, pursuant to a tender offer, at a price of $57 per share. The agreed purchase price represented a premium of more than 16% over the prior market closing price of Surgical Care stock at $48.75 per share. That day, after the public announcement of the acquisition, the market price of Surgical Care stock increased more than 16% on heavy trading and closed at a price of $56.65 per share. Dragojlovic sold his Surgical Care stock two days later. His illicit trading profits from trading in Surgical Care stock totaled $20,101.

16,"- 1 - UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION          UNITED STATES SECURITIES   AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,            Case No.     Plaintiff,             v.     HON.          ERNEST J. ROMER, III,                 Defendant.       ____________________________________/  COMPLAINT  Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges as follows: SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 1. The SEC brings this civil law enforcement action to address Defendant Ernest J. Romer, III™s (ﬁRomerﬂ) multi-million-dollar securities fraud.  From approximately 2014 through 2016, Romer defrauded at least 30 of his retail brokerage customers out of approximately $2.7 million.  During that time period, Romer worked as a registered representative associated with CoreCap Investments, Inc., a registered broker-dealer with the SEC (ﬁCoreCap Investmentsﬂ). 2. Romer persuaded at least 30 of his customers to sell securities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC (ﬁP&R Capitalﬂ) or CoreCap Solutions, LLC (ﬁCoreCap Solutionsﬂ).  Romer represented to customers that upon transferring money to P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions, he would invest their money in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.1    Page 1 of 10  - 2 - investments.  Based on Romer™s representations, the customers understood that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with CoreCap Investments.    3. Romer™s statements to his customers were false.  P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no relationship to CoreCap Investments.  Romer did not invest the customers™ money in the stock market for their benefit.  He instead stole the money for his own personal use.  Romer commingled approximately $2.7 million of customer funds with his advances from CoreCap Investments and other sources for a total of approximately $4.4 million.  Of that, Romer used approximately $3.5 million for trading in his personal brokerage accounts, paid approximately $714,000 to cover his personal expenses, paid approximately $343,000 to customers of his prior brokerage firms, paid approximately $302,000 to customers of CoreCap Investments, and transferred approximately $41,000 to family members.   4. By engaging in this conduct, Romer violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.   5. In connection with this lawsuit, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Romer to enjoin him from future violations of the above-cited provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC further seeks an order requiring Romer to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of the ill-gotten gains that he received through his fraud, along with the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t] and Section 21 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u].  Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.2    Page 2 of 10  - 3 - JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa].  Defendant Romer, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 7. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa] because certain of the acts, practices and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  In addition, during the relevant time period, Defendant Romer resided and conducted business within the Eastern District of Michigan. THE DEFENDANT 8. Ernest J. Romer, III is 57 years old and is a resident of Shelby Township, Michigan.  From October 2012 until his termination in January 2017, Romer was a registered representative associated with CoreCap Investments.  Romer held Series 7, 63 and 66 licenses.  CoreCap Investments terminated Romer in January 2017 for engaging in undisclosed outside business activities.  In July 2017, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) barred Romer in all capacities from association with any FINRA members.  In August of 2017, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10  - 4 - Affairs (ﬁLARAﬂ) revoked Romer™s securities agent registration, barring Romer from registration with a broker-dealer.   FACTS Romer™s Professional Background  9. Romer has been a registered representative associated with various broker-dealers since at least 1993.  Many of his customers followed Romer from broker-dealer to broker-dealer.  In 2012, Romer began working for CoreCap Investments. Romer™s Offering Fraud and Misappropriation Scheme  10. In 2014, Romer began recommending that certain of his CoreCap Investments customers sell securities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts in the name of either P&R Capital or CoreCap Solutions.  Romer represented that he would use the funds to make investments which would earn better returns than their current investments.  Romer told some customers he would invest their funds in a variable annuity and told others he would invest in stocks or mutual funds.  Based on Romer™s representations, including Romer™s installation of misleading signage directly behind the reception desk in the CoreCap Investments branch office where he worked that read ﬁCoreCap Solutions,ﬂ the customers understood that P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were affiliated with CoreCap Investments.    11. Many of Romer™s customers were elderly retirees and unsophisticated investors.  They had most of their life savings invested with Romer.  Based on their decades-long relationship, the customers trusted Romer and agreed to sell securities and transfer their funds as Romer recommended. Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10  - 5 -  12. Based on Romer™s recommendations, from approximately 2014 to April 2016, customers sold securities in their CoreCap Investments account, transferred the proceeds to their personal bank accounts, and then wrote personal checks or provided cashier™s checks to P&R Capital or CoreCap Solutions.  Romer deposited those checks into P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions bank accounts, over which he had sole control.  13. In April 2016, Romer began instructing customers to transfer money directly from their CoreCap Investments accounts to the P&R Capital bank account.  In those instances, Romer completed all the required paperwork, had the customers sign it, and then sent it to CoreCap Investments™ back office for processing.    14. In total, approximately 22 customers sent $1,962,887 to P&R Capital and 11 customers sent $738,200 to CoreCap Solutions. Romer™s Misappropriation of Customer Funds  15. Contrary to Romer™s representations, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no relationship to CoreCap Investments, and the customers™ money was not used to purchase securities for the customers.    16. Instead, Romer used another joint checking account in his name to commingle the $2.7 million he raised from his customers with approximately $1.0 million in advances that he received from CoreCap Investments, approximately $495,000 in cashier™s checks, and approximately $242,000 from other sources.  Romer used approximately $3.5 million for trading in his personal brokerage accounts, realizing trading losses, primarily from options trading, of about $3.1 million.  Romer also used approximately $714,000 of the commingled funds for personal expenses, including mortgage payments, credit cards bills, shopping, college costs for his children, Detroit Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10  - 6 - Lions tickets, and cash withdrawals.  Additionally, Romer transferred approximately $41,000 to family members.   17. From the time Romer began misappropriating his customers™ funds, he used some of their money to repay other customers at one of his former brokerage firms, who had suffered losses in a private offering in 2010 and 2011.  Eventually, Romer used approximately $343,000 of his customers™ funds for this fraudulent purpose.   18. Some of Romer™s CoreCap Investments customers requested that he return some of their funds.  He used funds from other CoreCap Investments customers to make those payments.  In total, Romer made approximately $302,000 of such Ponzi-like payments, using money he received from his victims.   19. Romer never disclosed to his CoreCap Investments customers that he would use, or had used, their funds for any of the purposes described in Paragraphs 16-18, above.   20. Romer acted deliberately, with the intent to deceive.  He never intended to make the investments he promised to his customers, and he never invested any of the money he raised from his customers for their benefit.   21. As a result of Romer™s false and misleading statements, at least 30 customers transferred at least $2.7 million to Romer.  Uncovering Romer™s Fraud  22. As early as mid-2015, some of Romer™s customers began to question him about their investment returns and tax documentation.  Romer was unable to provide the customers with any documentation relating to the investments because none of the money had been invested as promised.  Instead, Romer told his customers various lies, including Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.6    Page 6 of 10  - 7 - that their money was safe and that he was waiting for better buying opportunities or market movement before investing on their behalf.   23. Eventually, certain of Romer™s customers complained to the local criminal authorities.  In September 2017, Romer was charged with embezzlement by the Macomb County Prosecutor™s Office.  In July 2018, he pled no contest to those charges, and is currently awaiting sentencing.

Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC. Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments. Based on Romer's misrepresentations, the customers believed that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with a broker-dealer where he worked. Romer's alleged statements to his customers were false. As alleged in the complaint, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer's personal businesses, and Romer did not invest the customers' money in the stock market for their benefit. He allegedly stole the money and used it to benefit himself and his family, to conduct trading in his own brokerage account, to make Ponzi-like payments to other customers, and to repay customers from his prior brokerage firm who had suffered losses on an investment Romer had recommended.The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Romer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Romer to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Wilburn Saylor of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Steven Klawans. The litigation will be led by John E. Birkenheier and Ms. Key-Patterson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Macomb County, Michigan Prosecutor's Office."
8,"IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA                  § SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, §         § Plaintiff,      §         § v.        § Case No. __________            §  1POOL LTD. a.k.a. 1BROKER and   § PATRICK BRUNNER,     §         §   Defendants.      §         §  COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ), for its Complaint against Defendants 1pool Ltd. a.k.a. 1Broker (ﬁ1Brokerﬂ) and Patrick Brunner (ﬁBrunnerﬂ) (collectively, ﬁDefendantsﬂ), alleges: SUMMARY 1. From at least 2012 until September 2018, the Defendants have illegally offered and sold security-based swaps to U.S. investors through their website 1broker.com while failing to file a registration statement with the SEC.  As 1Broker™s CEO and sole shareholder, Brunner controls 1Broker and its operations.  He is also the developer of the 1broker.com platform. 2. On the 1broker.com website, the Defendants market the security-based swaps as ﬁCFDsﬂŠwhich is an acronym for ﬁcontracts for difference.ﬂ  Through these CFDs, 1Broker accountholders can participate in the price movements of securities and other assets without actually owning the underlying asset.  For example, an accountholder can purchase a long or short position in a CFD that tracks the price of the stock of a publicly-traded U.S. company.  Then, depending on whether the stock price goes up or down, the value of the CFD will also go Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 1 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 2 Complaint up or down.  1Broker is the counterparty on every CFD, meaning it takes the opposite position of the accountholder on every CFD.  For example, if the accountholder takes a long position, 1Broker takes the corresponding short position. 3. Because the values of the CFDs are tied to the values of underlying securities, market indices, or other financial assets or benchmarks, they are security-based swaps under the federal securities laws.  Absent certain exceptions (which do not apply here), the federal securities laws require that offerings in security-based swaps be registered with the SEC and that the transactions be executed on a registered national exchange.  Likewise, 1BrokerŠwhich acted as a dealer in the CFDsŠwas required to register with the SEC.  Because neither the CFDs nor 1Broker was registered and because the transactions were not executed on a national exchange, the Defendants violated the federal securities laws.  Brunner, who controlled 1Broker and directed its activities, was a culpable participant in 1Broker™s violations.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The SEC brings this action under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], seeking to permanently restrain and enjoin the Defendants from engaging in the unlawful acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein. 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 22(a) and (c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77v(a) and (c)] and Section 27(a)-(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 6. The Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails or of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, or courses of business described in this Complaint. Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 2 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 3 Complaint 7. Venue is proper because the transactions, acts, practices, and/or courses of business described below occurred within the District of Columbia. PARTIES 8. Plaintiff SEC is an agency of the United States of America charged with enforcing the federal securities laws. 9. Defendant Brunner, age 26, resides principally in Austria.  He is 1Broker™s CEO, sole shareholder, and the only person authorized to represent the company.   He also developed 1Broker™s software platform. 10. Defendant 1Broker is a limited liability company registered as 1pool Ltd. in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Although the entity was registered in 2015, Brunner and 1Broker have utilized and maintained the 1broker.com website since 2012. FACTS A. The Defendants offer security-based swaps to U.S. investors. 11. Since at least 2012, the Defendants have offered CFDs through their 1broker.com website, which is publicly available to anyone in the U.S. with internet access.  Using the website, a person can open an account by simply providing an email address and creating a user name.  Accountholders are not required to provide any additional informationŠsuch as full legal name, address, purpose of account, source of funds, etc. 12. In order to buy and sell CFDs, accountholders must first fund their accounts.  Only one form of funding is acceptedŠthe digital currency Bitcoin.  Likewise, all payments made by 1Broker to accountholders are made in bitcoins. 13. Once an account is funded, the accountholder can trade CFDs.  The value of the CFDs is based on the value of corresponding assets.  These assets include U.S. exchange-listed Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 3 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 4 Complaint stocks, commodities, and foreign-exchange pairs.  As explained on the 1broker.com website: ﬁ[u]nlike with options or other complex instruments the CFD price is one to one with the underlying market.  You can trade them virtually feeless and faster than shares, options or futures.ﬂ  1broker.com also states that it provides accountholders ﬁa selection of various current trade rates of certain securities [–and t]he depiction of these Markets is based on current data from the exchanges and is updated on an ongoing basis.ﬂ 14. When trading the CFDs, accountholders select whether they want to take a long or short position.  Accountholders who purchase a ﬁlongﬂ CFD profit if the price of the corresponding asset or index increases.  Accountholders who purchase a ﬁshortﬂ CFD profit if the price of the corresponding investment decreases.  Like stocks on publicly-traded exchanges, all purchases and sales of CFDs are subject to a bid-ask spreadŠdescribed as a ﬁone-time feeﬂ that 1Broker collects on transactions. 15. 1Broker also uses stock exchange terminology and provides broker-dealer functionality for opening and closing investment positions.  For example, 1broker.com includes a page labeled ﬁMarkets.ﬂ  Within the Markets page, accountholders are presented with a series of choicesŠincluding Indices, Stocks, Commodities, Forex, and Crypto.  Within these markets, accountholders can choose to trade individual CFDs that fall within these categories. 16. If an accountholder selects a stock from the menu of choices on 1broker.com, 1Broker provides various information about that company™s stock.  This includes the U.S. exchange ticker symbol, real-time bid and ask prices quoted in U.S. dollars, maximum leverage amount, a stock price chart, and buttons labeled ﬁLongﬂ and ﬁShort.ﬂ  1Broker offers a wide array of CFDs with corresponding U.S.-based equities.  For example, an accountholder Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 4 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 5 Complaint considering a CFD in Bank of America Corp. common stock would see a screen that looks similar to this:  17. 1Broker acts as the counterparty on every CFD trade.  This means that when an accountholder takes a position in a CFD, 1Broker takes the other side of the trade (e.g., if an accountholder takes a long position in a stock, 1Broker takes the corresponding short position). 18. The CFDs are security-based swaps as defined by the federal securities laws.  The Securities Act and the Exchange Act define a ﬁsecurity-based swapﬂ in relevant part as any agreement, contract, or transaction that is based on a single security or the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or extent of an occurrence of an event relating to a single issuer of a security, provided that such event directly affects the financial statements, financial condition, or financial obligations of the issuer.  See 15 U.S.C § 77b(a)(17); 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(68); 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18).    Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 5 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 6 Complaint B. The Defendants illegally offer the CFDs without registering with the SEC. 19. In order to protect investors, the federal securities laws require that securities offerings be registered with the SEC (absent an exemption).  For the same reason, absent an exemption, securities dealers are required to register with the SEC.  The Defendants failed to comply with these registration requirements. 20. Security-based swaps are securities under the federal securities laws.  As detailed above, the CFDsŠwhich have their value tied to stocksŠare security-based swaps.  They are also, therefore, securitiesŠand may not be offered or sold in the U.S. unless a registration statement has been filed with the SEC.  The Defendants failed to file a registration statement. 21. 1Broker offered and sold these security-based swaps through 1broker.com.  Investors from across the worldŠincluding the U.S.Šhad access to the website.  Although 1Broker and Brunner had the ability to restrict users™ access to the website, as they did with Austrian investors, they continued to offer and sell these security-based swaps on the 1broker.com platform.  Brunner created the platform for the offer and sale, and personally corresponded with investors about the company and specific aspects of the CFDs.   22. U.S. investors traded the CFDs through 1broker.com.  For example, a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity (the ﬁUC Agentﬂ), accessed the 1broker.com website while physically located in Houston, Texas and opened an account by providing only an email address and password.  The UC Agent then funded the account using bitcoins.  Later, while physically located in Washington, D.C., the UC Agent logged into 1broker.com and bought and sold CFDs that track the price of the common stock of Ford Motor Company. Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 6 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 7 Complaint 23. The UC Agent made all of the following trades at 1broker.com:1 Date Time (EST) CFD Action Location 03/30/2016 11:25:17AM WU Buy Houston 03/30/2016 11:28:14AM WU Sell Houston 03/30/2016 11:34:02AM WU Buy Houston 03/31/2016 10:15:46AM WU Sell Houston 05/03/2016 2:28:33PM GPRO Buy Houston 05/03/2016 3:07:57PM GPRO Sell Houston 07/05/2016 11:33:24AM GPRO Buy Houston 07/05/2016 3:49:09PM GPRO Sell Houston 12/12/2016 2:14:24PM F Buy D.C. 12/12/2016 2:38:40PM F Sell D.C. 12/13/2016 9:31:06AM F Buy D.C. 12/13/2016 11:29:24AM F Sell D.C.     24. 1Broker and Brunner did not determine whether accountholders met certain discretionary trading thresholds. The unregistered sale of security-based swaps is legal when the sales are limited to ﬁeligible contract participantsﬂŠwhich are high-net-worth individuals and certain types of sophisticated and/or regulated entities.  The sales of 1Broker CFDs were not so limited.  25. Similarly, the CFD transactions were not effected on a registered national securities exchange, as required.  Instead, all of the sales took place through the 1broker.com websiteŠwhich is not registered in the U.S. 26. Finally, 1Broker illegally operates as an unregistered dealer.  The federal securities laws require that any dealer register with the SEC.  A dealer is any person (including an entity) engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for the person™s own account.  Although certain exemptions apply to security-based swaps dealers, because 1Broker dealt in                                                  1 The UC Agent took a long position in each of these trades.  The CFD ticker symbols are: The Western Union Company (WU), GoPro Inc. (GPRO), and Ford Motor Company.  Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 7 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 8 Complaint security-based swaps with non-eligible contract participants, it cannot avail itself of this exemption. 27. Because it participated in every transaction as the counterparty, 1Broker was in the business of buying and selling CFDs for its own account. 1Broker charged a ﬁfeeﬂ on each transaction in the form of a bid-ask spread.   Thousands of accountholders, including U.S investors, have utilized 1Broker™s platform to transact in millions of dollars of bitcoin across their 1Broker trading accounts.  28. In addition, 1Broker describes itself as the ﬁmarket makerﬂ for the CFDs. 29. Despite the fact that it was acting as a dealer, 1Broker failed to register with the SEC.  In failing to do so, it violated the federal securities laws. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF First Claim Violations of Section 5(e) of the Securities Act  30. The SEC re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-29 by reference as if set forth fully herein. 31. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, in the absence of any applicable exception, made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails, to offer to sell, offer to buy or purchase or sell, a security-based swap to persons who are not eligible contract participants as defined in Section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act, without an effective registration statement. Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 8 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 9 Complaint 32. Consequently, the Defendants have violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 5(e) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e(e)]. Second Claim Violations of Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act  33. The SEC re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-29 by reference as if set forth fully herein. 34. Defendant 1Broker effected transactions in security-based swaps with or for a person that is not an eligible contract participant, without such transaction being effected on a national securities exchange registered pursuant to subsection Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78f(b)]. 35. Because Defendant Brunner, directly or indirectly, controls 1Broker, he is also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as 1Broker pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)]. 36. Consequently, the Defendants violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78f(l)]. Third Claim Violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act  37. The SEC re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-29 by reference as if set forth fully herein. 38. Defendant 1Broker made use of the mails or means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect transactions in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempted security or commercial paper, bankers™ acceptances, or commercial bills) without being registered in accordance with Exchange Act Section 15(b) [15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)]. Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1   Filed 09/27/18   Page 9 of 11 SEC v. 1Broker     Page 10 Complaint 39. Because Defendant Brunner, directly or indirectly, controls 1Broker, he is also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as 1Broker pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)]. 40. Consequently, the Defendants violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1)]. RELIEF REQUESTED The SEC respectfully requests that this Court enter a judgment: A. Permanently enjoining the Defendants from violating Section 5(e) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(e)] and Sections 6(l) and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78f(l) and 15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1)]. B. Ordering the Defendants to disgorge, on a joint and several basis, an amount equal to the funds and benefits they obtained illegally, or to which they are otherwise not entitled, as a result of the violations alleged, plus prejudgment interest thereon. C. Imposing civil penalties upon the Defendants pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. D. Ordering such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.

P. 4 (l))0.00Case 1:18-cv-02244   Document 1-3   Filed 09/27/18   Page 2 of 2","The Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against an international securities dealer and its Austria-based CEO for allegedly violating the federal securities laws in connection with security-based swaps funded with bitcoins.According to the SEC's complaint, 1pool Ltd. a/k/a 1Broker, registered in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and its CEO Patrick Brunner solicited investors from the United States and around the world to buy and sell security-based swaps. Investors could open accounts by simply providing an email address and a user name - no additional information was required - and could only fund their account using bitcoins. The SEC alleges that a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity, successfully purchased several security-based swaps on 1Broker's platform from the U.S. despite not meeting the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws. The SEC also alleges that Brunner and 1Broker failed to transact its security-based swaps on a registered national exchange, and failed to properly register as a dealer.The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges 1Broker and Brunner with violating registration provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 5(e) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 6(l) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties. In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced charges against 1Broker arising from similar conduct.The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Hirsch and Morgan Ward Doran, and supervised by Scott Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Chris Davis and supervised by B. David Fraser. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the CFTC.Note: This litigation release was amended on November 21, 2019, to clarify the SEC's charges."

November 19, 2018, a U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered final judgments on consent against defendants Edward and Jean Chen, husband and wife, and five entity defendants who had been charged with defrauding Chinese investors in connection with the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program.On September 20, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against Edward and Jean Chen, Home Paradise Investment Center LLC, GH Investment LP, GH Design Group LLC, Golden Galaxy LP, and Mega Home LLC, alleging that the Chens, through the entities they controlled, raised more than $22.5 million from 45 investors in China for the development of an interior design center and an 80-unit condominium building. The complaint alleged that the Chens misappropriated and misused more than $12 million of investors' funds by purchasing residential real estate unrelated to the two EB-5 projects. The SEC's complaint further alleged that the Chens and their companies provided investors a fake lease for the interior design center that replaced the name of the true lessor with a Chen-controlled entity and overstated the true size of the leased space five-fold.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments resolving all claims. The final judgments enjoin defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and further enjoin Edward and Jean Chen from participating in the offer or sale of any security which constitutes an investment in a ""commercial enterprise"" under the USCIS EB-5 visa program. The final judgments also order Edward and Jean Chen, GH Investment LP, GH Design Group LLC, Golden Galaxy LP, and Mega Home LLC to pay, on a joint and several basis, disgorgement of $24,655,000, with prejudgment interest of $1,173,098. The final judgments also order Edward and Jean Chen to pay civil penalties of $1,077,500 each. The disgorgement amount represents $22.5 million in capital contributions and $2.155 million in administrative fees the defendants received from the investors, and is subject to an offset for any amounts that may be distributed to the defrauded investors by the court-appointed receiver. Additionally, the final judgments order Home Paradise Investment Center LLC to pay, on a joint and several basis with the other defendants, disgorgement of $2.155 million, with prejudgment interest of $119,583, which has been deemed satisfied by amounts already collected and to be distributed to the investors by the receiver."

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") \'Ł' 1 ' ' , .Ł , .. ,: "" ii .; Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.1   Page 1 of 30 1 2 1. () SUMMARY Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") brings this 3 emergency action to halt an ongoing investment fraud involving an upcoming initial 4 coin offering (""ICO"") by defendant Block.vest LLC (""Blockvest"") and its founder and 5 principal, Reginald Buddy Ringgold, III, aka Rasool Abdul Rahim El (""Ringgold""). 6 Block.vest, which purports to be the ""first [U.S.] licensed and regulated tokenized 7 crypto currency exchange and index fund"" (emphasis added), claims that it has 8 already raised more than $2.5 million in pre-I CO sales of its BL V digital tokens 9 (""BL Vs""), and that it will raise $100 million during its ICO, purportedly to fund 10 Block.vest's digital asset-related financial products and services. 11 2. Blockvest and Ringgold claim their ICO has been ""registered"" and 12 ""approved"" by the SEC and other regulators, even going so far as to use the SEC's 13 seal to promote their offering. None of that is true: the SEC has in no way approved, 14 authorized or otherwise endorsed defendants, their entities, nor their ICO. 15 Defendants also claim they are ""partnered"" with and ""audited by"" Deloitte Touche 16 Tohmatsu Limited (""Deloitte"")-which they are not. 17 3. To carry out this scheme, Ringgold created a fictitious regulatory 18 agency, the ""Blockchain Exchange Commission,"" or ""BEC,"" which he claims 19 ""regulates"" the ""Blockchain Digital Asset Space,"" supposedly to ""protect"" digital 20 asset investors. But the BEC is not a regulator at all. It falsely conjures similarities 21 to the SEC: its logo is similar to the SEC's; its mission statement is cribbed from the 22 SEC's own; and its offices share the same address as SEC headquarters. The 23 Block.vest website links directly from the BEC seal to the SEC's website. Ringgold 24 promotes the Blockvest offering and the BEC side-by-side, further conveying a false 25 veneer of legitimacy to the Blockvest ICO. 26 4. In reality, defendants have neither the regulatory ""approvals,"" nor the 27 established business relationships they claim. The BL V offering is not ""U.S. SEC 28 2 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.2   Page 2 of 30 () () 1 approved,"" nor approved by any other U.S. financial regulator. The BEC has no 2 affiliation with the SEC, and Blockvest is not affiliated with the name-brand 3 companies whose logos appear in its marketing materials. Investors' assets therefore 4 lack the safety or protections that defendants are falsely portraying in their ongoing 5 scheme to raise money through Blockvest's planned ICO and ongoing pre-sales. 6 5. Unless restrained and enjoined, Ringgold is scheduled to appear at 7 two ""VCs, Angels, Crypto and ICOs"" events in Los Angeles on October 9, 2018 8 and in Orange County on October 11, 2018, where he will likely continue 9 promoting Blockvest and the BEC in order to raise additional monies from 10 investors through his fraudulent misrepresentations and scheme to defraud-11 including for Blockvest's intended December 2018 ICO. 12 6. By lying to investors and perpetrating a fraudulent scheme through the 13 Blockvest ICO, each of the defendants is violating the antifraud provisions of 14 Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section lO(b) of 15 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule lOb-5 thereunder, 16 as well as the securities offering registration provisions of Section 5 of the 1 7 Securities Act. 18 7. The SEC seeks orders temporarily, preliminarily and permanently 19 enjoining defendants from violating the securities laws; an order temporarily, 20 preliminarily and permanently enjoining Ringgold from participating in an offering 21 of digital or other securities or making misrepresentations regarding regulatory 22 approval in connection with such offerings; orders freezing defendants' assets; 23 requiring accountings from defendants; and prohibiting the destruction of 24 documents; as well as disgorgement of defendants' ill-gotten gains and civil 25 monetary penalties against defendants. 26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 27 28 8. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b ), 3 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 30 (! (! 1 20(d)(l), and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(l), and 2 77v(a), and Sections 21(d)(l), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 3 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(l), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e), and 78aa(a). 4 9. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or 5 instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a 6 national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, 7 and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 8 10. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the 9 Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 10 U.S.C. § 78aa(a), because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of 11 conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this 12 district. In addition, venue is proper in this district because defendant Ringgold 13 resides in this district and defendant Blockvest has its principal place of business in 14 this district. 15 THE DEFENDANTS 16 11. Blockvest LLC was formed in Wyoming in April 2018 and is based 17 in San Diego. It is a private company that purports to provide various digital asset-18 related financial products and services, for which it is raising funds through the 19 sale of BL Vs. Blockvest uses the website www.blockvestico.io. Blockvest is not 20 and has never been registered with the SEC in any capacity.

() 1 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 2 A. Background on Initial Coin Offerings 3 18. An initial coin offering or ""ICO"" is a fundraising event in which an 4 entity offers participants a unique ""coin"" or ""token"" or ""digital asset,"" in exchange 5 for consideration, often in the form of virtual currency-most commonly Bitcoin 6 and Ether-or fiat currency. 7 19. The digital assets are issued on a ""blockchain"" or cryptographically 8 secured ledger. 9 20. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database 10 spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically 11 unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains 12 a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the 13 previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on 14 cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can 15 be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Bitcoin 16 blockchain is an example of a ""non-permissioned,"" or public and open access 17 blockchain. Anyone can download the Bitcoin open-source software and join. All 18 participants share a single view of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is updated when 19 Bitcoin network participants reach a consensus on the validity of transactions 20 under review. ""Permissioned"" or private blockchains are modifications to that 21 model and require permissioned servers to be approved to participate on the 22 network or to access particular information on the blockchain. Blockchains or 23 distributed ledgers can also record what are called smart contracts, which 24 essentially are computer programs designed to execute the terms of a contract 25 when certain triggering conditions are met. 26 21. Generally, digital assets issued in an ICO entitle holders to certain 27 rights related to a venture underlying the ICO, such as rights to profits, shares of 28 7 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.7   Page 7 of 30 () (! 1 assets, rights to use certain services provided by the issuer, and/or voting 2 rights. These digital assets may also be listed on online platforms, often called 3 virtual currency exchanges, and tradeable for virtual or fiat currencies. Often, the 4 digital assets are immediately tradeable. 5 22. ICOs are typically announced and promoted through public online 6 channels. Issuers usually release a ""whitepaper"" describing the offering and the 7 terms of the ICO. To participate, investors are generally required to transfer funds 8 (often virtual currency) to the issuer's address, online wallet, or other 9 account. After the completion of the ICO, the issuer distributes its unique digital 10 assets, commonly known as ""tokens,"" to the participants' unique addresses on the 11 blockchain. 12 23. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued a Report of Investigation pursuant 13 to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act that put the digital-asset industry on notice 14 that many digital assets are securities and subject to the federal securities laws and 15 the registration requirements, regardless of whether the issuing entity is a 16 traditional company or a distributed ledger or blockchain-enabled means of capital 17 raising, regardless of whether the securities are purchased with U.S. dollars or 18 virtual currencies, and regardless of whether the securities are distributed in 19 certificated form or through distributed ledger technology. 20 B. The Blockvest Pre-Sales and ICO 21 1. Blockvest's purported business 22 24. Blockvest purports to be a financial services company that, using 23 blockchain technology, ""aims to solve one of the biggest problems in the 24 cryptocurrency industry-volatility"" as well as the ""problems of trust and 25 custodianship."" 26 25. In or around February 2018, Blockvest issued a whitepaper, available 27 on its webpage, for the sale of BL Vs, which purport to be digital assets issued 28 8 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.8   Page 8 of 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 (! pursuant to a smart contract developed using the Ethereum Blockchain. 26. According to the whitepaper and the Blockvest website, Blockvest is developing four products, which will be funded by its planned ICO: a. ""Blockvest30"": purportedly a cryptocurrency index fund managed by BIG, using a ""proprietary trading strategy for trading all asset classes·"" ' b. ""Yields"": purportedly a digital currency described as a ""stablecoin,"" supposedly linked to the U.S. dollar, and also described as a ""digidend;"" c. The ""Blockvest Interface"": purportedly an automated ""investment portfolio structuring and management"" tool; and d. The ""Blockvest Decentralized Exchange"" or ""DEX"": purportedly ""a Bloomberg for crypto economics"" on which BL V holders will have the ability to track digital asset prices, follow market news, and acquire and sell digital assets through other ""major cryptocurrency exchanges."" 27. Based on Blockvest's website, none of the foregoing products are yet operational; Blockvest showed a demo version of the DEX at an August 2018 digital assets conference. 28. Blockvest's website and whitepaper reflect that it will receive certain services from BIG, Rosegold, and MIG. 2. Defendants' promotions and sales of the BL Vs 29. Blockvest first issued BL Vs, priced at $1 per token, in a transfer dated March 30, 2018. 30. Since March 30, 2018, Blockvest has been conducting BLV sales in 26 two tranches: (1) a ""private sale"" with a 50o/o bonus that ran through April 30, 27 2018; and (2) an ongoing ""pre-ICO"" or ""Testing the Waters Phase"" with a 20% 28 9 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.9   Page 9 of 30 (! \ ( I 1 bonus from July 1, 2018 through October 6, 2018. These sales lead up to a ""global 2 ICO"" that is planned for December 1, 2018. 3 31. Between early 2018 and the present, Blockvest also has conducted 4 several ""bounty programs,"" giving BL Vs in exchange for favorable social media 5 posts concerning the company, which have been advertised on Blockvest's social 6 media accounts. 7 32. According to Blockvest's website and whitepaper, Blockvest has 8 capped the supply of BL Vs at 100 million, with plans to issue 50 million of the 9 tokens during the pre-ICO and ICO. 10 33. Also according to the website and whitepaper, the company will issue 11 32.5 million of the tokens to investors, setting aside 10 million for management, 5 12 million for ""Core Activities Reserves,"" and 2.5 million for promotional incentives. 13 34. The company also claims on its website and whitepaper that it is 14 planning an initial public offering, or IPO, (separate from the ICO) of unspecified 15 securities in 2019. 16 35. Since early 2018, Blockvest has been promoting its pre-ICO and ICO 17 through Blockvest's whitepaper, the websites for Blockvest, BIG, and Ringgold, 18 and social media accounts held by Blockvest and Ringgold. 19 36. Also since early 2018, Ringgold has been appearing at various 20 blockchain conferences to tout Blockvest, and posting videos of these appearances 21 online. 22 37. On or about May 8, 2018, Blockvest claimed on social media 23 channels to have raised $2.5 million through the sale of BL Vs, within seven days 24 of the commencement of the pre-ICO sales. 25 38. By on or about September 17, 2018, Blockvest represented on its 26 website that it had sold 18% of the BL Vs being offered, or roughly 9 million 27 tokens. 28 10 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.10   Page 10 of 30 (! ( ) 1 39. Ethereum Blockchain data reflects that between March 30 and 2 September 26, 2018, Blockvest issued over 10 million tokens in 266 transfers. 3 4 3. Blockvest's and Ringgold's concessions that BL Vs are securities 5 40. Blockvest's Form D filing with the SEC, its promotional materials, 6 and Ringgold's public statements reflect defendants' understanding that BL Vs are 7 securities. 8 41. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act, any offer or sale of a security 9 must either be registered with the SEC or meet an exemption. Securities Act 10 Regulation D [17 C.F.R. §§ 230.500 et seq.] provides a number of exemptions 11 from the registration requirements, allowing some companies to offer and sell their 12 securities without having to register the offering with the SEC. 13 42. When relying on such an exemption, companies must file what is 14 known as a ""Form D"" after they first sell their securities. Form Dis a brief notice 15 that includes basic information about the company and the offering. 16 43. One of the exemptions provided for in Regulation D, Rule 506(c), 17 provides that a company can broadly solicit and generally advertise the offering 18 and still be deemed to be in compliance with the exemption's requirements if: (1) 19 the investors in the offering are all accredited investors; and (2) the company takes 20 reasonable steps to verify that the investors are accredited investors. 21 44. On April 16, 2018, Blockvest filed a Form D for a $100 million dollar 22 securities offering of BL Vs, claiming an exemption from registration under 23 Securities Act Regulation D, Rule 506( c ). 24 45. On information and belief, Blockvest does not take reasonable steps to 25 ensure that BL V investors are accredited. 26 46. Although Blockvest filed a Form D with the SEC for a Regulation D 27 registration exemption, its website instead invokes Securities Act Regulation A. 28 11 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.11   Page 11 of 30 (! () 1 47. SEC Regulation A [17 C.F.R. §§ 230.251 et seq.] constitutes an 2 exemption from Section 5 registration and is limited to eligible issuers as defined 3 in the regulation. On March 25, 2015, the SEC amended Regulation A pursuant to 4 Section 401 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of2012 [15 U.S.C. 5 § 77c(b)(2)-(5)). Section 401 directed the SEC to adopt rules expanding the 6 previous Regulation A by, among other things, exempting public offerings of up to 7 $50 million annually (Regulation A, as amended, is commonly known as 8 ""Regulation A+""). 9 48. Under Regulation A, issuers must comply with different regulatory 10 requirements depending on whether the offering is a Tier 1 offering for up to $20 11 million in proceeds or a Tier 2 offering for up to $50 million. In either case, no sale 12 of a security may occur under Regulation A until ( 1) the issuer has filed an offering 13 statement on Form 1-A with the Commission and (2) the Commission has issued a 14 notice of qualification. 15 49. Block.vest's website states (falsely) that ""[t]he company is now SEC 16 Reg A+ compliant and can offer their securities offering to Unaccredited 17 Investors all over the globe."" (Emphasis added.) 18 50. Likewise, on or about June 23, 2018, Ringgold claimed during a 19 presentation at the ""Blockchain Economic Forum"" (""BE Forum""), a video of 20 which he posted online, ""Since we got our Reg A, we are able to take on investors 21 from pretty much everywhere for any amount. They don't have to be accredited."" 22 (Emphasis added.) 23 51. Blockvest has not filed a Form 1-A offering statement for a 24 Regulation A securities offering, nor has any offering been qualified by SEC staff 25 as required by Regulation A. 26 52. On or about July 29, 2018, Ringgold stated during a presentation at 27 the ""Digital Currency Con"" (""DC Con""), a video of which he posted online: ""The 28 12 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.12   Page 12 of 30 (! (! 1 SEC says it's a security so we registered with the SEC."" 2 4. Representations regarding expected profits and income 3 from the efforts of Blockvest, BIG, and their management 4 53. Blockvest's whitepaper and online materials represent that the 5 Blockvest30 and other Blockvest products and services will provide returns based 6 on the purported skill ofBlockvest's and BIG's management. 7 54. For example, Blockvest's website and other online materials highlight 8 the supposed decades of financial industry experience of a 21-person management 9 team. 10 55. In particular, the posted biography for ""Prof. Ringgold"" claims he 11 ""[ o ]verses all aspects of operations and important strategic decisions for [BIG]."" 12 56. Blockvest's Facebook page claims Ringgold has ""over 17+ years of 13 experience in the financial markets and has been a full-time financial trader for 14 several years trading the European, US and Asian markets."" (The post does not 15 allude to Ringgold's age, which is 34). 16 57. Blockvest's whitepaper emphasizes BIG's ""proprietary trading 17 strategy"" as the driver of steady profits for the Blockvest30, and states that 18 ""Blockchain Investments targets returns between 12% to 25% per annum."" 19 58. Blockvest' s online materials also promise that BL V holders will share 20 in the profits of the Blockvest30 and other ventures. 21 59. For example, Blockvest's whitepaper states, ""As a Blockvest token 22 holder, your Blockvest will generate a pro-rated share of50% of the profit 23 generated quarterly as well as fees for processing transactions."" 24 60. The whitepaper also states that, ""The BL V token is a novel 25 decentralized asset, whose intrinsic value is derived from the fees generated in the 26 network it collateralizes as well as the right to receive quarterly earnings from the 27 performance of the Blockchain Investments Fund."" 28 13 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.13   Page 13 of 30 () ( ) 1 61. Blockvest's website states that ""[s]imilar to a mutual fund, BlockVest 2 [sic] is a closed-end hybrid fund with a profit-sharing smart contract that pays 3 quarterly digital dividends."" 4 62. Next to the logo for Vanguard Investments (""Vanguard""), which was 5 used without the knowledge or permission of Vanguard, Blockvest's website states 6 that, ""Similar to a mutual fund[,] Blockvest is a closed-end hybrid fund with a 7 profit-sharing smart contract that pays quarterly digital dividends."" 8 63. Further, Blockvest' s promotional materials state that BL V investors 9 will earn ""passive"" income simply by holding their BL Vs in Blockvest's digital 10 wallets, referred to as ""Investomodes"" or ""Nvestnodes."" 11 64. For example, Blockvest's website states: ""Blockvest Nvestnodes 12 generate passive income through asset backed profit sharing smart contracts .... 13 The company is proud to introduce the Token-As-Fund business model, which 14 allows investors to subscribe to the fund's income stream."" 15 65. According to the Blockvest website, ""Simply holding 1000 BL V in an 16 Nvestnode generates passive income thru [sic] fees."" 17 18 c. Defendants' Material Misrepresentations and Omissions 1. False claims regarding regulatory approvals 19 66. Blockvest and Ringgold are falsely representing to investors that 20 Blockvest, the ICO, the Blockvest30, and/or the Blockvest DEX, have obtained· 21 regulatory ""approval,"" most notably misleading potential investors that Blockvest 22 and its ICO are ""approved"" by the SEC. 23 67. A reasonable investor in the Blockvest offering would consider 24 important the truth about the regulatory and registration status ofBlockvest, its 25 affiliates, and its ICO. 26 a. False claims regarding SEC ""approval"" 27 68. Since the Blockvest whitepaper was issued in February 2018 and 28 14 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.14   Page 14 of 30 () () 1 continuing through the present, Blockvest and Ringgold have falsely stated on 2 numerous instances that Blockvest, its planned products, or the ICO are 3 ""approved"" by the SEC. 4 69. Blockvest's whitepaper describes its ICO as an ""SEC Reg A+ 5 Securities Offering Approved."" (Emphasis added.) 6 70. Blockvest's website falsely states that: ""Blockvest is a U.S. SEC 7 approved platform that doubles as a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange as 8 well as a hedge fund."" (Emphasis added.) 9 71. Blockvest's public Facebook page likewise falsely states that: 10 ""Blockvest is a U.S. SEC approved platform .... "" (Emphasis added.) 11 72. Blockvest's website additionally reflects as a milestone in its 12 development the following: ""Blockvest DEX GETS SEC REG A+ APPROVAL 13 & PLANS TO 'TEST THE WATERS' WITH IPO."" (Emphasis added.) 14 73. In or about June 2018, Ringgold falsely stated at a blockchain 15 conference, the BE Forum: ""Good news, we just got our Reg A approval from the 16 SEC."" (Emphasis added.) 17 74. In or about July 2018, Ringgold falsely stated at another blockchain 18 conference, the DC Con: ""The SEC says it's a security so we registered with the 19 SEC' (emphasis added) and that: 20 ""Now, we have the 'JCO' -JOBS Crypto Offering -... a 21 combination of Reg A, Reg A+, a little sprinkle of Reg S. 22 It keeps you out [of] 'Reg Jail.""' 23 75. Blockvest, BIG, and Ringgold are not registered with the SEC in any 24 capacity. 25 76. The BL V offering, the Blockvest30, and the Blockvest DEX are not 26 registered with or ""approved"" by the SEC. 27 28 15 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.15   Page 15 of 30 (! (! 1 b. False claims regarding other regulatory approvals 2 77. Blockvest and Ringgold also are making numerous misleading 3 statements about supposed CFTC and National Futures Association (""NFA"") 4 approval, despite the NF A issuing a cease-and-desist letter to Blockvest on June 5 26, 2018. 6 78. The NF A is the industrywide, self-regulatory organization for the 7 United States derivatives industry. The NF A is designated by the CFTC as a 8 registered futures association. The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, 9 requires certain firms and individuals that conduct business in the derivatives 10 industry to register with the CFTC. CFTC regulations also require, with few 11 exceptions, CFTC-registered firms and individuals to be NF A members. The 12 CFTC has delegated registration responsibility to NF A. 13 79. Blockvest's website falsely states that: '""Under the helpful eye of the 14 CFTC and NF A, we look forward to providing certain qualified investors access 15 to this evolving market', the Fund will be managed by Blockchain Investment 16 Group, LLP, a commodity pool operator registered with the [CFTC] and a member 17 of the [NF A]."" (Emphasis added, internal quotes in original.) 18 80. While Blockvest was registered as a CTA in July 2018, BIG and the 19 similarly-named ""Blockchain Investment Group LLP"" have never been registered 20 as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. 21 81. Ringgold' s website states that Rosegold is ""a CFTC registered 22 Commodity Trading Advisor firm."" 23 82. Neither Rosegold nor Ringgold are registered with the CFTC in any 24 capacity. 25 83. Blockvest's website misrepresents that one of the company's 26 management members-""ChiefMarketing Strategist"" George B. Freeman-is 27 ""licensed with FINRA/NF A."" 28 16 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.16   Page 16 of 30 ( ) ( I 1 84. According to NF A and SEC records, Freeman has not been registered 2 with the CFTC since October 2014 and has never been registered with the SEC or 3 FINRA in any capacity. 4 85. On June 26, 2018, the NFA sent Blockvest a cease-and-desist letter 5 directing the company to stop to stop falsely claiming or implying membership 6 with or regulation by the NF A. 7 86. In particular, the letter demanded that Blockvest remove the language 8 on its website about being ""under the helpful eye of the CFTC and NF A"" and stop 9 its unauthorized and misleading use of the NF A logo. 10 87. The same date, Blockvest's chief financial officer emailed a response 11 to the NF A, stating that ""we intend to take every step to be fully compliant to NF A 12 membership requirements."" 13 88. As of this filing, however, Blockvest had not removed the NF A's 14 logo, the offending language about the regulators' ""helpful eye,"" nor the other 15 misleading representations about regulatory status on Blockvest's or Ringgold's 16 websites. 17 2. Fake affiliation with Deloitte 18 89. Blockvest and Ringgold also are falsely representing to investors that 19 Blockvest is associated with public accounting firm, Deloitte. 20 90. Blockvest's website falsely states that, ""Blockchain Investment Funds 21 will be Audited [sic} by Deloitte, as we plan to use Stratumn's Indigo Trace 22 platform this allows BLV Funds [sic] to become truly transparent."" (Emphasis 23 added.) 24 91. Blockvest and Ringgold also have disseminated online a video titled 25 ""ICO Overview,"" which falsely states that: "" ... we have partnered with Deloitte 26 and have built an innovative cryptographic audit technology."" (Emphasis added.) 27 92. Deloitte has no current or past business relationship with Blockvest or 28 17 Case 3:18-cv-02287-GPC-BLM   Document 1   Filed 10/03/18   PageID.17   Page 17 of 30 () ( ) 1 any related entities or individuals, including Ringgold, nor any knowledge of a 2 relationship between Deloitte and Blockvest or any related entities or indi","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting a planned initial coin offering (ICO), which backers falsely claimed was approved by the SEC. The order also halts ongoing pre-ICO sales by the company, Blockvest LLC and its founder, Reginald Buddy Ringgold, III.An SEC complaint unsealed yesterday alleges that Blockvest falsely claimed its ICO and its affiliates received regulatory approval from various agencies, including the SEC. According to the SEC's complaint, Blockvest and Ringgold, who also goes by the name Rasool Abdul Rahim El, were using the SEC seal without permission, a violation of federal law, and falsely claiming their crypto fund was ""licensed and regulated."" The complaint also alleges Ringgold promoted the ICO with a fake agency he created called the ""Blockchain Exchange Commission,"" using a graphic similar to the SEC's seal and the same address as SEC headquarters.Blockvest and Ringgold also allegedly misrepresented Blockvest's connections to a well-known accounting firm, and continued their fraudulent conduct even after the National Futures Association (NFA) sent them a cease-and-desist letter to stop them from using the NFA's seal and from making false claims about their status with that organization.The Honorable Gonzalo P. Curiel, Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, issued an order freezing defendants' assets and other emergency relief. The order also temporarily prohibits Blockvest and Ringgold from violating the antifraud provisions and securities registration provisions. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 18, 2018, to consider continuing the asset freeze and issuance of a preliminary injunction.The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Office of Customer Education and Outreach have jointly issued an investor alert on the use of false claims regarding SEC and CFTC endorsements. Additional information about ICOs is available on Investor.gov and SEC.gov/ICO.The SEC's complaint charges Blockvest and Ringgold with violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions under Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks injunctions, return of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties, and a bar against Ringgold to prohibit him from participating in offering any securities, including digital securities, in the future or making misrepresentations about regulatory approval.The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David S. Brown and Brent W. Wilner and is being supervised by Diana K. Tani and Joseph G. Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit, John W. Berry of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and Robert A.

(""RRC"") (collectively,""Defendants"") alleges as follows:INTRODUCTION1. This matter involves a fraudulent silver trading program operated by Rust andRRC. Since at least January 1, 2017, Rust has been soliciting investors to invest in a schemepurportedly involving the trading of silver bullion. 2. Rust has raised funds from approximately 300 investors across the country for thesilver trading program, and has been doing so since at least January 1, 2017. From that datethrough August 2018 alone, he may have raised approximately $85.7 million from investors inthe silver trading progam.3. Rust solicits investors by making material misrepresentations and omissions. Themisrepresentations about the silver trading program relate to, among others, the amount of silverhe maintains in safekeeping for investors at Brink's Global Services USA (""Brink's""); his silvertrading methods; his past performance; the use of investor funds; and the safety of theinvestment.4. In fact, Rust does not maintain any amount of silver in storage with Brink's; is notemploying the sophisticated silver trading strategies he advertises to investors; is not achievingthe returns he is representing to investors; and is putting investor funds at risk by spending themon his personal businesses and on himself and his family members.JURISDICTION AND VENUE5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction by authority of Sections 20 and 22 ofthe Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa.6. Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly and in concert, have made use of themeans and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the mails in connection with thetransactions, acts and courses of business alleged herein, certain of which have occurred withinthe District of Utah.7. Venue for this action is proper in the District of Utah under Section 22(a) of theSecurities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]2 because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in thisComplaint took place in this district and because Defendants reside in and transact business inthis district.8. Defendants, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to engagein the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein and in transactions,acts, practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object.9. Defendants' conduct took place in connection with the offer, purchase and/or saleof investment contracts issued by Rust, which are securities.DEFENDANTS10. Gaylen Dean Rust, 59 (""Rust""), is a resident of Layton, Utah. He is the presidentand sole director of RRC, and also controls a number of other businesses. Rust operates theRRC retail store in downtown Salt Lake City.11. Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (""RRC""), is a Utah corporation with its principal office inSalt Lake City, Utah. It was founded in 1966 by Rust's father and is operated by Rust. RRC'sretail store and website sells rare coins, collectible paper money and precious metal bullion. Thestore specializes in early Mormon currency. Its manager is Rust's son Joshua.STATEMENT OF FACTSBackground Šthe silver trading program12. In addition to managing the retail coin business of RRC, Rust solicits investors toplace their funds into a purported investment that is based on the purchase and sale of silverbullion (the ""silver trading program""). Rust tells investors that he trades only physical silver,rather than silver futures.13. The silver trading program is managed and controlled solely by Rust.3 14. Rust represents that he uses 100% of investor funds to buy silver. Rust tellsinvestors that he stores all the silver bullion that he has purchased with investor funds at Brink'sGlobal Services USA (""Brink's"") in either Salt Lake City or Los Angeles, with 85% of investorsilver being stored in Salt Lake City.15. Rust tells investors that he trades with only half the amount of silver he hasbought for the investor, storing the other half in safekeeping.16. In the fall of 2018, Rust told investors he was storing almost $80 million of silverat Brink's.17. Rust represents to investors that he conducts all of the silver trades for theprogram through an account in the name of RRC at HSBC Bank Plc (""HSBC""). He states thathe trades using an algorithm generated by HSBC that enables him to sell at the point when theprice of silver begins to fall and to buy the silver back just before the price recovers.18. Rust represents that he uses the profit he has generated in his trades to repurchasea larger amount of silver at the lower price, thereby continually increasing the amount of silverhe holds for the investor.19. Rust represents to investors that by using the HSBC algorithm he has neverexperienced a losing month, much less a losing year. He told one prospective investor that in hisworst year he had still earned 12% a year for his investors, and that he averaged returns of 20 to25% a year.20. Rust told one prospective investor that the only risk of an investment in the silvertrading program was that the price of silver would ""go to zero.""21. Rust tells investors that he does not charge a management fee, but compensateshimself by keeping partial shares of silver left over from the trades.L! 22. Rust reassures investors that they can withdraw their funds at any time onapproximately two weeks' notice.23. Prospective investors in the silver trading program do not receive any kind ofoffering materials.24. Rust provides account statements to investors. The statements consist only of aspreadsheet showing the purported transactions over a given month. They report the profitspurportedly generated from Rust's trades during the month, the total ounces of silver owned by agiven investor at month's end, and the total value of the investor's holdings based on the price ofsilver at the time.25. The spreadsheet included in the account statement is prepared by Rust in a basicExcel format. Some of the statements were printed on the letterhead of RRC.26. Rust has been soliciting investors for the silver trading program since at leastJanuary 2017, and the solicitation is ongoing.27. Currently, there are approximately 300 investors in many states across thecountry.28. From January 2017 through August 2018, Rust raised approximately $85.7million from investors in the silver trading program.Uses of investor funds.29. From January 1, 2017 through August 2018, Rust processed funds invested in thesilver trading program through two accounts at Zions Bank. He used the first account ending in7496 (the ""investor account""), for almost all investor deposits and payments back to investors.He used another account, ending in 3564 (the ""Rust coin account""), primarily for activity related5 to his coin business, but also to some extent for investor transactions. Funds are heavilycommingled among these accounts because Rust transferred funds to and from them frequently.MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONSRust and RRC did not store investor silver at Brink's.30. In the fall of 2018, Rust told investors he was storing $80 million of investorsilver at Brink's. Brink's, however, has not held any silver for Rust or any of his entities sincelate 2016.Rust and RRC do not have an account at HSBC, and do not use its algorithm to tradesilver.31. Rust represents to investors that he pools investor funds in an account held byRRC at HSBC and that he trades silver using an algorithm developed by HSBC. He representedto investors that, thanks to this algorithm, he has never had a losing month trading silver. HSBC,however, has stated that it has never maintained an account in the name of Rust or RRC.Investor funds were not used to buy silver in the trading program.32. Rust represents to investors that he uses all investor funds to buy silver to beplaced in the silver trading program. In fact, Rust is diverting most of the investor funds hereceives to his other entities, to personal uses, and to make payments to other investors. FromJanuary 1, 2017 through August 2018 Rust took in approximately $85.7 million from investors.Of this, approximatelya. $70,243,523 was paid out in checks and wires in payments to earlier investors inthe silver trading program;b. $2,667,700 was withdrawn in cash;c. $1,162,000 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Racing, which Rust uses forhis horse racing business;d. $9,165,969 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Entertainment and itssubsidiaries and used for payroll, vendors, equipment and other expenses relatedto Rust's music and production studio; ande. $2,039,994 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Investment.C1 33. These uses account for approximately 99% of the investor deposits into thisaccount.34. Investors were not told that their funds would be used for purposes other than toinvest in the silver trading program.Average returns from the silver trading program, if any, were far less than 20% to 25%.35. Rust represents to investors that his average trading returns for the program are20% to 25% a year or, as he told one investor, 40% a year. He also told an investor that hisworst trading month had still achieved a return of 3%; and that his best trading month hadachieved a return of 21 %.36. Very little silver trading, if any, is taking place in either the investor account orRust coin account at Zions Bank. Evidence suggests the only likely silver-trading expendituresout of the investor account total less than $100,000, involving transactions with precious metaland coin brokers. The Rust coin account expenditures are typical of the retail coin business atRRC, not of a silver trading program.The investor account statements provided by Rust are false.37. The account statements that Rust creates and provides to investors contain falsestatements. They show that Rust engages in various silver trades on behalf of each investorevery month, resulting in a monthly increase in the number of ounces owned by each investor.They also show that the investor owns many ounces of physical silver. In fact, Rust does nottrade silver through HSBC as he represents, nor does he store investor silver at Brink's.Materiality of Misrepresentations38. Rust's misrepresentations to investors and potential investors are material becauseinvestors would certainly find it important to know that Rust does not maintain a trading account7 at HSBC for investors; does not store quantities of investor silver at Brink's; is conducting littleif any silver trading; and is using investor funds for a variety of undisclosed purposes, includingfunding his related entities and paying returns to earlier investors.Scienter of Rust39. Rust knew his representations were false and misleading at the time he made thembecause he has at all times been in possession of the true facts, namely, that he is not storinginvestor silver bullion at Brink's; that he does not have a trading account at HSBC; that he is notusing an HSBC algorithm to trade; that he is carrying out little or no silver trading at all; that heis preparing and transmitting false account statements to investors; and that he is using investorfunds not for silver trading but to make payments to his related entities and to prior investors.The Investments in the Silver Trading Program Are Securities Being Sold in UnregisteredTransactions.40. The purchase of an interest in the silver trading program involves an investmentof money.41. Investor funds are aggregated together in the investor account and, to a lesserextent, in the Rust coin account.42. Payment of the purported investor returns is entirely dependent on Rust'sexecution of the trades in silver bullion. Investors have no role in the silver trading.43. Rust sold millions of dollars of investments in the silver trading program in anunregistered continuous offering to dozens of investors across the United States.44. Rust provided no offering materials to prospective investors.45. Rust never took any steps to determine whether a prospective investor wasaccredited. He never asked investors questions concerning their income or net worth. 46. The investments in the silver trading program were offered and sold to personswho were not accredited within the meaning of the federal securities laws.CLAIMS FOR RELIEFFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEFEMPLOYMENT OF A DEVICE, SCHEME OR ARTIFICE TO DEFRAUDViolation of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1)]47.

WhippleAmy J. OliverAlison J. OkinakaLaurie E. AbbottAttorneys for PlaintiffSecurities and Exchange Commission12","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Utah-based company and its principal in an ongoing investment scheme that has defrauded hundreds of investors in several states.The SEC alleges that Gaylen D. Rust and his company Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (RRC) are engaged in an ongoing investment scheme involving a purported silver trading program. Through this scheme, Rust and RRC have allegedly raised over $85 million since January 2017. According to the SEC, Rust told investors that he has access to a trading algorithm that enables him to capitalize on fluctuations in the price of silver bullion and thereby make profitable trades, regardless of the actual price of silver. He also told investors that he stores millions of tons of physical silver on behalf of investors at Brink's Global Services U.S.A. Inc. Rust claimed that his silver trading program results in average annual returns of 20% to 25%, with some years experiencing significantly higher returns. Rust also told investors that his silver trading program has almost no risk. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Rust has been using new investor funds to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for his personal expenses and the business expenses of other entities he controls.The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, charges Rust and RRC with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.Under the direction of Regional Director Daniel Wadley, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Alison Okinaka, Scott Frost, and Laurie Abbott, and litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver.

14,"1  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE        COMMISSION,                                       Plaintiff,             v.   MICHAEL A. BRESSMAN,                                      Defendant.     Civil Action No. ________  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED   COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ or ﬁSECﬂ) alleges the following against defendant Michael A. Bressman (ﬁBressmanﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ): SUMMARY 1. This case involves a fraudulent ﬁcherry-pickingﬂ scheme carried out by Bressman in his role as a securities broker.  From at least January 2012 through February 2018, Bressman secretly misused his access to his customers™ brokerage accounts to enrich himself and two of his family members at the expense of his customersŠmost of whom were ﬁMain Streetﬂ investors with relatively modest investment portfolios.  As a result of his deceptive scheme, Bressman received at least $700,000 in ill-gotten gains.   2. Cherry-picking occurs when a broker, who buys and sells securities on behalf of his brokerage customers, defrauds those customers by purchasing stock and then waiting to see whether the price of the stock goes up, or down, before allocating the trade.  If the stock goes up, the broker keeps the trade for himself or a set of ﬁfavoredﬂ accounts.  If the stock goes down, the broker puts the trades into other, disfavored customer accounts.  In other words, the broker ﬁcherry-picksﬂ the profitable trades for himself or certain favored accounts, while giving unprofitable trades to his other customers.   3. To carry out the cherry-picking scheme here, Bressman frequently purchased large quantities of stock using a block trading or ﬁallocationﬂ account (the ﬁAllocation Accountﬂ).  Bressman made these stock purchases without specifying whether the trade was for one or more of his brokerage customers or his own personal securities trading account.  Then, Bressman typically  2  waited to see whether the price of the stock he had purchased in the Allocation Account went up or down during the day of the trade (the ﬁTrade Dayﬂ).  If a stock™s price went up, Bressman routinely transferred that stock from the Allocation Account to his own account (the ﬁPersonal Accountﬂ) or an account jointly held by his sister-in-law and her husband (the ﬁFamily Accountﬂ).  Most frequently, Bressman transferred the profitable trades to his Personal Account.  By contrast, if the price of the stock went down during the Trade Day, Bressman routinely transferred the stock to one or more accounts held by his other customers (the ﬁCustomer Accountsﬂ).   4. In those instances that Bressman transferred a winning trade to his Personal Account, he often closed out the position on the same day.  These ﬁday tradesﬂ allowed Bressman to immediately lock in his gains.  In those instances that Bressman transferred a losing trade to one or more Customer Accounts, he typically held the position in the Customer Account(s) for an extended period of time as a ﬁbuy and holdﬂ investment.  Through this scheme, Bressman misappropriated profits that should have gone to his Customer Accounts, and avoided losses that should have been borne by his Personal Account and the Family Account.  5. Bressman™s conduct violated various antifraud statues and Commission rules, including Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) and Ruled 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder. 6. Based on these violations, the Commission seeks: (1) entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting Bressman from further violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws; (2) disgorgement of ill-gotten gains for the period covered by the applicable statute of limitations, plus pre-judgement interest; (3) the imposition of a civil monetary penalty; and (4) such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the enforcement authority conferred upon it by Sections 20(b) and 20(d)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) & 77t(d)(1)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78u(d)]. 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1) & 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].  3  9. Defendant, directly or indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions acts, practices, and course of business alleged herein. 10. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act  [15 U.S.C. § 77(v)(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa], because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within the District of Massachusetts.  Among other things, Bressman made certain of the fraudulent trade allocations while in Massachusetts. DEFENDANT 11. Michael A. Bressman (ﬁBressmanﬂ), age 61, resides in Montville, New Jersey, and until recently, worked as a securities broker.  From approximately 2010 to May 2018, Bressman was associated with a registered broker-dealer (the ﬁBrokerage Firmﬂ) located in Chatham, New Jersey.  The Brokerage Firm terminated Bressman™s employment on May 4, 2018.  Bressman held Series 63, 65 and 66 licenses.   ALLEGATIONS A. BACKGROUND 12. From at least January 2012 through February 2018 (the ﬁrelevant periodﬂ), Bressman acted as a securities broker for more than 60 individuals and families, many of whom had entrusted Bressman with their retirement savings.  Each of these customers held one or more accounts with the Brokerage Firm, to which Bressman had access. 1  For the majority of these customers, Bressman was given discretionary trading authority, meaning that he could buy and sell stock for those accounts without receiving approval from the customer for each transaction.  For his other accounts, Bressman was supposed to obtain approval from the customer before making a trade on the customer™s behalf.  Even in the case of these accounts, Bressman was responsible for entering the trades and, absent specific customer instructions to the contrary, could determine the time and price at which securities were bought and sold for the customer.                                                  1  The Brokerage Firm is an introducing broker.  All of the relevant accounts described herein were maintained by, and cleared through, a separate clearing brokerage firm (the ﬁClearing Firmﬂ). Bressman did not have any direct relationship with the Clearing Firm.   4  13. Each of Bressman™s customers paid the Brokerage Firm a commission when Bressman bought or sold securities on his or her behalf.  The Brokerage Firm, in turn, paid Bressman a portion of these trading commissions.  14. Two of Bressman™s brokerage customers were his sister-in-law and her husband, the holders of the Family Account.  Bressman exercised discretionary authority over the Family Account.  In addition to buying and selling securities for the Customer Accounts or the Family Account, Bressman could buy and sell securities for himself through the Personal Account.   15. Bressman could place trades for the Customer Accounts, the Family Account or his Personal Account in two ways.  First, Bressman could buy or sell securities directly in a Customer Account, the Family Account, or the Personal Account.  Alternatively, Bressman could make trades using the Allocation Account and then subsequently distribute those trades to a selected Customer, Personal, and/or Family Account(s).  An allocation or ﬁomnibusﬂ account is a type of account used for large purchases of stock or trades in which a broker is purchasing the same stock for several different customers at the same time.  Typically, a broker purchases stock in an allocation account and then transfers the stock to one or more participating customer accounts.  These transfers are usually referred to as ﬁallocations.ﬂ  When used appropriately, an allocation account may reduce trading costs, by allowing the broker to execute one large transaction instead of several smaller transactions, and ensures that all customers purchasing the same stock at the same time receive the same price. 16. The Allocation Account used by Bressman worked as follows: First, Bressman would place an order to purchase securities in the Allocation Account using an online trading platform provided to the Brokerage Firm and its brokers by the Clearing Firm.  These orders did not identify which accounts were participating in the trade (i.e., which accounts were supposed to receive the stock from the Allocation Account after the trade was executed).  After the trade was executed, Bressman would use the online trading platform to either (a) sell the stock using the Allocation Account or (b) allocate the stock from the Allocation Account to one or more other accounts.  Stock purchased in the Allocation Account could be allocated to Bressman™s Personal Account, the Family Account, one or more Customer Accounts, or some combination thereof.  If Bressman sold the stock directly from the Allocation Account, he would later have to allocate both the purchase transaction and the sale transaction to one or more of these accounts, again using the online trading platform.   5  17. During the relevant period, Bressman was the only person who made decisions about the trades made in, and the allocations made from, the Allocation Account.  B. DEFENDANT™S FRAUDULENT SCHEME 18. During the relevant period, Bressman misused the Allocation Account to disproportionately allocate profitable trades to his Personal Account and the Family Account and, conversely, to disproportionately allocate unprofitable trades to the Customer Accounts.  19. During the relevant period, Bressman placed approximately 5,000 trades using the Allocation Account.  When Bressman purchased stock using the Allocation Account, he typically delayed making any allocation to another account, or otherwise indicating which account was supposed to receive the resulting stock.  This delay in making an allocation enabled Bressman to watch how the stock performed in the hours after the trade before deciding how to allocate it.  Bressman then could, and did, make allocations based on the stock™s performance after the trade. 20. When the price of the stock went up during the Trade Day (a ﬁwinning tradeﬂ),2 Bressman, on disproportionately frequent basis, allocated the winning trade to his Personal Account, the Family Account, or both.  Most often, Bressman allocated winning trades solely to his Personal Account.  Conversely, when the price of the stock went down during the Trade Day (a ﬁlosing tradeﬂ), Bressman, on a disproportionately frequent basis, allocated the stock to one or more Customer Accounts.   21. In a significant number of cases, when Bressman allocated a winning trade to his Personal Account, Bressman then locked in his gains on the winning trade by selling the security as a day trade.  In fact, when Bressman saw the price of a particular stock go up, he often immediately sold the stock from the Allocation Account, before allocating it to his Personal Account (or any other account).  Once his profit was guaranteed, Bressman then allocated both the purchase and the sale of the stock to his Personal Account, realizing an immediate profit for himself and taking on zero risk of price decline from such trades.   22. By contrast, when Bressman allocated losing trades to his customers, he did not immediately sell the stock resulting from those losing trades from the Customer Accounts in most cases.  Instead, Bressman typically kept these stocks in the Customer Accounts for an extended                                                  2  Specifically, a ﬁwinning tradeﬂ is defined as a purchase that is profitable based on (a) the actual sale price of the stock, if the stock was sold on the Trade Day or (b) the closing price of the stock on the Trade Day, if the stock was not sold on the Trade Day.  A ﬁlosing tradeﬂ is defined as a purchase that was not profitable based on (a) the actual sale price of the stock, if the stock was sold on the Trade Day or (b) the closing price of the stock on the Trade Day, if the stock was not sold on the Trade Day.  Similar rules apply to ﬁshort salesﬂ when considering ﬁwinningﬂ and ﬁlosingﬂ tradesﬂ and ﬁlosing trades.ﬂ  6  period of time as so-called ﬁbuy-and-holdﬂ investments.  While the value of these holdings either rose or fell after the Trade Day, Bressman™s fraudulent allocations unfairly deprived his customers of first-day profits and saddled them with first-day losses.  23. When Bressman allocated losing trades to the Customer Accounts, he never told the affected customers that the reason they had received these particular trades was to help him and his family members avoid trading losses.  Indeed, Bressman never revealed to his customers in any way that he was cherry-picking profitable trades to enrich himself and his family members at their direct expense.  Instead, Bressman deceived his customers so that he could continue to receive both illicit profits from the scheme and from the commissions his customers paid him for making trades.  24. In the case of each of his discretionary-account customers, Bressman had affirmative fiduciary duties of loyalty, fairness and good faith.  These duties required Bressman to, among other things, act in the best interest of his customers when making trading or allocation decisions.  Bressman violated these fiduciary duties by making allocations that were based on his own greed and self-interest, rather than his customers™ interests.    C.  EXAMPLES OF DEFENDANT™S FRAUDULENT TRADE ALLOCATIONS 25. Bressman™s fraudulent conduct in allocating winning trades to himself and his family members as day trades, and allocating losing trades to his customers, can be illustrated by the following examples. 26. On November 24, 2014, Bressman allocated a winning day trade in the pharmaceutical company Baxalta, Inc. (ﬁBXLTﬂ) worth more than $10,000 to himself and his family members, as shown in the chart below:  7   27. As shown above, Bressman purchased the BXLT stock using the Allocation Account in the morning, but delayed making any allocation of the stock for over six hours.  This delay allowed Bressman to see how the stock would perform.  Once the price of the BXLT stock (shown in blue) increased dramatically in the late afternoon, Bressman sold the stock from the Allocation Account as a day trade.  Once the profit from this day trade was locked-in, Bressman then allocated the entire trade to his Personal Account and the Family Account.  Bressman™s other customers did not receive any allocation from the highly profitable BXLT trade. 28. As another example, on March 21, 2017, Bressman allocated a losing trade of 4,000 shares of stock in MetLife, Inc. (ﬁMETﬂ) to certain Customer Accounts, giving these customers the resulting one-day loss of $4,280.  This fraudulent allocation is shown in the chart below:  8   29. As shown above, Bressman purchased the MET stock using the Allocation Account in the morning, but again delayed making an allocation for more than five hours.  In this case, the price of MET stock went down during the day.  At the very end of the trading day, when the price of the stock was still down, Bressman allocated the losing trade to a group of Customer Accounts.  Bressman did not give any part of this losing trade to his Personal Account or the Family Account.   C. DEFENDANT CONTINUED HIS SCHEME AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PRE-CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT  30. In February 2016, the Brokerage Firm told Bressman that he would need to begin complying with the Brokerage Firm™s pre-clearance process for all of his personal trades, including trades that Bressman made in the Allocation Account and then allocated to his Personal Account.  Under the Brokerage Firm™s policies, ﬁpre-clearingﬂ a trade meant that a broker had to submit a form to a designated Brokerage Firm employee indicating, among other things, (a) the stock that the broker planned to trade; (b) whether the broker planned to buy or sell the stock; (c) the number of shares to be purchased or sold and (c) whether any ﬁadvisory clientsﬂ (i.e. customers) of the Brokerage Firm had a current order for the stock.  9  31.  The implementation of this pre-clearance process did not stop Bressman™s fraudulent trading scheme.  In many instances, Bressman waited to submit the pre-clearance form until well after he placed the initial trade in the Allocation Account.  This delay enabled him to continue to see whether the stock went up or down before making his allocation decisions.   32. In other instances, Bressman submitted a preclearance form indicating that he intended to buy a security, but then still allocated the security to his customers.  Specifically, in 56 instances, Bressman submitted a pre-clearance form to the Brokerage Firm stating that a particular trade was for his own account, and that no customers had a current order for the stock, but then later allocated the entire trade to a group of Customer Accounts.  These trades performed significantly worse than the pre-cleared trades Bressman allocated to his Personal Account. Specifically, the pre-cleared trades allocated entirely to Customer Accounts had a win rate of less than 30% and an average first-day loss of 0.49%, while the pre-cleared trades allocated entirely to Bressman™s personal account had a win rate of 84% and an average first-day gain of 0.45%.  This disparity indicates that Bressman continued to make allocation decisions based on the post-trade performance of the stock, even after the imposition of the pre-clearance requirement.  33. For example, at 10:28 a.m. on May 11, 2016, Bressman submitted a pre-clearance form to the Brokerage Firm indicating that he planned to purchase stock in the biotechnology company Celgene Corporation (ﬁCELGﬂ) for his Personal Account.  On the pre-clearance form, Bressman stated that no customers had a current order for CELG stock and that he was not considering purchasing CELG stock for any of his customers. 34. As shown on the chart below, Bressman purchased CELG shares using the Allocation Account at 11:30 a.m.  Despite having told the Brokerage Firm that this trade was intended for his Personal Account, Bressman did not allocate the trade to his Personal Account.  Instead, Bressman delayed making any allocation and waited more than four hours to see how CELG stock would perform.  During this period, the price of CELG steadily declined.  Finally, after the market had closed for the day and Bressman could see that the CELG stock had closed down, he allocated the entire trade to a group of Customer Accounts.  The Customer Accounts lost $1,914 as a result.  Bressman™s Personal Account did not receive any of the CELG stock, and therefore did not share in this loss, even though he had told the Brokerage Firm on the pre-clearance form that the trade was for his Personal Account and that he was not even considering the trade for his customers.  10   D. THE RESULTS OF DEFENDANT™S FRAUDULENT SCHEME 35. During the relevant period, Bressman regularly engaged in the type of fraudulent and self-serving trade allocations described above.  During the relevant period, Bressman allocated approximately 1,610 trades to the Personal Account and the Family Account, approximately 1,179 of which were profitable on the first day, for a success rate of approximately 73%.  The vast majority of these winning trades Œ 1,070 trades Œ were allocated to the Personal Account.  By contrast, of the 3,371 trades Bressman allocated to the Customer Accounts during the same period, approximately 600 were profitable on the first day, a success rate of just 18%.  36. This scheme allowed Bressman to personally obtain at least $700,000 more than he would have received had he fairly allocated the trades.  Additionally, Bressman™s fraudulent allocations to the Family Account caused his family members to receive approximately $50,000 more than they otherwise would have received. 37. In the case of the Personal Account, at least $650,000 of Bressman™s ill-gotten gains were attributable to day trades in which Bressman closed out the trade on the same day it was made.  In total, Bressman made 807 day trades for himself, 92.1% of which were profitable.  Virtually all  11  (99%) of these profitable day trades involved instances in which Bressman sold the stock from the Allocation Account before making an allocation, thereby ensuring that the trade was profitable before giving it to himself.   38. By contrast, Bressman™s customers bore the cost of his fraud, collectively receiving approximately $750,000 less than they would have, absent Bressman™s scheme.

34,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIAATLANTA DIVISIONSecurities and ExchangeCommission,Plaintiff,Civil Action No.v.Salvadore D. Palermo,Defendants.COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEFPlaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"" or ""Commission"")files this Complaint and alleges as follows:OVERVIEW1. Defendant Salvadore D. Palermo (""Defendant"" or ""Palermo""), aformer fixed income trader for J.P. Turner, L.L.C. (""J.P. Turner""), anow-defunctbroker-dealer formerly registered with the Commission, knowingly entered a seriesof fictitious sales of certain financial instruments which resulted in J.P. Turner'screating and maintaining inaccurate financial books, records and reports.1Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 1 of 12 2. Specifically, between at least August 2014 and March 2015, Palermoentered certain fictitious sales orders in J.P. Turner's books, records and electronictrading systems despite knowing that the named counterparty/purchaser had neveragreed to buy the instruments and that each sales order would ultimately becancelled with the instruments being returned to J.P. Turner's inventory.3. Palermo created these sham sales to temporarily remove theinstruments from J.P. Turner's inventory in order to appear to comply with J.P.Turner's internal inventory policy, which strictly limited the dollar amount of fixedincome inventory that could be held at month end and at other times intra-month.4. As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner made andmaintained inaccurate trading and financial books and records, and filed with theCommission inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single(""FOCUS"") Reports, which contain certain financial and operational informationfor the firm, for each month between at least August 2014 and February 2015, allof which violated of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(""Exchange Act"") and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder.5. Palermo aided and abetted these violations by J.P. Turner.JURISDICTION AND VENUE2Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 2 of 12 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 21 ofthe Exchange Act, to enjoin Defendant from engaging in the transactions, acts,practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and. transactions, acts,practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object, for civil penaltiesand for other equitable relief.7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d),21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act.8. Defendant, directly, and indirectly, made use of the mails, the meansand instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce andthe means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with thetransactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.9. Venue lies in this Court because Defendant Palermo was and is aresident of this District, including during the time period between August 2014 andApri12015, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to theviolations of the Exchange Act occurred within this District.DEFENDANT AND RELEVANT ENTITY10. Defendant Palermo has resided within this District for several years,including between August 2014 and April 2015. Palermo worked for J.P. Turnerfrom February 2003 until his termination in July 2015, spending the last five yearsCase 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 3 of 12 of that time as a fixed income trader. Prior to his employment at J.P. Turner,Palermo worked for several broker-dealers, and he has held Series 7, 24(principal), and 63 licenses since the 1980s.11. J.P. Turner was a Georgia limited liability company with its principalplace of business in Atlanta, Georgia. J.P. Turner was privately owned from 1997until June 2014 when it was acquired by RCS Capital Corporation, whichthereafter filed for bankruptcy in 201.5. J.P. Turner was registered with theCommission as abroker-dealer until Apri14, 2016, when its withdrawal FonnBDW (filed earlier in February 2016) became effective. The firm is no longeroperational.BACKGROUND12. In 2003, Palermo joined J.P. Turner as a registered representative,after being employed for seventeen years in the Atlanta area with several differentbroker-dealers.13. In approximately 2010, after seven years of managing a retail book ofbusiness, Palermo transitioned to J.P. Turner's fixed income desk as a trader. Inthis position Palermo serviced the fixed income product requirements of J.P.Turner's registered representatives and their customers by locating and trading withthird-party buyers and sellers of fixed income products.Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 4 of 12 14. As a fixed income trader, Palermo frequently worked with a certainJ.P. Turner registered representative (""Broker"") who regularly invested clients in afixed income financial instrument called amarket-linked certificate of deposit(""MLCD"") .15. MLCDs are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"") insuredcertificates of deposit that tie their rate of return to the performance of one or moresecurities or market indexes, such as bond indexes, the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. MLCDs can be attractive toinvestors due to the possibility of higher returns than traditional CDs, whileproviding some ""principal protection"" for the original deposit amount via FDICinsurance. However, MLCDs are riskier than traditional CDs due to their longermaturity (generally from five to twenty years), limited secondary market andexposure to market downturns (which may result in little to no investment return atmaturity).16. Palermo would routinely buy and sell MLCDs and other fixed incomeproducts on the behalf of Broker and other registered representatives at J.P. Turner.Palermo would utilize J.P. Turner's fixed income desk trading accounts totemporarily maintain positions in these products. However, because the fixedincome desk did not conduct proprietary trading (i.e. trading for its own profit),5Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 5 of 12 and to avoid market risk due to long term positions in fixed income financialproducts, J.P. Turner internal policy placed strict limits on how much inventoryPalermo and the fixed income desk could hold in its accounts without authorizationby management. During 2014 and 2015, J.P. Turner required that the fixedincome inventory accounts be at zero at each month-end and not exceedapproximately $2 to $4 million at any point during each month (again, subject toauthorization by management) .PALERMO PURCHASES AND HOLDSMLCDs IN J.P. TURNER'S INVENTORY17. Beginning in approximately 2013, and continuing into 2014 and 2015,several of Broker's customers sought to sell certain MLCDs held in their accountsprior to maturity. However, the prevailing market price of the instruments wasoften significantly below par amount, which would result in a loss to thesecustomers upon sale.18. To avoid such losses, Broker reached out to Palermo for assistance.Frequently, Palermo would agree to repurchase the MLCD at par value and holdthem in J.P. Turner's fixed income inventory account. Then, Palermo would seekto sell the MLCDs from the fixed income inventory to a third party at a price at ornear par to avoid losses in the fixed income account.DCase 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 6 of 12 19. Although Palermo was occasionally able to sell the MLCDs at or nearpar value, locating a purchaser and completing a trade often took time and requiredPalermo to maintain multi-million dollar MLCD positions in the J.P. Turner fixedinventory account for weeks and in some cases months.PALERMO ENTERED FICTITIOUS SALES TO TEMPORARILYREMOVE MLCDs FROM J.P. TURNER'S INVENTORY ACCOUNT20. Beginning in approximately August 2014, this time delay requiredPalermo to hold MLCD positions for longer periods of time (sometimes as long asseveral months), substantially increasing J.P. Turner's fixed income inventoryposition.21. In order to comply with J.P. Turner's limits on fixed incomeinventory, while avoiding a loss due to market sales of the MLCD positions, foreach month-end from August 2014 through March 2015, and on several occasionsintra-month during that same period, Palermo entered fictitious sales of MLCDsfrom the firm's inventory.22. For each of these fictitious sales, Palermo named a large third-partybroker-dealer as counterparty (without their knowledge) (""Purchaser""), and set thepurchase price at par value (to avoid recording a loss). By entering these trades,Palermo was able to fraudulently remove the oversized MLCD inventory tocomply with J.P. Turner's inventory restrictions, while avoiding selling the7Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 7 of 12 inventory at a loss. Although the removal of the inventory was temporary, as thefictitious sales would ultimately be rejected by Purchaser and taken back into J.P.Turner's fixed income inventory, this process would take a few days' time. Thisdelay allowed Palermo to comply with the strict month-end inventory limitations(which did not allow any inventory to be held) and recover the inventory intra-month when J.P. Turner's policy allowed for several million dollars' worth ofinventory holdings.23. By way of example, on Friday, February 27, 2015 at 4:10 p.m. the lastbusiness day of the month, Palermo entered the following four sales of MLCDswith Purchaser as the purported counterparty:Ł $1,334,000 of Citibank MLCDs at 100 (par);Ł $380,000 of United Community Bank MLCDs at 100 (par);Ł $1,105,000 of Citibank MLCDs at 100 (par); andŁ $620,000 of United Community Bank MLCDs at 100 (par).24. By entering these four sales, Palermo removed $3.44 million ofinventory from the J.P. Turner's fixed income inventory at month end.25. In early March 2015, following J.P. Turner's clearing firm advisingthat the trades had not been ""recognized"" or accepted by Purchaser, Palermo~'3Case 1:18-cv-03747-TCB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/18   Page 8 of 12 cancelled the trades, with the $3.44 million of MLCD inventory returned to the J.P.Turner fixed income inventory.26. In some cases Palermo issued fictitious sales for the same instrumentnumerous times, while effectively holding the instrument for several months.27. In total, Palermo entered 48 fictitious sales totaling over $24 millionbetween August 2014 and March 2015.28. Palermo's fictitious sales resulted in errors to J.P. Turner's books,records and reports from at least August 2014 to Apri12015, including the creationand maintaining of inaccurate trade blotters, misstated asset and revenue accountbalances, and the filing of inaccurate FOCUS Reports with the Commission.29. In July 2015, J.P. Turner terminated Palermo's employment noting onhis Form U5: ""Engaged in structured product transactions for the apparent purposeof concealing inventory positions.""COUNTIAIDING AND ABETTING VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 17(a)(1) OF THEEXCHANGE ACT [15 U.S.C. § 78Q(a)(1)] AND RULES 17a-3 AND 17a-5 [17CFR §§ 240.17a-3 AND 17a-5] THEREUNDER.30.

Palermo, a trader formerly employed by J.P. Turner & Company, L.L.C., with entering fictitious sales of market-linked certificates of deposit (MLCDs) in order to avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations for the fixed income products.According to the complaint, Palermo paid above-market prices to acquire MLCDs from J.P. Turner brokerage customers, and then held the MLCDs in J.P. Turner's inventory. To avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations, Palermo entered dozens of fictitious trades over a seven-month period, beginning in August 2014. Palermo entered the sham sales in order to give the impression that the MLCDs had been sold from J.P. Turner's inventory , knowing the named counterparty never agreed to buy the MLCDs and that each trade would ultimately be cancelled. As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner kept inaccurate trade blotters, showed incorrect asset and revenue account balances, and filed inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports for each month between August 2014 and February 2015.The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Palermo aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties and other relief.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Mark Troszak, under the supervision of Peter Diskin in the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by Paul Kim and supervised by Graham Loomis."

This SEC enforcement action is being brought to stop an ongoingoffering fraud, where the defendants have promoted a fake technology and illusoryprospects for its commercial success to enrich themselves with investors' funds. Thefederal securities laws vest in this Court the power to enjoin, on an emergency basis,further violations of the law. The Court also has the equitable authority to freeze theassets of securities law violators for the good of defrauded investors, order them toprovide a sworn accounting of their financial affairs, and prohibit them fromdestroying relevant documents. Because defendants continue to raise money frominvestors, and have a history of quickly dissipating investor funds for their personaluse, the SEC now brings this action to secure that emergency relief from this Court.2. Defendant Moddha Interactive, Inc. (""Moddha"") calls itself a""worldwide Positive Media and Technology Corporation."" Defendants Sandor andPorrazzo, who are married, are Moddha's only officers or directors. Moddha claimsto own an ""exclusive proprietary portfolio of patents based on the QuantumTransducer ('QT'),"" a technology that will ""revolutionize"" conventional mobilephones, allow consumers to operate tablet devices ""with the wave of your hand as ifyou were Tony Stark in Iron Man,"" and produce ""a more elegant, thinner, healthierand more energy-efficient device than iPhone and Android."" In meetings withpotential investors, Moddha demonstrated a tablet device, similar to an iPad butcapable of displaying 3D images, that supposedly incorporated Moddha's patented""QT"" technology. Sandor and Porrazzo also burnished Moddha's commercial bonafides with claims that it had just become a ""Registered Supplier"" of a globaltelecommunications firm (""Global Telecommunications Firm""). On the basis of thispresumed technology, Moddha has raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors since2012 through a private placement offering of its unregistered securities. These funds,however, were procured by fraud: Moddha's purported ""Quantum Transducer""COMPLAINT 1Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 2 of 27     PageID #: 2 technology is a sham.3. In truth, Moddha's intellectual property portfolio consists of only ahandful of patents, all of which are expired and thus commercially worthless. Thedevices touted by Moddha's offering materials and demonstrated by Sandor andPorrazzo to potential investors were either fake, or were designed and developed byother companies. Moddha never had, and continues to have no business relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm. And instead of using investor funds instrict accordance with the limitations contained in Moddha's private placementmemorandum, the majority of the money Moddha raised in the last year has beenmisappropriated through transfers to Sandor and Porrazzo's personal accounts andspent on personal things that have nothing to do with the business, including a 7-nightstay at a luxury hotel the week of Thanksgiving in 2017.4. Investor money was also funneled to defendant Spar Street, to pay himsales commissions for acting as a sales agent for the offering and drumming up newinvestors. Street, however, has never registered with the SEC to be a broker.5. When confronted by their investors, Sandor and Porrazzo compoundedtheir lies, repeatedly claiming that a large influx of funds was imminent andModdha's investors would soon be made whole through a dividend share buyback.They claimed this new money would come from the Global TelecommunicationsFirm, or from a wealthy investor whose forthcoming $150 million investment inModdha was delayed, the defendants claimed, due to a variety of excuses, includingsickness, gun violence at an embassy, and the eruption of a volcano in Iceland. Thiswas false - the Global Telecommunications firm does not do business with Moddhaat all, and there is no imminent new funding from some alleged wealthy investor. Inspite of defendants' increasingly outlandish excuses, Moddha's expired patentportfolio and sham business had no prospect of generating real returns for itsinvestors.6. By engaging in this conduct; (i) defendants Moddha, Sandor, andCOMPLAINT 2Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 3 of 27     PageID #: 3 Porrazzo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15U.S.C. § 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and RulelOb-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5; and (ii) defendant Street violated thebroker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.§ 780(a).JURISDICTION AND VENUE7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b),20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d)(l) & 77v(a), and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e) and 27(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(l),78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e) & 78aa(a).8. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means orinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a nationalsecurities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses ofbusiness alleged in this complaint.9. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the SecuritiesAct, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of conduct constitutingviolations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district. In addition,venue is proper in this district because defendants Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street residein this district, and defendant Moddha has its principal place of business in thisdistrict.DEFENDANTS10. Defendant Moddha Interactive, Inc. was formed in 2002, incorporated inHawaii, and its principal place of business is Kahului, Hawaii. Moddha is notregistered with the SEC in any capacity. The company's securities are not registeredwith the SEC, nor are they listed on any exchange. Moddha purports to be atechnology and media company that is the beneficiary of an enormously valuableCOMPLAINT 3Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 4 of 27     PageID #: 4 patent portfolio.11. Defendant Marianne Veronika Sandor, age 48, is a resident of Hana,Hawaii. She is Moddha's chairman and chief executive officer. Along withdefendant Porrazzo, Sandor is a signatory to Moddha's corporate bank accounts.12. Defendant Edward Michael Porrazzo is 61 years old and a resident ofHana, Hawaii. He is Moddha's chief technology officer, secretary, and treasurer, andis Sandor's spouse.13. Defendant Spar Street, age 55, is a resident of Haiku, Hawaii. Streetacted as a sales agent for Moddha by identifying potential investors, promotingModdha to them, and arranging meetings between them and defendants Sandor andPorrazzo to discuss potential investment. Street is also a member of Moddha's so-called ""Board of Advisors."" Street is not registered as a broker-dealer or associatedwith a registered broker-dealer.THE ALLEGATIONSA. Moddha's Securities Offering14. In a November 2014 filing and a February 2018 amended filing with theSEC, Moddha stated that it had been engaged in an offering of unregistered securitiessince July 7, 2012. Moddha's SEC filings further stated that as of December 31,2017, the company had raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors located in multiplestates.15. Moddha solicits investors for its securities offering through thecompany's website, online professional profiles for Sandor and Porrazzo, the use ofsales agents, in-person meetings with potential investors, and written offeringmaterials provided to investors and potential investors, including a private placementmemorandum (""PPM""), and has been doing so since at least 2015.16. Porrazzo and Sandor are Moddha's chief technology officer andchairman/chief executive officer, respectively; they are Moddha's only officers ordirectors; they possess sole control over decisions concerning Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 4Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 5 of 27     PageID #: 5 management, operation, and policies; they affixed their names to many of the writtenmaterials provided by the company to potential investors, and thus, on informationand belief, Porrazzo and Sandor each had ultimate authority over the content ofModdha's offering materials, including its PPM, and whether and how tocommunicate that content to investors and potential investors.17. In its offering materials, Moddha dubbed itself as a ""worldwide PositiveMedia and Technology Corporation.""18. Moddha's PPM described its purported business in sprawling terms,claiming that it is; (i) poised to profit from ""consumer product sales, subscriptionservices; including vast licensing dollars with its proprietary hardware, software andoriginal content in diverse global industries""; (ii) ""currently offeringtelecommunications products and services licenses worldwide, with an initial focuson the Middle East and Africa, Western and Eastern Europe, South America, Mexico,Central America and the Caribbean, with future plans to expand into Asia, India,North America and beyond""; and (iii) creating ""its own proprietary content and alsoacquiring existing media, such as documentary films and educational games as wellas feature films, for providing to its Global Digital Subscription Network, connectingschools world-wide.""19. A key representation in the PPM is that Moddha ""owns an exclusive,proprietary portfolio of patents based on the Quantum Transducer (QT).""20. When describing its purported Quantum Transducer, ""QT"" technology,the company's PPM claimed that:a. ""There is at least one transducer in everything electronic andabout 15 transducers in a cellphone. All other transducers perform only one function... QT performs multiple functions and frequencies simultaneously, sending andreceiving without interference on the same paper-thin surface.""b. ""QT replaces conventional transducers ... QTs reduce harmfulradiation. QTs reduce the cost of manufacturing. QTs reduce the cost of cellularCOMPLAINT 5Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 6 of 27     PageID #: 6 networks and extend ranges and capabilities, especially in expanding rural areas.QTs greatly increase battery life, data transfer rates and data capacity. MODDHA'sQT revolutionizes conventional cellphones.""c. ""QTs operate with such levels of efficiency, improvement andcost-effectiveness that QT's transform all electronics and offer entirely new ways ofharnessing wireless electricity that can help bring balance to the planet.""21. Moddha also represented in its offering materials that its proprietary QTtechnology had been incorporated in an array of Moddha products, including whatModdha called its ""Q-Tablet"" and ""Q-Connect Smart Phone"" devices.22. According to Moddha's PPM, its ""patented revolutionary QT technologyprovides a new interface to create and distribute 3-D interactive content"" through aproprietary touchscreen that Moddha called, ""WaveScreen,"" which ""allows you tomanipulate and interact with your device in 3-D with the wave of your hand, as if youwere Tony Stark in Iron Man. But QT and the WaveScreen aren't science fiction;they are science-fact.""23. Having incorporated the QT-enabled ""WaveScreen"" interface into itsproducts, Moddha's PPM claimed that ""MODDHA is positioned to change the faceof consumer electronics, media, telemedicine and education by featuring the QTWaveScreen interactive display interface technology, on its Q-Tablet and Q-ConnectSmart Phone devices.""24. This was all a sham. Moddha's extravagant claims of having secured theintellectual property rights for a ground-breaking technology that would transform theconsumer electronics, media, telemedicine, and educational markets were uniformlyfalse.25. Moddha had no true revenue-generating relationships with anyone, muchless as a ""Registered Supplier"" to the Global Telecommunications Firm.26. At bottom, Moddha's unregistered securities offering was simply ameans to fund Sandor's and Porrazzo's lifestyle, in stark contravention of Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 6Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 7 of 27     PageID #: 7 PPM, which explicitly set forth how investor funds were to be used.27. Moddha's offering is ongoing, and defendants are continuing to solicitinvestors and obtain investor funds.B. The Material Misrepresentations and Omissions1. Moddha's Expired and Worthless Patent Portfolio28. To convince potential investors that it could profit from its technology,Moddha needed them to believe that the company had intellectual property rights toQT.29. On that subject, Moddha's PPM repeatedly stressed that it owned avaluable and expansive portfolio of patents which covered the purported QTtechnology:a. ""MODDHA owns its own exclusive proprietary portfolio ofpatents based on the Quantum Transducer ('QT') that simplifies, harmonizes andexpands the capabilities currently offered by conventional communications,electronics, display interfaces and wireless delivery.""b. ""MODDHA believes its patents comprise the hardware formodem-day touch-screens.""c. ""MODDHA is poised to capture a dominant position in today'scellular telecom market with its patented QT technology that increases reception andtransmission quality ...""d. ""MODDHA'S patented, multi-functional transducer technologyhas the potential to provide not only significant incremental changes, but also long-term, dismptive replacements in nearly every major industry worldwide.""e. ""The proven history of QT has opened the door for manysuccessful high-tech companies like Apple, Philips Electronics,Google/HTC/Motorola and Samsung, to catapult themselves to over $50 billionannually with the use of trade secrets, IP and patented technologies that are nowowned and protected by MODDHA. MODDHA desires to collect infringementCOMPLAINT 7Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 8 of 27     PageID #: 8 damages from companies once they have been legally judged to have infringed or tohave agreed to settle.""30. In the same vein, Moddha's offering summary - which bears bothSandor and Porrazzo's names - claims that ""MODDHA owns its own exclusiveproprietary portfolio of patents based on Quantum Transduction ('QT') that iselegant, simple and expands the capabilities currently offered by conventionalcommunications, electronics, display interfaces, wireless delivery, wearabletechnology and 3D interactivity.""31. Sandor and Porrazzo also affixed their names to a PowerPointpresentation used with investors, which referred to Moddha's ""proprietarytechnologies"" and similarly represented that Moddha had a ""Well Protected,Established, Mature Intellectual Property Estate.""32. Porrazzo and Sandor also represented, during in-person meetings withpotential investors, that Moddha owned patents which covered its technology. Theserepresentations were specifically made in an October 2017 meeting with a marriedcouple who were solicited to invest.33. These representations of an immensely valuable and enforceable patentportfolio were false.34. Moddha owns only five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (""USPTO"") related to transducers and speakers. The five patents wereassigned to Moddha in 2011.35. At the time they were assigned to Moddha, two of Moddha's five patentshad already expired. Those two patents had expired by operation of law in 2004because of the patent-holder's failure to pay the required maintenance fees with theUSPTO.36. The last three Moddha patents had all expired as of May 2014 becauseeach patent's statutory patent term had expired.37. In 2017, a consultant to several of Moddha's investors confrontedCOMPLAINT 8Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 9 of 27     PageID #: 9 Porrazzo and Sandor about Moddha's expired patent portfolio. Porrazzo and Sandoradmitted that Moddha's patent portfolio had expired.38. Moddha, Sandor, and Porrazzo's representations that Moddha heldenforceable intellectual property rights for its claimed technological innovation wereimportant to Moddha investors when they decided to invest their money in Moddha'sunregistered securities. The purported QT technology was central to the company'sbusiness, and without patent protection for that technology and the products whichembodied it, Moddha would not be able to commercially profit from it.2. Lies About Moddha's Ability to Buyback ""Share Dividends""39. Since at least 2015, when offering Moddha securities, Sandor andPorrazzo communicated to investors and potential investors that Moddha was a safeinvestment because they would at least get all of their invested capital back throughModdha's ""founder's"" share program.40. Sandor and Porrazzo represented that if investors purchased Moddha'ssecurities within a limited window of time, investors would receive ""founder's""shares that provided an automatic share dividend equal to the amount invested; inother words, a ""two for one"" deal. For example, a purchase of 100 ""founder's"" shareswould entitle the investor to an immediate dividend of another 100 shares.41. Sandor and Porrazzo also told investors that Moddha was on the cusp ofreceiving a large infusion of capital that would allow the company to buy back thedividend shares, thereby returning the investor's capital while still giving them theability to participate in future gains.42. In 2015, Porrazzo and Sandor claimed that this impending infusion ofcapital was going to come from a wealthy investor who would put $ 150 million intoModdha.43. In one case, in or about 2015, Sandor showed an investor an email thatpurportedly confirmed another person's commitment to transfer $150 million toModdha.COMPLAINT 9Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 10 of 27     PageID #: 10 44. As time passed, however, and the investor questioned Porrazzo andSandor about when the capital infusion would in fact occur, Sandor provided thatinvestor with increasingly absurd explanations for the delay.45. Sandor claimed first, that the $150 million investor was sick, and thenthat he was delayed by a shooting at a foreign embassy, and finally that the $150million payment was held up because the investor's flight had been grounded by theeruption of an Icelandic volcano.46. In the end, the purported $ 150 million cash infusion never came, andModdha never returned the inquiring investor's funds.47. More recently, Sandor and Porrazzo have told investors that thecompany would be able to buy back investors' dividend shares with revenues from itscommercial relationship with the Global Telecommunications Firm.48. As just one example, Porrazzo and Sandor met in October 2017 with twopotential investors who owned a local business in Hawaii.49. After demonstrating Moddha's purported Q-Tablet and claiming that theproduct had been patented, Sandor also provided the potential investors with aPowerPoint presentation that prominently featured the Global TelecommunicationsFirm's trademark logo throughout, which was entitled ""[Global TelecommunicationsFirm] Business Case for Moddha Spatial 3D Q-Tablet & Software Apps.""50. In her transmitting email, Sandor told the potential investors that:As I mentioned, we have just become a registered supplier with[Global Telecommunications Firm]. I have included our veryCONFIDENTIAL MODDHA - [GLOBALTELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRM] Deck. (Please do notdistribute). It is only 7 slides and encapsulates much and willexplain the products we will be bringing to the market. :)51. Every slide of the PowerPoint presentation Sandor sent contained theGlobal Telecommunications Firm's trademark, and the presentation stressed amongother things that, ""[Global Telecommunications Firm] profits from the $113 billionCOMPLAINT 10Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 11 of 27     PageID #: 11 3D Display market, selling exclusive Moddha S3D Tablets.""52. The husband and wife business owners subsequently invested $500,000in exchange for 5,000 of the company's supposed ""founder's"" shares. Like otherinvestors, the couple were told by Sandor and Porrazzo that they would be receiving ashare dividend of another 5,000 shares, which they could quickly redeem withModdha through a share buyback, thus recouping their $500,000 capital investmentwhile still holding on to their original 5,000 shares of Moddha stock.53. In a November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor again touted thecompany's supposed dividend share buyback program: ""MODDHA intends to offera full cash redemption of your MODDHA Dividend Share Certificates at the issueprice the dividend was made equaling $100 per share ... To our knowledge and byour research, MODDHA is the only Private Company in history, who will have everprovided a 100% return dividend, and we are excited to blaze the trail for othercompanies to follow.""54. In this same November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor repeated theclaim that Moddha was ""now a Registered Supplier to [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm]"" and also included the same PowerPoint presentationcontaining the Global Telecommunications Firm's trademark.55. The November 3, 2017 shareholder update also included new claims that""the powerpoint [sic] ... was circulated amongst the higher ups of [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm] and received a resounding unanimous vote to partner withMODDHA. [The Global Telecommunications Firm] has requested to sell MODDHAproducts in all [the Global Telecommunications Firm's] Stores Nationwide. There isa desire from [the Global Telecommunications Firm] to co-brand the Q-Tablet andQuartz headset. We are considering the request.""56. Months later, after their share redemption still had not occurred, thehusband and wife Moddha investors received a January 2018 email from Sandorattempting to explain the delay:COMPLAINT 11Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 12 of 27     PageID #: 12 Greetings and Aloha MODDHA Shareholders ... This is a quicknote to let you know that our executive team, Fsicl were all downand offline for the past 5 weeks with this horrible high feverbronchial flu. Fortunately, we have all recovered and despite nothaving any holiday at all, nor any Christmas, nor New Year'scelebration with our families, we have made it through and aretoday back to work.We have been advised that there were some remaining ...documents required to be executed with [Moddha's transferagent.] We are now executing those documents so that [thetransfer agent] can be fully empowered ... and provide therequired services for your share dividend redemption ... Althoughit was out of our control that our whole team came down with thisviolent influenza at such a critical moment, we wish to apologizeto each of you, for any hardship this delay, and/or our being out oftouch has caused to you.57. Then in April 2018, Sandor sent another shareholder update claimingthat the share buyback was merely awaiting ""final approval from securities counsel.""58. Despite Sandor's promises, Moddha has never redeemed the husbandand wife's ""founder's"" shares. The company has not returned any portion of the$500,000 they invested in the company last fall.59. Sandor and Porrazzo have never told investors that Moddha didn't havethe financial wherewithal to make a share buyback or that the claimed relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm was categorically false.60. From January 2017 to April 2018, the daily ledger balance on Moddha'sbank account has never exceeded $200,000.61. Moddha is not a ""Registered Supplier"" of the GlobalTelecommunications Firm.62. The Global Telecommunications Firm never authorized Moddha to useits name or trademark in connection with Moddha's solicitation of investors, or forany other purpose.COMPLAINT 12Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 13 of 27     PageID #: 13 63. The Global Telecommunications Firm has never asked to sell Moddhaproducts in any of its stores.64. Moddha has not received a single dollar in sales, licensing, or otherrevenue from the Global Telecommunications Firm.65. Moddha's, Sandor's, and Porrazzo's representations that investors wouldbe able to quickly recoup their invested capital, while still maintaining an equity stakein Moddha going forward, were important to Moddha investors. Moddha, Sandor,and Porrazzo's claims that the dividend share buyback would be paid for by,alternatively, an impending $ 150 million transfer from an individual investor, orrevenues generated through Moddha's commercial relationship with the GlobalTelecommunications Firm, were likewise significant to investors' decision to invest.That is because these false statements went to a fundamental feature of theinvestment Š the safety of the investment and whether Moddha investors wereguaranteed to at least the return of their invested capital.3. Misrepresentations About How Investor Funds Would Be Used66. Sandor and Porrazzo are the only signatories on Moddha's corporatebank accounts.67. Moddha's PPM contains a detailed description and table stating thatfunds raised from investors would be used on specific business-related costs.68. Among other things, the PPM stated that funds were to be used to ""buildand install the dedicated servers for the global network, to produce the Q-ConnectSmart Phone and Q-Tablet, to manufacture the ready prototype products, [and] todevelop and integrate the Wave Screen interface onto the QT products.""69. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo made specific representations toinvestors in personal meetings about how their investments would be used.70. For example, one investor was told, in or about summer 2015, thatModdha specifically needed the funds for manufacturing its Q-Tablet in China.71. Other investors understood from Porrazzo and Sandor that the moneyCOMPLAINT 13Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 14 of 27     PageID #: 14 they invested would be used by Moddha for its business, rather than for Porrazzo'sand Sandor's personal expenses.72. These representations concerning how Moddha, Porrazzo, and Sandorwould use money raised from the company's investors were false. Of theapproximately $827,025 in investor funds raised from January 2017 to April 2018,for instance, the majority of that money was diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo for theirpersonal use or to co-defendant Street as commissions.73. The following chart shows how the $827,025 of investor money wasdiverted to Sandor, Porrazzo and Street:n-Tvpe^ExpenseNet Transfers to Sandor's and Porrazzo's personalaccounts, including transfer to overseas account$221,373Commission payments to Spar Street, the sales agent$104,835Travel (including airfare, Airbnb, and hotels)$51,227Auto (including lease, service, and fuel)$15,372Retail (including grocery, liquor, and departmentstores)$13,830Restaurants$7,461ATM cash withdrawals$3,953Sandor and Porrazzo's charity in Kenya$2,200Percentage of Investor FundsŁ 51%74. Included in these funds diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo were amountsspent at retailers of products that have no evident business purpose, such as TheHome Depot, Liquor Barn, Target, and Walgreens.75. One egregious example occurred from November 19 to 26, 2017 duringThanksgiving week. In that week, Sandor and Porrazzo used Moddha investor fundsto stay at a luxury hotel in Santa Monica, California, where they spent upwards ofCOMPLAINT14Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 15 of 27     PageID #: 15 $2,400 a night on a room and purchased hundreds of dollars of food, drink, and spatreatments, including a $425 bottle of wine. All told, Sandor and Porrazzo's seven-night stay at the hotel was paid for with $15,884.01 in investor funds.76. In the same vein, on May 3, 2017, a Moddha investor transferred$50,000 to the company. Sandor and Porrazzo immediately misappropriated thesefunds, transferring $20,000 of that amount to Porrazzo's bank account the same day.77. And in the most recent set of corporate bank records obtained during theSEC's pre-filing investigation, Moddha's beginning account balance on April 1, 2018had dwindled to $6,036.91. On April 3, 2018, a Moddha investor transferred $50,000to the company. Once again, Sandor and Porrazzo quickly caused $10,000 ininvestor funds to be diverted to their personal and joint bank accounts, on the verysame day those investor funds first came in to Moddha's corporate account.78. In addition to these personal transfers, Sandor and Porrazzo spent$182,964 to satisfy two legal judgments against Moddha from January 2017 to April2018.79. In that time period, there is no indication in Moddha's bank records thatinvestor funds were used to manufacture QT products.80. Investors would have wanted to know that money raised by Moddha'sstock offering would not be used for working capital, as stated in the PPM, andinstead be diverted to Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street.C. The Scheme to Defraud Investors81. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated investor money bytransferring funds from Moddha's corporate account, for which Sandor and Porrazzowere the only two signatories, for their personal use.82. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo also gave potential and current investorsthe false appearance that Moddha's business was real, and that its supposed QTtechnology had already been incorporated into tangible and innovative products.83. Their artifice was simple, yet effective: Sandor and PorrazzoCOMPLAINT 15Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 16 of 27     PageID #: 16 demonstrated products in meetings with investors, including the Q-Tablet featured inthe company's offering materials, when in fact the products they showed investorswere made by unrelated companies and did not incorporate any of Moddha's claimedtechnology.84. In particular, the Q-Tablet - which did generate a 3D image that manypotential investors found impressive - used by Sandor and Porrazzo for productdemonstrations was instead designed and manufactured by a wholly-unrelated third-party technology company. In 2017, Sandor admitted to an investor consultant thatanother company owned and had developed the tablet used in Moddha'sdemonstrations, but insisted that Moddha owned 51 % of that other company. Whenpressed for documentation of Moddha's ownership, Sandor changed her story andsaid that the demonstration tablet had really been manufactured by a San FranciscoBay Area company that she refused to identify.85. Similarly, Moddha's offering materials contained images of otherproducts supposedly being developed by Moddha, including ""wearable technology,""""bone induction headphones,"" and a QT-powered speaker. Those images, though,were faked - the photos were of other companies' products that had been altered toappear as if they had been developed by Moddha.86. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo showed investors pre-produced videosthat purported to show Moddha's products working as claimed, but when an investorconsultant asked them to reproduce those results in a real-life setting, Sandor andPorrazzo refused to do so.87. Sandor and Porrazzo engaged in a bait and switch, enticing investors toinvest by telling them they would get a share dividend equal to 100% of theirinvestment (the bait), when in reality, Moddha lacked the funds to follow through ona promised buyback of investors' share dividend, and instead gave investorsprogressively more absurd excuses as to why the new funding never came (theswitch).COMPLAINT 16Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 17 of 27     PageID #: 17 88. Sandor and Porrazzo also lied to investors to lull them into believingnothing was wrong and to avoid any detection of their fraud.89. In November 2017, Sandor","The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to halt an ongoing offering fraud carried out by Marianne Veronika Sandor, her husband Edward Michael Porrazzo and their company, Moddha Interactive, Inc.The SEC's complaint, which was unsealed on July 13, in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo told investors that Moddha Interactive had a valuable portfolio of patents for a supposed 3-D technology that can be used with tablet devices. As alleged in the complaint, however, this was false because Moddha Interactive's patents had expired and were worthless, and the technology they promoted either did not exist or was developed by other, unrelated companies. Also, according to the SEC's complaint, in an effort to promote the safety of the investment in Moddha Interactive, Sandor and Porrazzo lied about a share dividend buy-back program and how they would use the investor funds they raised. The complaint alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds to support their lifestyle. In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that Moddha Interactive paid over $200,000 in sales commissions to their co-defendant, Spar Street, who illegally acted as an unregistered broker in selling Moddha Interactive's shares to investors.The SEC's complaint, filed under seal on July 9, 2018, charges Sandor, Porrazzo and Moddha Interactive with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint also charges Street with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as other emergency relief. The SEC's complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jasmine M. Starr and Carol Shau and supervised by Victoria A. Levin of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gary Leung and supervised by Amy J. Longo."
44,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUTSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, v.TEMENOS ADVISORY, INC., andGEORGE L. TAYLOR,Defendants.Case No.JURY TRIAL DEMANDEDCOMPLAINTPlaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁthe Commissionﬂ)alleges the following against Defendants Temenos Advisory, Inc. (ﬁTemenos"")and its principal, George L. Taylor (ﬁTaylorﬂ),and hereby demands a jury trial:SUMMARY OF THE ACTION1.Temenos is a Connecticut-based investment adviser and Taylor is the majority owner of Temenos and also holds several positions at the firm, including chief executive officer(ﬁCEOﬂ).  From 2014 through 2017, Temenos and Taylor defrauded their advisory clients and prospective clients by steering the clients into unsuitable investments and by hiding commissions and other financial incentives that Temenos and Taylor were pocketing, on top of the advisory fees that the clients were paying for supposedly unbiased financial advice. Temenos and Taylor repeatedly downplayed or concealed risks, and overstated potential gains, associated with a series of illiquid private placements that they advised their clients and prospective clients to invest in.  In so doing, Defendants promoted the investments and pocketed commissionsŠaCase 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 1 of 43 2percentage of each client™s investmentŠfrom the private placement companies, thereby illegally acting as unregistered broker-dealers.  2.Through their conduct, Temenos and Taylor violated the fiduciary duty that every investment adviser owes to its clients and prospective clientsŠto put client interests first,to deal with clients with the utmost honesty, to disclose all conflicts or potential conflicts of interest, and to use reasonable care in providing investment advice.  Instead, Defendants ignored their clients™ interests and biased their investment advice to put money in their own pockets.The advisory clients and other investors harmed by the Defendants included retail investors, and some of the harmed investors were senior citizens or individuals approaching retirement who invested money from their retirement funds or pension plans into the private investments recommended by the Defendants.  3.In connection with steering clients into four private placement investments, Temenos and Taylor breached their fiduciary duty to advisory clients and prospective clients by:failing to perform due diligence commensurate with even minimal fiduciary obligations (such as reviewing full financial information and investigating the truth of claims made by the issuers);failing to disclose known defects that came to their attention, such as:a company™s poor financial condition, questionable spending practices, potential liabilities, misstatements and omissions in the companies™ marketing materials, and dubious claims by one company about its technology;aggressively pushing advisory clients to invest in securities in which Temenos and Taylor had undisclosed conflicts; Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 2 of 43 3recommending investments that they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, were not suitable or appropriatefor particular investors;grosslyunderstatingsignificant risks of investing in private placementsgenerally;intentionally making numerous materially false and misleading statements and materially incomplete disclosures concerning the potential risks, returns, and value of particular private placements;failing to disclose Temenos™s own failing financial condition;giving preferential treatment to a partial owner of Temenos (the trust for which Taylor served as trustee), by permitting it to redeem its principal investment in an illiquid investment(a privilege denied to other clients); andovercharging clients™ advisory fees by overvaluing the private placement investments, in violation of Temenos™s own written policies. 4.Temenos and Taylor also played an extensive role in soliciting the private placement investmentsin exchange for commissions from the private companies.  In doing so,they illegally acted as unregistered broker-dealers when selling those investments.5.Through the activities alleged in this Complaint,Temenosand Taylor,while acting as investment advisers,have employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud their investment advisory clients and have engaged in acts, transactions, practices and courses of businesses which operated as a fraud on their investment advisory clients,in violation of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ).  Temenos violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Actand Rule 206(4)-7 thereunderby failing to implement its written valuation policy.Taylor aided and abetted that violation.  And,Temenos Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 3 of 43 4and Taylor violated Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) by inducing and attempting to induce the purchase and sale of securities without being registered as a broker or dealer or being associated with a registered broker or dealer6.The Commission seeks:a.entry of appropriate permanent injunctions, including an injunction prohibiting Defendants from further violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws; b.disgorgement of Defendants™ill-gotten gains, pluspre-judgment interest;and, c.imposition of civil penaltiesdue to the egregious nature of Defendants™violations. JURISDICTIONAND VENUE7.The Commission seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement pursuant to Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act [15U.S.C. §80b-9(d)]and Section21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)].The Commission seeks the imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to Section 209(e) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §80b-9(e)]andSection 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)].8.The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78aa]and Sections 209(d), 209(e) and 214 of the Advisers Act [15U.S.C. §§80b-9(d), 80b-9(e), 80b-14].9.Venue is proper in this District because, at all relevant times,Temenos and Taylor operated as investment advisersand served advisory clients in Connecticut.  In addition, the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business constituting the alleged violations occurredin Connecticut.Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 4 of 43 510.In connection with the conduct described in this Complaint, Defendants directly or indirectly made use of the mails or the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce.11.Defendants™conduct involved fraud, deceit, or deliberate or reckless disregard of regulatory requirements, and resulted in substantial loss, or significant risk of substantial loss, to other persons.DEFENDANTS12.Temenos Advisory, Inc. is a Connecticut corporation founded by Taylor with its principal place of business in Litchfield, Connecticut and additional offices in St. Simons Island,Georgia, and Scottsdale, Arizona.  Temenos has been registered with the Commission as an investment adviser since 1999, and is owned by George Taylor anda trust that was set up for the benefit of Taylor™s former business partner.13.George L. Taylor,age 62, is a resident of Litchfield, Connecticut.  Taylor is the CEO, founder, Chief Compliance Officer, and majority owner of Temenos.  Taylor is also aregistered representative of a broker-dealer that is not affiliated with Temenos.Taylor is registered as aGeneral Securities Representative, aGeneral Securities Principal, an Investment CompanyProducts/Variable Contracts Principal, and aUniform Securities Agentwith the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency.Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 5 of 43 6STATEMENT OF FACTSA.Defendants Took Money to Recommend the Securities of Private Placement Companies, and Did So Without Conducting Adequate Due Diligence14.Before 2014, Temenos and Taylor had invested their advisory clients™ money primarily in mutual funds, exchange traded funds, variable annuities, and publicly traded stocks.  They charged an asset management fee to their clients based on the clients™ total assets under their management.  15.Starting in 2014, Temenos and Taylor began actively recommending the privately offered securities of four private companies to Temenos™s clients and prospective clients.  Between 2014 and 2017, Defendants placed more than $19million in investments by their clients and others inthese four private issuers™ securities.  And they did so without ever sufficiently examining the marketing claims, financial statements, or the business activities of those companies.   16.Critically, by steering their clients™ investments into those securities of the four private companies, Temenos and Taylor arranged to covertlycollect commissions (a percentage of the amount invested) on top of the asset management fees their clients were already paying for unbiased advice.  Although their due diligence was inadequate, their financial incentives to recommend these private securities offerings were not.1.Temenos and Taylor Agreedto Commission-Based Solicitation Agreements with Private Placement Companies17.Defendants recommended their clients invest in the securities offerings of at least four private companies:Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 6 of 43 718.CompanyAmarketedan emergency response communications product.  Beginning on or about April 25, 2013, Company Aengaged in a private placement securities offering.19.Temenos and Taylorsolicited investments in Company A.  Between February 2014 and February2017,Temenos solicited approximately $11.2million of investments in Company Afrom their advisory clients and otherindividuals(certain of whom later became advisory clientsof Temenos).From September 2014 through February 2017, pursuant to a ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ agreement with Company A, Temenos solicited investments in Company A as its ﬁfinder.ﬂ  From October 2014 through February 2017, Company A compensated Temenos for Temenos™s role in the private placement.Temenos, at Taylor™s direction and under his signature as CEO, enteredintoa ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ with Company A, effective September 1, 2014.  Under that agreement, Temenos received money equal to 2.5% of each investment it brought to Company A.  On September 9, 2015, Temenos and Company A extended that agreement and changed the compensation that Temenos received.  Under the extended agreement, Temenos received 5% of each investment it brought to Company A.20.Company Bpurportedto be building a fiber optic connection between locations along the east coast of the UnitedStates.Beginning on or about January 15, 2015, Company Bengaged in a private placement securities offering.21.Temenos and Taylor solicited investments in Company B.  Between September 2014and March 2017, Temenos solicited approximately $7 million of client investments in Company B. From January 2015 to August 2015, Temenos solicited investments in Company B through a solicitation arrangement with anintermediary.  Temenos, at Taylor™s direction and Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 7 of 43 8under his signature, entered into a ﬁNon-Exclusive Placement Agency Agreementﬂ with Company B effective August 1, 2015.Under that agreement, Temenos received a fee equal to 5% in cash and 5% in equity(that is, an ownership stake in Company B)of each investment brought to Company B.  From September 2015 through February 2017,Company B compensated Temenos directly for Temenos™s role in the solicitations.22.Company Cmarketed itselfduring the relevant time periodas a crowdfunding investment portal.Company C™s founder and president is a former registered representative of a broker-dealer.Prior to founding Company C,he owned a companythat had a solicitation agreement with CompanyB.Company Cemploys Taylor™s wife as Managing Director, Customer Experience.  Prior to that, she served as Principal Director of Investor Strategies.  She received stock options in Company C as part of her compensation.  For a short time, DefendantTaylor served on Company C™s investment committee.  Beginning on or about March 18, 2016, Company Cengaged in a private placement securities offering.  23.Temenosand Taylor solicited investments in Company C.  Between March 2016 and January 2017, Defendants solicited $805,000 of client investment in Company C. 24.In the meantime, shortly after Temenos and Taylor began soliciting investments in Company C from their clients, Temenos and Taylor began to receive undisclosed payments from Company C.  On July 6, 2016,Company C™s CEO confirmed that Temenos would receive a fee equal to 7% of each investment it brought to Company C in cash, and 5% more in Company C equity.  On July 15, 2016, Company C offered Taylor an additional financial incentive to solicit investments, promising Taylor an additional 25,000 options on purchasing Company C stock once Defendants had successfully solicited $500,000 of investments for Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 8 of 43 9Company C.  The email between the CEO and Taylor acknowledges that Temenos would have Temenos™s advisory clients invested in Company C,and that Taylor would also be marketing Company C to non-clients as well to people ﬁbeyond [Taylor™s] own contacts.ﬂFrom August 2016 through December 2016, Company C compensated Temenos for Temenos™s solicitations.  In December 2016, Temenos, at Taylor™s direction and under his signature, entered into a ﬁFinders (sic) Agreementﬂ with Company C, retroactively effective as of February 10, 2016.  Under that agreement, Temenos received money equal to 7% of each investment itbrought to Company C.25.Company Dpurported to have developed a new water purification technology.In or around early August 2015, approximately one month after two of the three Temenos advisory clients who invested in Company Dhad completed their investments,the owners of Company D™s parent companyfired Company D™s president, and withdrew all the money from Company D™s checking account. 26.Temenos and Taylor solicited $225,000of client investments in Company D.  From in or about December 2014 to in orabout July 2015, Temenos, through Taylor, solicited investments in Company D.  Taylor expected that Company D would pay Temenos a 5% finder™s fee for investments in Company D from Temenos clients.2.Despite Their Representations, Defendants Failed to Conduct Even the Basic Due DiligenceNecessary to Determine Whether the Private Placement Investments Were Suitable for Its Clients27.Throughout the relevant period, Taylor made statements to clients that misleadingly suggested that the private placement investments Temenos offered had been carefully vetted and selected from a large group of potential offerings based on their favorable Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 9 of 43 10risk/return potential, and were suitable for any wealthy investor.  They weren™t.  Defendants did not perform adequate due diligence before recommending that advisory clients invest in the private placement companies.  Instead, they recommended those investments without even the most basic information on the companies necessary to judge the risks and rewards of those investmentsand with a reckless disregard for the truth of their statements about those investments.28.Defendants repeatedly represented that they had performed due diligence on the private placement investments and that the investments were suitable for their clients.  For instance:a.In emails sent to clients and other prospective investors in December 2014, May 2015, and December 2015, Taylor wrote, ﬁWe are fortunate to see many opportunities in the private equity space.  We try to select those which are lower risk (all private equity is risky), those which exhibit exceptional return potential and those which are helping to make our country a better place.ﬂb.On May 7, 2015, Defendants emailed numerous advisory clients and others soliciting themfor an investment in Company B informing clients that Temenos sees many opportunities to invest in private companies and tries to select those which are lower risk, exhibit exceptional return potential, and help make the country a better place.  c.In a December 2016 email to advisory clients and others, Taylor stressed that all of Temenos™s private issuer securities offerings ﬁhave strong management teams and compelling business models.ﬂCase 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 10 of 43 11d.In a February 2017 email to advisory clients and others, Taylor stated, ﬁwe don™t recommend every investment that we have access too [sic]. . . we have a process of due diligence and vetting.ﬂ In making these claims about the selection of investment opportunities, Defendants failed to notify investors that, in fact, they had not independently assessed the risk or return potential of these companies.  Moreover, Defendants omitted to mention a key selection criterion for the private companies in questionŠthe willingness of those companies to pay Taylor for every client dollar steered to those companies.29.Defendants recommended advisory clients and prospective clients invest in these private companies without doing sufficient due diligence to determine the risk of those investments, the financial stability of those companies, the business prospects of the companies, or the suitability of the investments for particular clients.  They forwarded emails from these companies to their advisory clients and prospective clients without performing even minimal due diligence, withoutadequate effort to determine the accuracy of the representations they were sending to advisory clients, and with reckless disregard for the truth of those representations.For instance:a.Defendants did not review financial statements for Company B prior to touting Company B to clients and prospective clients.  Defendants began placing client funds into Company B in January 2015, well before they ever saw Company B™s financial information.When, much later, in July 2015, Defendants saw full financial information about Company B, they discovered that Company B did not Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 11 of 43 12have enough money to build the fiber optic line itclaimed to be building, and was using most of its money for marketing instead. b.Defendants failed to discoverand/or disclosethat, between March 2015 and March 2016, several lawsuits were filed against Company B and that Company B lost control of a key land parcel, which significantly jeopardized Company B™s ability to build its fiber optic line;c.Defendants did not conduct due diligence on Company Cbefore recommending their clients invest.  Instead Defendants relied only on their uninformed, subjective opinion thatCompany C had good legal counsel and a good compliance firm.d.Defendants™ due diligence on Company D was limited to reading the company™s business plan and sending that information to a couple of Defendants™ clients who were engineers.  One of those engineer clients bluntly notified Defendants that CompanyD™stechnology was ﬁa bunch of crap.ﬂ  Taylor also declined an invitation from Company Dfor Taylor to visit the Company Dfacility and view its technology.  e.On June 28, 2015,Taylor emailed a prospective investor, unreservedly recommending an investment in Company D and asking for more investment money based onhis great results.  Without having conducted due diligence on the company, Taylor wrote that, ﬁ– by July they will be increasing the value of the company from 10 million val[uation]to $100 mill[ion]ﬂ and represented that the company would sell every unitthey make and become a dominant ﬁindustry Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 12 of 43 13disruptorﬂ that would be an ﬁ$8 billion business.ﬂTaylor also statedthatthe odds wereﬁ[o]ver 60% that technology will work as claimedﬂ and ﬁ[i]t succeeds you will get at least 10 to 25 times your investment–.ﬂHe had no basis for either the supposed calculation of the odds the technology would work or for the expected return on investment if it did.30.Defendants also disregarded negative information contained in the financial statementsof some of the private companies, and failed to disclose this negative information to advisory clientsor prospective clientswhen they solicited them to invest.  For instance,Defendants knew that Company Bhad been rapidly using up its available cashand may be facing insolvency, but nevertheless recommended their clients invest in Company Band collected its resulting commissions.31.Defendants failed to corroborate the claims they later made to advisory clients and others about the private placement companies.  Defendantsdid notobtain sufficient information to determine the merits and suitability of the private companiesas investments they recommended to their advisory clients and prospective clients.  Nor did they corroborate the information they received from the private placement companiesin connection with their provision of investment advice.  Instead, in many cases, Defendants blindly forwarded and/or parroted informationreceivedfrom the privateplacementcompanies.Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care, failed to conduct sufficient due diligence, failed to make an investigation that would provide them with a reasonable basis to believe their representations about the private placement companieswere true and accurate, andfailed to obtain the Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 13 of 43 14information necessary to determine whether the investments were suitable for their current and prospective advisory clients.3.Defendants Failed Adequately to Inform Clients thatThey Were Getting Paid by the RecommendedPrivate Placement Companies, On Topof the Clients™ Advisory Fees32.Though they were actively engaged in, and compensated for, soliciting investments in the private placement companies, prior to March 31, 2015, Temenos did not disclose to its advisory clients that it received compensation from the private placement companies.Registered investment advisers are required to file with the Commission a document called the Form ADV, which is a uniform form used to register with the Commission or, in some instances, a statesecurities regulator.  Form ADV contains a variety of disclosures about the adviser and its advisory business that must be updated at least annually.  Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 26, 2014, makes no mention of private placement or private equity investments.   Beginning in March 2015, Temenos includedagenericdisclosure in its Form ADVabout the possibility that it might receive ﬁfinder™s feesﬂ for private equity investments.  Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 31, 2015, states, ﬁ[w]e have and may receive finder™s or consulting fees for recommending certain private placements or private equity deals.  Typically these are only done with accredited investors whom we decide these types of investments are suitable for.ﬂ  In its FormsADVPart II,datedJanuary 15, 2016and March 31, 2017,Temenos provided slightly more disclosure,statingthat:ﬁWe may get paid a finder™s fee or consulting fee for offering these typeof [private] investments to our clients –.  Our compensation will vary, but typically has ranged from zero to 10%.  This could include cash or stock compensation.ﬂ Temenos™s Form ADV Part II general disclosure about the possibility of Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 14 of 43 15receiving compensation was, at best, a half-truth, failingto alert clients that Temenos and Taylor were pocketing commissions whenthey put clients into particular private offerings, even while the clients were paying advisory fees.  Such general disclosures were insufficient to enableclients to make an informed decision on whether to invest in a particular security, or to retain Temenos as an adviser.  While after March 31, 2015, Temenos had generally disclosed that it ﬁmayﬂ receive a finder™s or consulting fee, it failed to tell clients and prospective clients that it, in fact, was routinely receiving feesfor investments in the private placement offeringsand that the fees were many times larger than the advisory fees the clients were paying for advice.  Nor did Temenos notify clientswhen Temenos and/or Taylor were being compensated by receiving ownership interests in the companies, and what effect that conflict of interest had on Temenos™s investment advice.  33.In particular, Defendants repeatedly failed altogether to tell clients that Defendants were getting paid by the private companies at the times when Defendants were soliciting and investing clients™ funds in those companies™ offerings.  For instance, on March 6and 19, 2015;May 7and 23, 2015; June 23, 2016;August 2, 2016;November 25, 2016;and December 27, 2016,Defendants sent emails to numerous advisory clients and otherprospective investors soliciting investments in Company B.These emails did not disclose that Temenos expected to receive as compensation from Company B a percentage of the amount invested, nor was this information disclosed to those who expressed interest in the investments.34.The disclosures Defendants did make were incomplete and misleading.  For example, on December 10, 2014, Defendants disclosed to approximately 35 advisory clients that Temenos would receive as compensation 3% of the amount investedin Company B.Numerous Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 15 of 43 16additional prospective investors received only later emails, which did not contain any such disclosure. By August 1, 2015, Temenos™scompensation from Company Bhad increased to 5%of the amount invested, but Defendants did not disclose the increase, even to those who had been told about the 3% fee.Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients who theyrecommended invest in Company B.35.On August 15, 2015, Defendants emailednumerous advisory clients and others soliciting investments in Company A.This email did not disclose that Temenos expected to receive a percentage of the amount invested in CompanyAfrom Company Aas compensation.On September 23, 2015;November 19, 2015; December 4, 2015; January 13, 2016; April 22, 2016; May 16, 2016;June 20, 2016; August 17, 25,and 31, 2016; September 30, 2016; October 17, 2016;November 25, 2016; December 27, 2016;and January 10, 2017,Defendants sent additional emails tonumerous Temenos advisory clients soliciting investments in Company A.  None of these emails disclosed that Temenos expected to receive as compensation a percentage of the amount invested.Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients whothey recommendedinvestin Company A.  36.On August 2, 2016;September 19, 2016;October 18, 2016;December 27, 2016;January 23, 2017;and January 26, 2017, Defendants emailed numerous advisory clients and others soliciting investments in Company C.Several of these emails attached Company C marketing materials.  Defendants did not disclose that Temenos expected to receive as compensation from Company C a percentage of the amount invested in Company C.  Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients who were considering investing in Company Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 16 of 43 17C.  The January 23, 2017 email also disclosed that the CEO of Company C was associated with Temenos, but inaccuratelyreferred to him as an ﬁSEC advisor.ﬂ  37.Defendants failed to disclose several other actual or potential conflicts of interest to clients and potential clients when recommending investments in the private offerings.  For instance:a.Defendants did not disclose to clients that both Temenos and Taylor, personally, were under financial stress and were struggling to meet operating expenses when they recommended that clients invest in securities for which they received, as compensation, a commission based upon the amount invested.b.Defendants did not disclose their expected ownership interests in Company B or Taylor™s expected ownership interests (or, for certain clients solicited at the end of 2016,Taylor™s wife™s ownership interestsin the form of equity options)in Company Cwhenadvising their clients about Company B, Company C,or Company C-related investments, when soliciting their clients for investment in Company C, or when recommending their clients invest in securities offered through Company C™s crowd-fundingplatform.  c.Defendants did not disclose that Taylor had become actively involved in helping the management of Company Bas a member of Company B™s Finance Committee,and, for a time,was part of an ﬁadvisory committeeﬂ for Company C.38.By failing to disclose this information to advisory clients and prospective clients who were solicited to invest in these companies, while holding themselves out as investment Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 17 of 43 18advisers, Defendants intentionally made fraudulent misrepresentations and material omissions to those clients and prospective clients.  4.Defendants Improperly Placed Clients in Unsuitable and Highly Risky Investments39.Defendants recommended the private placement companyinvestments to allof theirinvestor clientswho they believed to have sufficient income, regardless of whether those risky investments were right for a particular client.  They emailed numerous advisory clients, recommending thatclients invest in the private companies™ securities, without concern for the clients™ personal circumstances or risk tolerance.  For example:a.In June 2016, Taylor told over 100clients by email that, ﬁ[m]utual funds and separate accounts are expensive and inefficient. . .ﬂ and ﬁ[w]ith our accredited investors, private equityis a key component to increase potential return and to decrease overall risk.ﬂb.On February 13, 2017, Defendants sent a mass email to Temenos clients stating, ﬁ[w]e believe that wealthy investors should have some private equity investment–.ﬂ and, ﬁ[i]ncluding more and different types of private equity companies increases the odds that one will be successful in this asset class Œas in all others.ﬂ  Defendants should not have been soliciting from their entire client base to invest in the private companies™ securitiesŠinvestments which were inherently high risk and illiquid with a long-term and indefinite time horizon.  40.Defendants continually recommended these private placement investments to specific advisory clients and prospective clients regardless of the suitability of the investments Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 18 of 43 19for that client.  For several clients whom Defendantsconvinced to invest in those private placementofferings, those investmentswere wholly unsuitable when considering the clients™inability to tolerate the risk of losing money on the private placement investments and when considering the time by which the clients would need to liquidate their investments to use the invested funds.  For instance, Defendants placed two-thirds of one particularclient™s retirement funds into private placement investments.  This client, a52-year-old womanwith arisk averseinvestment approach,had transferred to Temenos all of her retirement funds(approximately $350,000), which had previously been invested in a diverse portfolio ofmutual funds and publicly traded common stock.  Defendants advised her to sell most of those investments in order to invest in three of the private placementinvestments.  Taylor told the client that the investments would earn her a higher rate of return for the fifteen years she plannedto continue working.  The client knew the companies she had invested in were not yet publiclytraded, but did not understandthe risks associated with investing in private placements.  Defendantsdid notexplain to her thatthese private placements we","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut investment advisory firm and its chief executive officer with putting $19 million of investor money, including elderly investors' retirement savings and pension plans, in risky investments and secretly pocketing hefty commissions from those investments.The SEC's complaint alleges that Temenos Advisory, Inc. and George L. Taylor steered advisory clients and other investors, including senior citizens and individuals approaching retirement, into four risky, illiquid private offerings. While Temenos and Taylor charged advisory fees for unbiased financial advice, they allegedly concealed from their clients the high commissions they were pocketing from these risky and unsuitable investment recommendations, including cash and ownership stakes in the private companies they recommended, and fraudulently misled clients about the risks and prospects of the investments. The SEC also alleges that Temenos and Taylor grossly overbilled some of their advisory clients.The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Connecticut, charges Temenos and Taylor with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.The case is being handled by Dawn Edick, Marc Jones, Rua Kelly, Patrick Noone, and Amy Gwiazda. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Maria Viana, Kenneth Leung, and Mayeti Gametchu of the Boston office."
