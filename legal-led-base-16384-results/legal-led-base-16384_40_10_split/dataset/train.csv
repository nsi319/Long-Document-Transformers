24,"1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA SAVANNAH DIVISION     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,   Civil Action File No. v.      4:18-CV-00209-WTM-GRS  ROBERT WILLIAM DORRANCE,    Defendant.     AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF   The plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint and alleges the following: SUMMARY 1. Between at least January 2015 and February 2016, Defendant Robert William Dorrance (ﬁDorranceﬂ) aided and abetted a scheme by David R. Greenlee (ﬁGreenleeﬂ) and David A. Stewart, Jr. (ﬁStewartﬂ) that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors.   2. During this time, Greenlee, Stewart, their principal salesman, Richard P. Underwood (ﬁUnderwoodﬂ), and other salesmen whom Greenlee and Stewart recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold interests in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. 3.   In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to (a) acquire ﬁworking    2 interestsﬂ in various oil wells and (b) employ enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells.  Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also told investors that the entities would sell the oil in order to earn for investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent, or more, per year ﬁfor decades.ﬂ 4. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, Southern Energy Group, Inc. (ﬁSEGﬂ), which is now administratively dissolved, and Black Gold Resources, Inc., which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc. (ﬁBGR/Tennstarﬂ). 5. Greenlee, Stewart, and Underwood represented to investors that SEG would manage the limited partnerships and BGR/Tennstar would manage the joint ventures, and that each of these companies would be headed by an individual with meaningful experience in the oil industry. 6. Greenlee and Stewart installed figurehead executives for SEG and BGR/Tennstar who pretended to run the companies so that Greenlee and StewartŠboth convicted felonsŠcould conceal their own involvement in the scheme. 7. Dorrance was the figurehead installed over SEG, and he knew that he was falsely portrayed to investors as both running the company and experienced in the oil industry. 8.  Dorrance also substantially assisted the fraud by transferring investor funds at the direction of Greenlee and Stewart from SEG accounts to accounts that he knew were under Greenlee and Stewart™s control. 9. Dorrance received significant compensation while serving as the figurehead executive for SEG.      3 VIOLATIONS 10. Dorrance, by virtue of his conduct, aided and abetted Greenlee™s and Stewart™s direct violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and (d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b)-(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)-(e)] to enjoin Dorrance from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar purport and object, for disgorgement of illegally obtained funds, prejudgment interest and other equitable relief, and for civil money penalties. 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. 13. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, has made use of the mails and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 14. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act and Exchange Act have occurred within the Southern District of Georgia.        4 DEFENDANT  15. Dorrance, age 61 and a resident of Bowling Green, Kentucky was the purported President of SEG between January 2015 and February 2016, when the fraudulent offering was halted.  He was selected by Greenlee and Stewart as SEG™s figurehead because he was the uncle of Greenlee™s spouse and willing to take the job.  For most of his working life, Dorrance was a stereo system salesman, who also periodically helped with administrative tasks at his spouse™s private place of business.  He has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. OTHER RELEVANT PEOPLE AND ENTITY 16. David R. Greenlee, age 42, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was convicted in state court and served time in a Kentucky prison during 1999 to 2000 for forgery and burglary, and again in 2004 for vehicular manslaughter. 17. David A. Stewart, Jr., age 47, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, is a former registered representative of two Commission-registered broker-dealers in 2001 and 2002.  In April 2007, Stewart was convicted of federal income tax evasion and sentenced to federal prison.  Later, in 2008, the Alabama Securities Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against Stewart, among others, for previously participating in a separate oil and gas offering scheme.   18. Southern Energy Group, Inc. was a Tennessee corporation and the purported manager of at least four limited partnerships offered to investors.  SEG was administratively dissolved by Tennessee in August 2016 for failure to meet registration renewal requirements.   19. On August 11, 2017, the Commission filed a complaint in SEC v. Tennstar Energy, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:17-cv-00151 (S.D. Ga.), alleging violation of the antifraud statutes of the federal securities laws by BGR/Tennstar, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood.      5 FACTS A. Background  20. Between at least January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlee and Stewart, acting individually and through a network of salesmen whom they recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests, called ﬁunits,ﬂ in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 21. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporationsŠSEG for the limited partnerships and BGR/Tennstar for the joint venturesŠeach of which they promoted as being run by an individual experienced in the oil industry. 22. In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in various oil wells, employ techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells, and sell the oil to earn investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent or more per year, claiming returns would last for decades. 23. In fact, while Greenlee and Stewart used some investor money at several wells to create an appearance of activity to dupe investors who wanted to see the wells in production, they used nearly two-thirds of the $15 million raised for their own benefit or to pay the costs of conducting the fraud, such as advertising and sales commissions. 24. Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also represented that SEG was led by an individual experienced in the oil industry.  In fact, SEG, was not managed by someone with experience in the oil industry.  Instead, Greenlee and Stewart installed a figurehead that had little    6 or no experience in the oil industry and created and distributed a false biography that misrepresented that the figurehead had significant relevant experience. 25. Given their criminal backgrounds, Greenlee and Stewart used fake names when soliciting investors to conceal their involvement in the scheme. B. Dorrance Substantially Assisted the Fraudulent Offering   26. Dorrance was the figurehead installed by Greenlee and Stewart in January 2015 to run SEG. 27. Dorrance was portrayed to investors as running SEG when, in reality, that entity was controlled by Greenlee and Stewart. 28. Dorrance knowingly allowed himself to be falsely portrayed to investors as running SEG and as being experienced in the oil and gas industry. 29. Specifically, Dorrance knew he was being presented to investors as SEG™s President even though he had no actual control over SEG.  Dorrance also knew that he had been given this title in order to allow Greenlee and Stewart, both of whom he knew were convicted felons, to conceal their own involvement in the scheme. 30. Dorrance acted in his role as SEG™s President solely at the direction of Greenlee and Stewart, who determined his compensation and instructed him in his day-to-day assignments. 31. Dorrance™s work tasks were typically clerical or administrative in nature and included moving investor funds, as instructed by Greenlee and Stewart, from SEG™s bank account to bank accounts of entities that he knew to be under the control of Greenlee and Stewart.    7 32. Dorrance also knowingly allowed Greenlee and Stewart to draft a fake biography of Dorrance and place that fake biography in SEG™s private placement memorandum (ﬁPPMﬂ).   Dorrance knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the PPM was distributed to investors.  33. This fake biography claimed that Dorrance had ﬁover 30 years of experience in finance, sales, oil & gas, and almost every capacity of corporate America.ﬂ  Dorrance knew this statement was false, at a minimum, because he had no work experience in the oil and gas industry. 34. Additionally, Dorrance knowingly allowed Greenlee and Stewart to feature him prominently on SEG™s website and in SEG brochures with false claims, among others, that he had ﬁ40 years of business experienceﬂ (10 more years than the claim in the PPM) and ﬁassociation[s] with some of the most capable and experienced professionals in the oil industry.ﬂ This too was false because Dorrance had no such associations. 35. For the approximately thirteen months that Dorrance purportedly served as  SEG™s President, he received $3,000 a week plus an occasional bonus, for a total of approximately $166,250Šall paid from investor funds.

Unless restrained and enjoined, Defendant Dorrance will continue to aid and abet violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]. COUNT II  Aiding and Abetting Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)]and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]  40.

Unless restrained and enjoined, Defendant Dorrance will continue to aid and abet violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)]and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].

IV.  An order directing Defendant Dorrance to pay disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains or unjust enrichment and to pay prejudgment interest on the amount ordered to be disgorged, to effect the remedial purposes of the federal securities laws.

VI.  Issue an Order that retains jurisdiction over this action in order to implement and carry out the terms of all orders and decrees that may have been entered or to entertain any suitable application or motion by the Commission for additional relief within the jurisdiction of this Court.    10       VII.

Last year, the SEC charged the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling investors that the funds would be used to acquire interests in wells and to recover oil from wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for their personal use. With no background in the oil industry, Dorrance's main work experience was as a former stereo salesman. He largely performed clerical and administrative work at the direction of the two convicted criminals.Dorrance agreed to be permanently prohibited from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay $101,075 in disgorgement plus interest, and $42,500 in civil penalties, for a total of $143,575.The SEC's continuing investigation is being handled by Brian M. Basinger, Stephen E. Donahue, and Edward G. Sullivan, all from the agency's Atlanta office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the U.S. Secret Service.The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."

COMPLAINT   Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint against Defendants Jared Jeffrey Davis (ﬁDavisﬂ) and Dale Burke Pinchot (ﬁPinchotﬂ) (collectively, ﬁDefendantsﬂ) and alleges as follows:  SUMMARY OF THE ACTION  1. From at least early 2012 through at least June 2016 (the ﬁRelevant Periodﬂ), Defendants Davis and Pinchot, operating through multiple private entities, engaged in the Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  1 of 15.  PageID #: 1 2  2. fraudulent offer and sale of binary options securities to investors. 3. During the Relevant Period, the Defendants collected at least $10 million in investor funds, of which they obtained a portion thereof, while neither was registered with the Commission as either a broker or a dealer nor while either was associated with a broker or dealer registered with the Commission. 4. In connection with the offer and sale of securities to investors, Davis violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)]; Sections 10b and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78o17 C.F.R. § 240.10b5]. 5. In connection with the offer and sale of securities to investors, Pinchot violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)]. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)]. 7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa], and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. 8. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)]. Acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein have occurred within the Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  2 of 15.  PageID #: 2 3  jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere. Moreover, the Defendants transacted business in this district. Venue also is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims discussed herein occurred within this district [28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)]. 9. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange in connection with the alleged acts, practices, and courses of business. DEFENDANTS 10. Jared Jeffrey Davis, born 1976, is last known to be a resident of Sandusky, Ohio. Davis and business partner Pinchot directly or indirectly owned multiple companies and internet websites that offered binary options securities trading to investors, and Davis served as the primary manager of the overall enterprise.   11. Dale Burke Pinchot, born 1970, is last known to be a resident of Yardley, Pennsylvania, and was the partner of Davis in the binary options business. STATEMENT OF FACTS A. Binary Options 12. A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely on the outcome of a yes/no, or binary, proposition or event such as whether the price of a particular underlying asset (e.g., an individual stock, an index of stocks, a currency, a commodity) will rise above or fall below a specified amount at a specified future point in time. 13. Once the option is acquired by the investor, there is typically no further decision for the investor to make regarding the exercise of the binary option because binary option Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  3 of 15.  PageID #: 3 4  contracts exercise automatically at expiration. 14. Unlike some other types of options, binary option contracts do not give the holder the right to buy or sell the specified underlying asset. When the binary option expires, the option holder typically receives an amount (sometimes referred to as the ﬁpayoutﬂ) that is either a pre-determined amount or a percentage return based on initial investment (i.e., the premium) or loses all or nearly all of his or her investment. For example, a binary option contract with Apple stock as its underlying asset might, on the question of whether or not the price of Apple stock will be above or below $X per share five minutes hence, offer investors terms of a 70% payout on a winning trade or a 100% loss of capital on a losing trade. 15. Given this all-or-nothing payout structure, binary option contracts are also sometimes referred to as ﬁall-or-nothing optionsﬂ or ﬁfixed-return options.ﬂ 16. Binary option contracts based on securities and securities-based indices are themselves securities and thus are subject to the federal securities laws. B. The Unregistered Binary Options Industry 17. The unregistered binary options industry is often composed of three primary components sometimes referred to as ﬁplatforms,ﬂ ﬁbrands,ﬂ and ﬁaffiliate marketers.ﬂ 18. Platforms, frequently based in Israel but sometimes based in other locations, such as Bulgaria, are, as the moniker implies, the foundation of the unregistered binary options industry.  19. Platforms offer services for a fee that other intermediaries, called brands (discussed below), purchase or license and that may include software related to (a) trade entry and execution services, (b) customer account and client relationship management (ﬁCRMﬂ), (c) access to investment products (i.e., various binary option contracts), and (d) back office IT Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  4 of 15.  PageID #: 4 5  support. Some platforms also provide introductions to affiliate marketers (described below). 20. Brands, also known in the unregistered binary options industry as ﬁprivate labels,ﬂ ﬁwhite labels,ﬂ or ﬁbrokers,ﬂ may be established with a relatively modest investment and typically operate under a trade name while contracting with a platform for trade, customer account, and back office systems and services. 21. Generally, brand operators, such as the Defendants, possess custody of customer funds, do not charge commissions on trades, and are the counterparty to each customer binary options transaction. 22. Affiliate marketers are independent entities who produce sophisticated internet marketing campaigns centered on ephemeral websites and videos promoting the purportedly extraordinary and easy profits that can be obtained through binary options trading (although some campaigns may not specifically mention binary options). 23. These internet marketing campaigns, including those hired by Davis, frequently employ false statements, false testimonials, and/or falsified trading results, created by the affiliate marketer, to lure potential victims in and to shepherd them, for a fee, to binary option brand websites such as those operated by the Defendants. C. Economics of the Unregistered Binary Options Industry and Binary Option Brands  24. The economic basis of the unregistered binary options industry as participated in by the Defendants is predicated upon the knowledge that, in the aggregate and utilizing sufficiently volatile underlying assets, investors are likely to win only slightly more than 50% of their trades. 25. By structuring binary option contracts such that investors will be credited, typically, with only a 70-85% payout on winning trades and a 95-100% loss of capital on losing Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  5 of 15.  PageID #: 5 6  trades, the binary options industry can rely on the almost equal distribution of trade outcomes (i.e., wins and losses) to, as with casinos, mathematically assure themselves of a profit over time. 26. Brands, such as those operated by the Defendants, derive their revenue from being the counterparty to losing customer trades and retaining what is forfeited by customers thereby. In other words, binary option brands, such as those operated by the Defendants, have a keen interest in having their customers lose money through binary options trading. 27. To better ensure this profitable (to the brand) outcome, at least some platforms offered their brand customers access to software services or protocols, sometimes referred to as ﬁrisk management,ﬂ that would further increase the odds against investor customers of the brands. 28. These risk management protocols, applied at the platform level to investor accounts at the request of the brand operator, act to increase the likelihood that a given customer™s binary option trades will ﬁloseﬂ (and the opposite can be done with the accounts of discouraged customers in order to induce them, via experiencing a limited number of winning trades, to keep trading and/or to deposit additional funds into their binary options trading account).  29. Thus, brands, such as those operated by the Defendants, in order to generate meaningful and ongoing revenue require three things: (i) that customers actively trade their binary options accounts (i.e., so that the effects of the math underlying the payout structure have an opportunity to apply); (ii) that that trading is unsuccessful (i.e., customers lose money to the brand via losing trades); and (iii) that a constant stream of new customers is found to replace those who have either lost all of their investment capital or who have closed their account after discovering that binary options trading is unlikely to prove a profitable long-term endeavor.  Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  6 of 15.  PageID #: 6 7  D. The Defendants™ Binary Options Business 30. During or before early 2012, the Defendants undertook steps, including the formation of various foreign shell companies with foreign bank accounts, to establish their first binary options brand, OptionMint (www.optionmint.com). 31. Over the next few years, the Defendants established an additional three brandsŠOptionKing (www.optionking.com), Option Queen (www.optionqueen.com), and OptionPrince (www.optionprince.com)Šadditional foreign shell companies with foreign bank accounts, and, operating at various times, three call centers (with employees) located in Sandusky, Ohio; Costa Rica; and Sint Maarten. 32. This binary options enterprise, referred to hereinafter as the ﬁEnterprise,ﬂ although co-owned by the Defendants, was at all times primarily managed by Davis. 33. During the Relevant Period, the Enterprise accepted, as customers, investors located throughout the United States and around the world and offered and sold to them binary option contracts on individual stocks, stock indices, currencies, and commodities collecting at least $10 million (in aggregate) from them thereby of which the Defendants obtained a portion thereof. 34. The offer and sale of binary option securities (i.e., those binary options based on securities and securities-based indices) by the Defendants and the Enterprise was not registered with the Commission, and neither were the Defendants or the Enterprise registered with the Commission as either a broker or a dealer, and nor were the Defendants associated with a broker or dealer registered with the Commission. 35. In connection with the offer, purchase (by investors), and sale of binary option securities, Davis, directly or indirectly through the Enterprise, engaged in the making of Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  7 of 15.  PageID #: 7 8  misstatements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading and obtained money or property from binary options securities investors thereby. For example, Davis (a) in Enterprise marketing emails and/or in Enterprise telephone sales scripts used by Enterprise call center employees (both of which were approved by Davis), misrepresented the number of successful binary option investors the Enterprise had and omitted the fact that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of his or her trades, (b) misrepresented the security of investor funds which were, in fact, comingled with the general funds of the Enterprise, (c) misrepresented the knowledge and experience of Enterprise employees who advised customers on binary options trading, (d) misrepresented the Enterprise™s interest in seeing its customers succeed by omitting to disclose the basic fact that the Enterprise, and thus the Defendants, effectively took the opposing position on each trade and thus required customers to lose money via binary options trading in order for the Enterprise and the Defendants to make money, and (e) failed to disclose that Davis and the Enterprise could and oftentimes would increase the odds against customer success via application of risk management protocols. 36. Davis also engaged in misstatements and omissions in the Terms & Conditions section of the OptionMint website (which he controlled). For example, although this section contained a risk disclosure statement, it was silent on the ability of Davis, via the Enterprise, to have risk management protocols applied to the accounts of winning customers. Similarly, although this section contained a disclosure that ﬁbonus moneyﬂ (an inducement, such as, for example, a matching $500 credit on a $500 deposit made in order to lure wavering prospective customers into opening and funding a binary options account) must be turned over (i.e., traded) 30 times before it could be withdrawn by the customer, it was silent on the fact that, Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  8 of 15.  PageID #: 8 9  mathematically, an investor was likely to lose all of his or her investment capital prior to achieving this turnover level. Finally, although this section discussed OptionMint™s ﬁknow-your-customerﬂ policy and the supposed need for obtaining certain identifying documents from customers, it was silent about the fact that Davis, via the Enterprise, could and would use those documents against customers who attempted to effect a debit/credit card chargeback once they realized that they had been misinformed about the realities of binary options trading. 37. Davis also, directly or indirectly through the Enterprise, engaged in a fraudulent scheme. In addition to Davis™s misrepresentations and omissions described above, Davis also directed Enterprise employees to (a) disseminate fake trading results to customers in an effort to get them to enter into binary option trades, (b) have risk management protocols applied to the accounts of ﬁwinningﬂ customers so that their subsequent trades would be less likely to win, and (c) ﬁburnﬂ certain customer accounts through excessive trading. 38. Pinchot, as a business partner, financier, and benefactor of the overall Enterprise, knew or should have known about the Enterprise™s operations and trading activities, including the misrepresentations and omissions described herein.

PageID #: 15","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an Ohio resident and his Pennsylvania business partner in connection with an unregistered and fraudulent binary options business.According to the SEC's complaint, Jared Jeffrey Davis and various shell companies controlled by Davis and his business partner, Dale Burke Pinchot, engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered binary option securities under the brand names OptionMint, OptionKing, Option Queen, and OptionPrince. According to the complaint, Davis misrepresented the number of investors who successfully traded binary options and failed to disclose that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of trades. The complaint alleges that Davis, Pinchot, and their companies effectively took the opposing position on each trade and therefore made money when customers entered into losing binary options trades. The complaint further alleges that Davis failed to inform investors that he frequently manipulated the options trading software to increase the odds of investor losses.To learn more about binary options fraud, see Investor Alert: Binary Options Websites may be Used for Fraudulent Schemes.The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio, charges Davis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and charges Pinchot with violating antifraud provision Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis and Pinchot consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any binary option security. The final judgments provide that the court will determine disgorgement and civil penalties at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio announced criminal charges against Davis on June 5, 2018.The SEC's investigation was conducted by James Thibodeau and Justin Sutherland of the Commission's Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley. The litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."

Achievement of the milestones entitled the company to significant payments under a product development agreement. Shen allegedly used this confidential information to illegally profit by purchasing shares in advance of three announcements concerning the achievement of those milestones. The SEC alleges that Shen's purchases took place during company blackout periods and in brokerage accounts that were not at the company's designated brokerage firm - both of which were expressly prohibited by the company's insider trading policy. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Shen shared material nonpublic information before the third announcement with a relative, with the intention that the relative trade and benefit from the trading. The relative purchased company shares one day before the announcement.The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Northern District of California, charges Shen with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction along with the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty. Shen agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Shen agreed to pay a total of $88,192, consisting of disgorgement of $40,622 plus prejudgment interest of $4,228, and a penalty of $43,342. Shen also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ian Dattner with the assistance of the Office of Market Intelligence, under the supervision of Lisa Deitch and Antonia Chion.

BRUCE J. FIXELLE, AURORA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, and GENESIS ADVISORY SERVICES CORP.,   Defendants,           18 Civ. ___________  COMPLAINT   Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), as and for its Complaint against defendants Bruce J. Fixelle (ﬁFixelleﬂ), Aurora Capital Management, LLC (ﬁAuroraﬂ) and Genesis Advisory Services Corp. (ﬁGenesisﬂ), alleges as follows: SUMMARY 1. Since at least 2014, and continuing through at least 2017, Fixelle, an investment adviser with a history of securities regulatory violations, made material misrepresentations to investors and used his investment fund, Aurora, and Aurora™s unregistered investment adviser, Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 1 of 17 PageID: 1 2  Genesis, to perpetrate a scheme to misappropriate investor funds.  The victims of Fixelle™s scheme were long-time friends and acquaintances, whose trust he earned through association in at least one local community group.  To these unsophisticated investors, Fixelle touted an investment strategy that consisted of buying securities in initial and secondary securities offerings, and selling them before the end of the initial trading day.  He told his prospects that his strategy ensured that he maintained liquidity for his clients at the end of each trading day and reduced risk by not holding the securities overnight.  He also told investors that he achieved substantial, positive returns. 2. In reality, by 2014, Fixelle had suffered earlier disastrous investment losses based on his trading strategy, and was facing mounting debts and outstanding judgments, including a $1.5 million judgment he owed to the Commission for prior violations of federal securities laws.  Moreover, by 2014, Fixelle had largely abandoned any investment strategy at all with his investors™ money.  Rather, he was instead using investor funds to pay his debts, personal expenses, and by at least 2016, to repay at least one other investor.   3. Fixelle never disclosed to his prospective or existing investors his personal or business financial problems, or his intention and practice of misappropriating their funds, until long after they invested with him.  On the contrary, Fixelle actively sought to deceive them through periodic account statements that he knowingly falsified, and which falsely purported to show positive returns.  Fixelle succeeded in inducing at least two investors, ﬁInvestor A,ﬂ and ﬁInvestor B,ﬂ into providing him with more than $300,000 since 2014 through these fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions.  VIOLATIONS  4. By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, Fixelle, Aurora and Genesis, directly or Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 2 of 17 PageID: 2 3  indirectly, singly or in concert, have engaged, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to engage in acts, practices, schemes and courses of business that constitute violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1), 80b-6(2) and 80b-6(4)], and Rule 206(4)-8 [17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-8] thereunder. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT  5. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred on it by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)], Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], and Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)], seeking to permanently restrain and enjoin Defendants from engaging in the conduct, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein, and for such other equitable relief as may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors.  6. The Commission also seeks a final judgment ordering Defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest thereon and to pay civil money penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)], Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)] and Sections 209(e) and 209(f) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(e) and 80b-9(f)] of the Advisers Act. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action, and venue lies in this District, pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), 77v], Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa], and Section 209(d) of the Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 3 of 17 PageID: 3 4  Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)].  Defendants, directly or indirectly, have made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in, and the means or instrumentalities of, interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein.  Some of these transactions, acts, practices and courses of business occurred in the District of New Jersey. DEFENDANTS 8. Fixelle, age 58, is a resident of Hillsdale, New Jersey, and is the principal of Aurora Capital Management, LLC and Genesis Advisory Services Corp.    9. Genesis is a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of business in Hillsdale, New Jersey.  Genesis is an unregistered investment adviser, solely owned and operated by Fixelle and it has one administrative employee.  Genesis was the general partner of Aurora, and Fixelle directed all trading decisions (to the extent he made any) for Genesis and Aurora.   10. Aurora is a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of business in Lodi, New Jersey.  Aurora was established in 2015, and represented to prospective investors that it is an unregistered limited partnership, managed by its general partner, Genesis.  FACTS A.  Background 11. In 1992, Fixelle founded Genesis Group L.P. (ﬁthe Genesis Fundﬂ), an unregistered investment fund he advised through Genesis, with initially approximately $1 to $1.2 million in investments.  By 2006, his strategy consisted of obtaining allocations of initial and secondary securities offerings from a network of brokers with whom he had developed relationships.  Fixelle™s stated strategy was to buy shares in these offerings, benefit from intra-Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 4 of 17 PageID: 4 5  day rises in trading prices, and then liquidate by the end of the trading day.   12. On May 21, 2014, the Commission entered an order (the ﬁOrderﬂ) against Fixelle, Genesis and another entity he controlled, finding that from June 2008 through November 2012, Fixelle traded or directed trading that violated Rule 105 in connection with 35 secondary and follow-on offerings.  Rule 105 was enacted to prevent manipulative short selling prior to public offerings, and it prohibits short selling securities during a defined restricted period, and then subsequently purchasing the same securities in a covered follow-on or secondary offering.   13. The Commission, with the consent of Fixelle and Genesis (who neither admitted nor denied the findings contained in the Commission™s order): (1) ordered Fixelle and Genesis to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Rule 105; (2) censured them; and (3) ordered them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $951,060.13, prejudgment interest of $140,488.48 and a civil money penalty of $492,394, for a total of $1,583,942.61.   14. Fixelle made only one partial payment of $100,000 due under the Order.  On January 13, 2016, the Commission obtained a final judgment from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against him and Genesis enforcing the Order.  SEC v. Genesis Advisory Services Corp., et al., 15 Civ. 8181 (D.N.J. Jan. 13, 2016).  Neither Fixelle nor Genesis has made any further payments in satisfaction of the Order, or the judgment of the District Court.  Beginning in 2014, in addition to his outstanding obligation to the Commission, public records reflect that Fixelle has faced hundreds of thousands of dollars in mounting debts. B. Defendants™ Material Misrepresentations and Scheme to Defraud Investors 15. In the midst of this growing financial pressure, Fixelle, beginning no later than 2014, began fraudulently inducing investments into Aurora, focusing his efforts on individuals Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 5 of 17 PageID: 5 6  whose trust he had gained from long associations at a local organizations.   16. To at least two of these individuals, Fixelle represented (as he had previously when marketing his Genesis Fund), that Aurora™s investment strategy consisted of purchasing shares of initial public offerings on the first day of trading, and closing those positions the same day Œ a strategy he claimed ensured liquidity, reduced overnight risk, and consistently yielded substantial positive returns.   17. These claims, as Fixelle knew, were false.  In reality, by 2014, Fixelle was seeking new investor funds primarily to pay his personal and family expenses and debts, and to make repayments to former investors, facts he never disclosed to these individuals.  Through his deception, Fixelle succeeded in obtaining more than $300,000 in investor proceeds from these two investors, all of which he misappropriated.  Investor A 18. Investor A is a resident of Bergen County, New Jersey, who met Fixelle approximately fourteen years ago through a local organization, and they became close friends.  From 2015 to 2017, Investor A invested a total of $274,000 with Fixelle and Aurora, and, despite demands for repayment, has received nothing in return. 19. Fixelle initially solicited Investor A™s investment by describing his purported expansive network of broker dealers, and his strategy of buying securities in initial public offerings and selling by the end of the day.  Fixelle boasted a rate of return of 10% or better to Investor A, and said that the return would be higher the more money he invested.    20. Fixelle also provided Investor A™s accountant with a written summary of his investment strategy (consistent with his oral representations), together with a ﬁPrivate Placement Memorandum & Subscription Agreement,ﬂ which identified Aurora as the investment Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 6 of 17 PageID: 6 7  partnership (with investors purchasing limited partnership interests) and Genesis as the managing or general partner of Aurora.   21. Investor A initially invested $150,000 with Aurora, in a series of payments from October through November 2015.  At no time before Investor A invested with Fixelle, did Fixelle ever disclose to Investor A his prior regulatory violations, his personal or business financial problems, or his intention and practice of misappropriating investor funds.    22. Defendants then sent Investor A account statements, signed by Fixelle as Aurora™s General Partner, that consistently reported steady, positive returns.  Defendants™ statement for the period October 19, 2015 through December 31, 2015 reported that Investor A™s $150,000 investment had risen to $152,760 by December 31, 2015.  The statement Defendants sent for the period January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 reported a 1.425% gain for that quarter. 23. In May 2016, after Defendants sent those statements, Investor A invested another $100,000 with Fixelle in two payments, and, in October 2017, an additional $24,000, for a total investment of $274,000.  Defendants sent Investor A™s accountant a statement for the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, which reported that Investor A™s total investment had climbed $32,134 in value as of that date Œ approximately 12% Œ for that calendar year. 24.  These statements, as Defendants knew, were fictitious.  Defendants sent the statements to deceive Investor A about the status of his investments and conceal Defendants fraud from Investor A, and also to induce additional investments from him.  Fixelle had not invested Investor A™s money Œ he misappropriated it.  Fixelle used Investor A™s $150,000 initial investment primarily to pay Fixelle™s sons, or for personal expenses such as credit cards, office rent, and condo association fees.   25. He also used Investor A™s initial $150,000 investment to pay his debts, including, Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 7 of 17 PageID: 7 8  on November 23, 2015, a payment Fixelle made to a business whose proprietors held a $250,000 judgment against Fixelle.   26. From Investor A™s second investment of $100,000, Fixelle used $20,000 in May 2016 to repay an earlier investor (ﬁInvestor Bﬂ), and another $40,000 to repay another individual as well.  Fixelle also misappropriated another $29,900 of Investor A™s investment by sending it to a business operated by Fixelle™s son.  27. Fixelle™s accountant, with the knowledge of and on behalf of Fixelle, also sent Investor A™s accountant statements that purported to represent Aurora™s account with the clearing broker-dealer, as evidence of Aurora™s ﬁunderlying statement of assets.ﬂ  On information and belief, however, Fixelle physically altered the broker-dealer™s statements before sending them to his accountant, so they would falsely reflect more than $600,000 in assets.  In truth Œ based on the broker-dealer™s records Œ the account held only $48.   28. In early 2018, Investor A made a redemption request to Fixelle for $50,000.  Fixelle, stalling, falsely claimed in a text message to Investor A that he had ﬁput in the request with [his] clearing firm,ﬂ and that the firm was ﬁrunning it up the flagpole.ﬂ  In June 2018, after Fixelle had still not honored Investor A™s redemption request, Fixelle visited Investor A™s office, and told him that his money was gone.  Fixelle offered to put Investor A™s name on the deed to his home and to get a new job to pay Investor A back, and also told him that he could send Fixelle to jail if he wanted.  Investor A has had no subsequent contact with Fixelle, nor any repayment of his $274,000.    Investor B 29. Investor B also is not a sophisticated investor, and met Fixelle in a local organization, approximately fifteen years ago.  Before he invested, Fixelle explained to Investor Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 8 of 17 PageID: 8 9  B that he engaged in day trading, and thus that he was liquid every night, meaning that he sold the securities before the day ended.  Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to September 2015, Investor B transferred a total of approximately $2.8 million to Fixelle for investment in the Genesis Fund, $45,000 of which he transferred within the past five years.  Over the same period, Investor B has been paid approximately $1.9 million, with the last payment occurring in February 2018, for $8,000.  At no time before Investor B invested did Fixelle ever disclose to Investor B his personal or business financial problems, or his intention and practice of misappropriating investor funds.    30. Fixelle sent Investor B an account statement dated September 30, 2017 that knowingly and falsely reflected a balance of $902,724.55.  In reality, however, Fixelle had lost or misappropriated much if not all of Investor B™s balance in the account.    31. In January 2018, Investor B asked Fixelle to liquidate approximately $210,000 from his accounts.  As he did with Investor A, Fixelle first attempted to stall Investor B, by falsely claiming there was an issue with the clearing company, and as a result Fixelle repaid only a small portion of Investor B™s investment.  In May 2018, Fixelle confessed to Investor B that his money was completely gone, and gave him empty promises that he would repay him from the sale of a property or from personal funds that he expected to receive.  Since the days immediately following Fixelle™s admission that Investor B™s money was gone, Investor B and Fixelle have not spoken.  32.  In fact, Investor B™s money was gone because, by no later than 2014, Fixelle was misappropriating much if not all of his funds, and using them to pay personal expenses and debts.  For example, on July 31, 2014, Investor B invested $8,000, which was deposited into a Genesis account at Wells Fargo that had a balance of $1,733.  Those funds were co-mingled with Case 2:18-cv-15026   Document 1   Filed 10/16/18   Page 9 of 17 PageID: 9 10  a $13,000 deposit from another Fixelle entity.  None of the money was invested.  It was instead spent as follows:   $4,439 to make payments on personal credit cards;   $5,463 to make a payment on a personal loan at Hudson City Savings and Loan;  $5,334 to pay Fixelle™s mortgage;   $200 to the ﬁBruce Fixelle Irrevocable Trustﬂ;  $950 withdrawn in cash; and   $2,666 to pay health insurance premiums.    33. In addition, some of Investor B™s redemptions were paid with funds from Investor A and other individuals.  As described above, Fixelle sent $20,000 of Investor A™s investment in May 2016 to fund Investor B™s redemption later that month.  In May 2015, Fixelle sent Investor B funds he had received from another individual to partially redeem $20,000 to Investor B.  In January 2016, Fixelle again sent Investor B funds he had received from still another individual, to partially redeem $40,000 to Investor B.

COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges and states as follows: INTRODUCTION  1. From approximately September 2013 through approximately July 2016, Defendant, Chad Anthony Lewis, solicited investors and assisted other sales agents in soliciting and raising money from investors in unregistered, fraudulent securities offerings conducted by .  Lewis did not hold any securities licenses; was not registered with the Commission; was not associated with Commission-registered broker dealers nor did he qualify for an exemption.  Lewis was thus not permitted to sell securities.   2. Both Aegis and 7S ects located in Texas.  Through Lewis and other sales agents, Aegis raised approximately $35 million from about 250 investors nationwide, and 7S raised approximately $7 million from at least 70 investors.  Lewis, through his work at Aegis Case 0:18-cv-61869-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 1 of 9 2  and 7S, earned approximately $625,000 in commissions from the sale of these Aegis and 7S units. 3. By engaging in this conduct, Defendant violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)] and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act  [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1)].  Unless enjoined, Defendant is reasonably likely to continue to violate the federal securities laws. 4. The Commission also seeks disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest thereon; an order directing the Defendant to pay civil money penalties; and any other relief that may be necessary and appropriate. DEFENDANT  5. Lewis, age 48, resides in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Lewis is not, and has never been, registered with the Commission, FINRA, or any state securities regulatory authority.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa]. 7.

In connection with the conduct alleged in the Complaint, Defendant, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of Case 0:18-cv-61869-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 2 of 9 3  interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in the interstate commerce, and of the mails. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  A. Unregistered Securities Offerings  9. Between October 2010 and October 2015, Aegis raised a total of approximately $35 million from approximately 250 investors nationwide through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and sales of securities in a continuous series of 15 offerings.  See SEC v. Aegis Oil, LLC, et al., Civil Action No. 16-cv-62335-BB (S.D. Fla., Sept. 29, 2016).   10. Between November 2014 and July 2016, 7S, which previously served as the field operator for the Aegis projects, began offering and selling its own investments in oil well projects to the public.  During this period, 7S raised approximately $7 million from at least 70 investors through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and sales of securities in a continuous series of 8 offerings.  See SEC v. 7S Oil & Gas, LLC, et al., Civil Action No. 17-cv-22914-UU (S.D. Fla., Aug. 1, 2017). 11. The securities sold in all offerings were investment contracts in the form of .  Aegis and 7S offered and sold their securities to the public primarily through a network of sales agents, who would cold-call potential investors throughout the country using lead lists.  Aegis generally paid its sales 7S paid its agents commissions ranging from 20% to 35%, also out of investor money.  Neither Aegis nor 7S disclosed to investors the payment of commissions higher than 10%. 12. Sales agents pitched the Aegis and 7S securities to potential investors based on promises of exaggerated rates of return, while minimizing the risks associated with the Case 0:18-cv-61869-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 3 of 9 4  investment.  For example, some of the agents told investors that they would receive returns on their investment, ranging from 15% to 200% on the Aegis units and 20% to 30% on the 7S units.  Some investors were also told by agents that these investments had virtually no risk because, among other things, the projects were already up and running and the wells were located in areas that have produced millions of barrels of oil.  13. After the initial phone contact with potential investors, sales agents would s would a private placement memorandum (PPM) could be mailed out to the investor.  The agents in access certain password-protected parts of the website, including access to the PPMs.  The PPMs for both offerings contained standard boilerplate cautionary language about the investment and misstatements and omissions that were made to investors.  B.   14. Between September 2013 and July 2016, Lewis worked at different times both for Aegis and 7S.  Lewis was recruited by  because of his knowledge of oil wells and previous experience working in the oil and gas industry.    15. Lewis was hired to train the  network of outside sales agents, which entailed traveling to the various sales offices to provide training on the Aegis oil wells.  Lewis also acted as the liaison between the sales agents and the field operator for the various oil well projects so sales agents could get the information they needed when speaking to investors.   Case 0:18-cv-61869-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 4 of 9 5   16. Lewis assisted other agents in closing on sales calls with investors by answering any questions the investors had about the oil well projects, and Lewis also gave investors guided tours of the various Aegis oil wells projects.   17. For his work while at Aegis, Lewis was paid a commission of 2% on all investor proceeds raised through the Aegis offerings  sales agents.   18. Lewis also directly solicited at least one investor, who purchased multiple units in the various Aegis offerings.  Lewis received commissions ranging from 20% to 25% from the proceeds of each of the investments made by this investor.   19. Between September 2013 and November 2014, Lewis was paid commissions of approximately $374,000 from Aegis.   20. After leaving Aegis in approximately December 2014, Lewis was hired by 7S to helping train sales agents.  Lewis also assisted with investor sales calls by answering questions and providing information about the 7S oil wells.   21. Lewis received a 2% commission from 7S on all investor proceeds raised.  He was also paid a 31% commission for selling a unit in one of the 7S offerings to the same investor he had sold the Aegis units.  Between January 2015 and July 2016, Lewis, through his company, Dreamcatcher, LLC, received approximately $250,700 in commission payments from 7S.

Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon, with and through their company, SeeThruEquity,LLC (""STE""), defrauded investors and prospective investors by purporting to provide unbiasedresearch reports on certain publicly-traded small and microcap companies. Defendantsrepresented that STE's reports were ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for,"" that the price targets includedin them were objectively determined, that Defendants did not own the stocks being covered, andthat Defendants took precautions to maintain STE's objectivity. Contrary to those claims,Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 1 of 25 Defendants were compensated handsomely by the covered companies for the research reportsthey published. In addition, Defendants inflated price targets for the companies for which theypublished research reports and made other false statements and omissions, repeatedly violatingboth the anti-fraud and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.2. In addition, Ajay Tandon violated the anti-fraud provisions by investing in STE-covered companies and selling his holdings in the immediate aftermath of favorable STEresearch reports, reaping profits from that illegal pattern of trading.JURISDICTION AND VENUE3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(d)(1) and22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d)(1) and 77v(a)] andSections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [ 15U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].4. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means andinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails or of the facilities of a national securitiesexchange, in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein, certain ofwhich occurred within the Southern District of New York.5. Venue in this district is proper under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because defendantstransact business in this district and certain of the acts, practices, transactions and courses ofbusiness constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within the Southern District of NewYork.2Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 2 of 25 THE DEFENDANTS6. SeeThruEquity, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that was co-founded in 2011 by brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon. STE purports to be a stockresearch company that primarily covers small and microcap issuers. In addition to publishingstock research reports, which it has done since its inception in 2011, STE also periodically hostsinvestor conferences, which it has done approximately twenty-five times since June 2012.7. Aiay Tandon, 41, is a resident of New York, New York. He is the co-founderand CEO of defendant STE. He has experience in the securities industry, having held Series 7and 63 licenses (general securities representative) as well as a Series 241icense (generalsecurities principal).8. Amit Tandon, 47, is a resident of New York, New York. He is the co-founderand Director of Research of defendant STE. He is an attorney and a member of the New YorkBar.FACTSBackground of SeeThruEquity, LLC9. Unless another time is specified, each of the allegations in this Complaint refers tothe period November 9, 2013 to present.10. STE purports to be an equity research company focused on smaller emerginggrowth companies.11. Headquartered in New York City (Manhattan) at all times described herein, STEpublishes research reports on the companies that it covers.3Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 3 of 25 12. STE posts those research reports (including all reports referred to herein) on itswebsite (www.seethruequity.com), distributes them to an opt-in email distribution list estimatedto include 20,000 investors, transmits them for further distribution to aggregators of equityresearch reports such as Thomson First Call, makes them available via links to its website onother social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, and, often, announces and links tothem through press releases.13. Brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon co-founded STE in 2011.14. Amit Tandon filed the formation documents for STE, creating the company as aDelaware single member limited liability company.15. Ajay Tandon is the sole member of STE and its Chief Executive Officer.16. Amit Tandon is STE's Director of Research.17. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon had log-in credentials for STE's website andsocial media accounts.18. Ajay Tandon and, from approximately early 2016, Amit Tandon, had signatoryauthority over STE's primary bank account.19. Both Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon drew regular salaries from STE.Research Reports on Companies in STE's Coverage Universe20. Defendants refer to the collection of companies for which STE has issuedresearch reports as STE's ""coverage universe.""21. As of the date of this complaint, STE's coverage universe consists of at least 240companies.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 4 of 25 22. An STE ""initiation report"" is STE's first research report on a company. Suchreports typically are 15 to 20 pages long.23. An STE '`update report'"" is a research report on a company for which STE haspreviously published an initiation report. Such reports typically are three to five pages long.24. Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon divided roughly evenly the responsibilities ofSTE's research business, including responsibility for overseeing the completion of STE researchreports.25. In general, the Tandon brother responsible for any specific report is listed as a""contact person"" in the specific report.26. The report preparation process began with Ainit Tandon or Ajay Tandon giving toan analyst, retained as an STE contractor, an assignment to prepare a research report.27. STE compensated its contract analysts on a per report basis, typically at a rate of$1,000 per report.28. Having received an assignment, STE's contract analysts input relevant financialdata into a spreadsheet quantitative model (""the STE Model"" or ""Model"")) designed to perform aquantitative analysis and produce certain outputs, including a purportedly objective ""price target""for the company's stock.29. Each STE research report listed the price target next to a recent historical price ofthe stock.30. For example, the October 5, 2017 STE initiation report published on issuerCemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), includes the following:Price Target: $6.45Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 5 of 25 Recent Share Price: $2.8431. Investors and prospective investors who read that report therefore wouldreasonably conclude that STE's purportedly objective analysis revealed a potential for priceappreciation in CETX stock of more than double the current trading price.32. Every single purportedly objective price target that STE has ever published hasbeen higher than the stock in question's then-current trading price.33. STE's contract analysts used the product of the STE Model to prepare a draft ofthe research report, which they then forwarded either to Amit Tandon or Ajay Tandon,depending on which of the Tandons had given them the assignment.34. Working from the draft, Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon finalized, published, anddistributed the research reports.35. As more fully set forth below, in connection with the creation and publication ofSTE research reports and related communications, Defendants made misrepresentations andomissions relating to, among other things: (1) the supposed ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" natureof STE's research, (2) Ajay Tandon's ownership of stocks in the STE coverage universe, (3) theobjectivity of STE's published price targets, (4) the existence of ""customary internal tradingrestrictions,"" and (5) the scalping of STE covered-stocks.Misrepresentations and Omissions RegardingSupposedly ""Unbiased"" and ""Not Paid For"" Research36. All of the research reports issued by Defendants from November 9, 2013 throughat least March 30, 2018, made the representation, or some variation thereof, that ""SeeThruEquityCase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 6 of 25 has not been compensated for the preparation of this report by any third party or the companycovered in the report.""37. STE also represented on its website, on which it posted all STE research reports,and in press releases that often accompanied newly issued STE research reports, that its researchwas ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for.""38. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon knew when they finalized and issued thereports for which they were responsible that these representations in STE's reports and pressreleases and on STE's website were false and that STE had, in fact, been compensated for eachreport to the tune of several thousand dollars in each instance.39. In addition, Ajay Tandon, as STE's CEO and the person with ultimate authorityover the content of STE's research reports, provided substantial assistance to STE by approvingfor publication STE's reports, all of which omitted any disclosure regarding the compensationreceived for those reports.40. To obscure the compensation they received for preparing and disseminatingresearch reports, Defendants ostensibly invited companies to make a ""presentation"" at aninvestor conference in return for STE providing a ""free"" research report for that company.41. Defendants charged between $4,000 and $7,000 for the company to make apresentation at an STE conference. Defendants then claimed that the STE equity research reportthat STE published thereafter was provided at no charge.42. Defendants held out the research reports as ""not paid for,"" although they receivedthousands of dollars for issuing each research report.7Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 7 of 25 43. On at least one occasion, Ajay Tandon directed a STE research analyst to put aresearch report on hold because a company had ""not paid for the conference.""44. Approximately 233 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 97%, paid STE ostensible conference presentation fees, andfour other companies paid STE for supposed ""distribution"" or ""press release"" services relating toSTE's research. Put another way, 237 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 98%, paid STE.45. STE received at least $500,000 from companies in its coverage universe, fromJanuary 1, 2014 to the present.46. In at least one instance, Defendants did not even bother to hide behind theirconference model.47. Specifically, in September 2017, Cemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) explicitlyagreed to pay STE $14,500, in exchange for STE providing Cemtrex 18 months of researchcoverage, including one initiation report and five quarterly update reports, with press releases toaccompany each report.48. Defendant Ajay Tandon negotiated this arrangement with CETX49. Yet the press release announcing the publication of the CETX initiation reportincluded the following:SeeThruEquity has pioneered an innovative business model forequity research that is not paid for and is unbiased. (emphasisadded).50. None of the Defendants' research reports for CETX disclosed this compensation.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 8 of 25 51. Beginning in or about August 2016, STE began stating in its ""Disclosures"" that it""may"" receive compensation from the companies featured in its report for ""non-report-relatedservices,"" including presenting at STE conferences. At no time, however, did any of theDefendants tell investors and prospective investors that STE was in fact receiving compensationfrom the covered companies.Defendants' Research Reports for Quadrant 4 Systems Corp.Misrepresent Compensation and Ownership of a Covered Stock52. In connection with its coverage of Quadrant 4 Systems Corp. (OTCMKTS:QFOR), Defendants concocted an elaborate scheme to conceal STE's receipt of compensationfrom that issuer and ownership of the issuer's shares, structuring the payment of QFOR sharesthrough athird-party nominee.53. Ajay Tandon was primarily responsible for the QFOR initiation report (issued inDecember 2012), and update report (issued in December 2013).54. Approximately one month prior to the publication of the initiation report, QFORissued a QFOR stock certificate for 10,000 shares of restricted stock to a Rajinder Bither(""Bither"").55. Bither is Ajay and Amit Tandon's uncle.56. Bither has never lived in the United States. He lives in India.57. Rather than mail the stock certificate to Bither in India, however, Ajay Tandondirected the issuer (or its transfer agent) to mail the stock certificate to STE's Manhattan office.58. Bither has never done any work for QFOR or STE, but the 10,000 shares ofQFOR issued to Bither were allegedly compensation for consulting work he did for QFOR.ECase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 9 of 25 59. The only evidence of that consulting work is a ""consulting agreement"" purportingto be between Bither and QFOR.60. As originally drafted, the consulting agreement was between QFOR and STE, notBither.61. There are handwritten edits on the consulting agreement by which someonecrossed out STE's name and inserted Bither's.62. The consulting agreement was edited to hide the fact that Ajay Tandon owned10,000 shares of QFOR, received as payment for a favorable STE research report.63. In December 2012, STE published its initiation report on QFOR.64. STE's price target for QFOR in the initiation report was $.59, more than fourtimes the then-current trading price of $.14.65. The December 2012 QFOR initiation report falsely claimed that neither STE norits principals owned shares of QFOR.66. In December 2013, STE published its QFOR update report.67. That December 2013 report falsely claimed that neither STE nor its principalsowned shares of QFOR.68. Ajay Tandon and STE still had the 10,000 certificated shares (issued to Bither) intheir possession on the day the update report was published in December 2013.69. Ajay Tandon considered those shares his, and he knew that the insertion of Bitherinto the scenario was designed to hide his ownership of these shares.70. In fact, on December 4, 2013, five days prior to the publication of the updatereport, Ajay Tandon wrote a letter to the QFOR transfer agent requesting the removal of the10Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 10 of 25 restrictive legend from the 10,000 shares and further asking that the shares be reissued,unrestricted, in his (Ajay Tandon's) name.71. An unrestricted QFOR share certificate was in fact issued in Ajay Tandon's nameon December 9, 2013, the same day that STE published the QFOR update report.72. By using his uncle's name on the QFOR consulting agreement and as the initialpurported holder of QFOR stock, Ajay Tandon hid the fact that STE was not the ""unbiased""equity research company that the Tandons represented it to be.73. Moreover, QFOR is not the only stock about which Ajay Tandon hasmisrepresented share ownership.74. In 2014 and 2015, Ajay Tandon gave multiple interviews to an online publicationcalled the Life Sciences Report.75. In each of his interviews he affirmatively disclaimed both stock ownership andany financial interest in the issuers discussed.76. However, at the time he was interviewed, Ajay Tandon owned stock in at leasttwo of the issuers discussed during the interviews, and nearly all of the issuers discussed hadpaid to present at STE conferences.Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Objectivity of STE Price Targets77. As mentioned above (paragraphs 26 through 34), Defendants contracted withanalysts to perform purportedly objective quantitative modeling in order to project future pricesof equity securities of STE-covered issuers.78. The Defendants used the STE Model from the inception of STE in 2011 topresent.11Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 11 of 25 79. The STE Model required an STE analyst to input certain data about the issuer, atwhich point the Model would produce a figure called a ""price target,"" representing the Model'sprojection of what a share of the issuer's stock would be worth in the future.80. STE often issued press releases in conjunction with publication of its researchreports and often highlighted the ""price target"" in such releases.81. Although the STE Model through which STE performed analysis of issuersyielded a supposedly objective price target, 100% of STE's published price targets were inexcess of the then-current trading price.82. Moreover, STE often published a different, higher, price target, going well abovethe Model's initial results.83. Having paid STE thousands of dollars, issuers expected to, and often did, receiveinput into the substance of STE's supposedly unbiased research reports, including the pricetarget.84. Again, for all 233 companies in STE's coverage universe as of March 31, 2018 onwhich STE had issued a price target, every single price target was higher than the subject stock'scurrent trading price.85. Moreover, the average STE price target was more than 300% higher than thecurrent trading price.86. Both Ajay and Amit Tandon periodically instructed STE analysts to increase theprice targets generated by the STE Model.87. On the instruction of the Tandons, STE analysts increased the price targets abovethe targets generated by the STE Model.12Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 12 of 25 88. On occasion, the Tandons instructed their analysts to make the price target acertain specific figure, or within a specific range, even before the financial modeling had beencompleted.89. By way of specific example for a report created by Amit Tandon, in March 2017,in connection with the preparation of a research report on a company with the ticker symbolFTNW, Amit Tandon instructed the analyst preparing the draft (""Analyst 1 ""), ""Let's try and do$2.75 on the PT.""90. Analyst 1 complied, and Amit Tandon approved the report for release on March21, 2017, with a price target of $2.75.91. The FTNW report does not disclose that Amit Tandon dictated the price target forFTNW.92. On other occasions the Tandons directed STE analysts to increase the price targetsafter issuers Šwho were provided an initial draft of the report before publication Šcomplainedthat the price target should be higher.93. The Defendants failed to disclose in STE reports that price targets were increasedin order to better satisfy the issuers.94. Such information would have been important to a reasonable investor.95. The above-mentioned QFOR update report issued in December 2013 (seeparagraphs 52 through 73) provides another example of undisclosed influence (this time of AjayTandon) on STE's supposedly unbiased price targets.96. In December 2013, QFOR was trading at $1.14.13Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 13 of 25 97. In or about November 2013, an STE analyst (""Analyst 2"") was assigned toprepare a draft of the QFOR update report.98. Analyst 2 input the relevant data into the STE quantitative model, at which pointthe model produced a price target of $1.78, 56 percent above the then-current price ($1.14).99. On December 6, 2013, Analyst 2 sent Ajay Tandon the draft QFOR update reportshowing the price target of $1.78.100. On the morning of December 9, the date of publication, Ajay Tandon respondedto Analyst 2, stating, ""let's push it north of $2,"" referring to the price target.101. Analyst 2 responded, ""I can make it any #, but I had to stretch it very much just toget to these #s.""102. Ajay Tandon responded that he nevertheless wanted to push the price target""above $2, because it is a stock `hurdle' if you get my meaning.""103. Analyst 2 responded, ""[u]nderstood, just wanted to let you know this one is a realstretch,"" and Ajay Tandon stated, ""[fair enough."" Analyst 2 then adjusted the price target to$2.26 in a 10:47 AM draft of the report.104. Around noon on December 9, Ajay Tandon sent the draft update report, with the$2.26 price target, to QFOR's CEO.105. QFOR's CEO expressed displeasure with the price target.106. In reaction to that displeasure, Ajay Tandon instructed Analyst 2 to raise the pricetarget further.14Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 14 of 25 107. By 3:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised STE'sprice target to $3.16, at which point Ajay Tandon told Analyst 2 that he still wanted it raised""considerably.""108. By 4:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised theprice target to $5.25Šmore than double the ""real stretch"" price target of earlier in the day.109. Thereafter, also on December 9, 2013, Ajay Tandon finalized and publishedSTE's update report on QFOR by, among other things, posting it on the STE website,distributing it to the STE opt-in email distribution list, transmitting it to Thomson First Call, FactSet, and Capital IQ, and issuing a press release.110. That press release said, among other things:SeeThruEquity, LLC, a New York City based firm focused onproviding unbiased and institutional equity research ... issued acompany update report on ... QFOR.SeeThruEquity is an approved equity research contributor onThomson One Analytics (First Call).[STE] research is unbiased and not paid for research.111. In truth, the research report was both paid for and biased.112. No investor reading the report or the press release could know that the price targetreflected in the published QFOR report was nearly 300 percent higher than the price targetproduced by STE's supposedly objective quantitative analysis, nor that Ajay Tandon had orderedthe price target increased dramatically to better please the issuer.113. Both the facts misrepresented and the facts omitted would have been important toa reasonable investor.15Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 15 of 25 Misrepresentations Concerning Nonexistent ""Customary Trading Restrictions""114. In or about August 2016, STE began adding language to the ""Disclosures"" portionof each STE research report, including initiation and update reports, stating that STE ""followscustomary internal trading restrictions pending the release of its reports.""115. That representation was false each time the Defendants made it, and it furtheredthe false impression that STE reports were not colored by the Tandons' financial interests.116. At no time did STE have any formal or informal trading restrictions, and theTandons observed no such restrictions.117. In fact, on at least one occasion described in more detail below, Ajay Tandonengaged in scalping of an STE-covered stock despite STE representing that it ""follow[ed]customary internal trading restrictions pending release of its report.""118. Specifically, on October 24, 2016, Ajay Tandon scalped an STE-covered stock(MassRoots, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MSRT)) on the same day that STE published a research report onthe issuer that contained the misrepresentation about `'customary internal trading restrictions.''Ajay Tandon Scalped Covered Stocks119. Making a stock recommendation and then contemporaneously trading against thatrecommendation without adequate disclosure of that trading is a form of securities fraud knownas ""scalping.""120. Ajay Tandon engaged in multiple instances of scalping between 2014 and thepresent.121. A representative example of Ajay Tandon's scalping occurred in 2014. In mid-January 2014, the issuer Medient Studios, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MDNT) was introduced to STE.16Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 16 of 25 122. By January 27, 2014, MDNT had agreed to pay STE several thousand dollars forresearch.123. On March 17, 2014, Ajay Tandon purchased $12,700 of MDNT stock-850,000shares, at an average share price of approximately $.015.124. The next dayŠMarch 18, 2014STE published its initiation report on MDNT,with a price target of $.13, more than eight tunes the price Ajay Tandon paid for his shares theday prior.125. Also on March 18, MDNT's stock price nearly doubledŠfrom approximately$.O1 to $.02Šand Ajay 'I'andon sold all 850,000 shares, for cone-day profit of approximately$6,500.126. The MDNT report's ""Disclosures"" stated only that ""SeeThru and/or its affiliatesmay have a long or short position with respect to the publicly traded shares of the subjectcompany covered in this report.''127. The report did not disclose that Ajay Tandon in fact owned MDNT shares or thathe was planning to sell them on the date of publication.128. Ajay Tandon engaged in similar scalping activityŠselling STE-covered stocksfor prices less than STE's price targets, within one to two days of STE publishing research on theissuers, and without disclosure in at least ten other issuers (including MSRT, as mentionedabove).129. Ajay Tandon generated approximately $20,000 in profits from those trades.130. The chart below includes the specifics of Ajay Tandon's repeated scalps of STE-covered stocks.17Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 17 of 25 TickerSeeThruReportDateAiay SaleDateTimeBetweenReportand AiaySalePriceTarget (PT) atTime ofScalpAiavSalePriceDifferenceAiayProfitBetweenAjay SalePrice andPTMDNT3/18/20143/18/2014Same day$0.13$0.02-$0.11$6,530.00OHGI5/13/20155/13/2015Same day$4.05$2.00-$2.05$4,892.10MHTX6/26/20146/27/2014One day$025$0.18-$0.07$2,652.50IGC5/6/20145/6/2014Same day$3.05$0.80-$2.25$1,783.92IGC4/21/20144/22/2014One day$3.05$0.84-$2.21$1,247.70MSRT10/24/201610/24/2016Same day$2.40$0.82-$1.58$1,201.50TPIV7/1/20147/1/2014Same day$6.97$1.95-$5.02$1,063.37NETE9/22/20149/23/2014One day$5.17$2.80-$2.37$406.50NNVC3/27/20143/27/2014Same day$7.21$3.65-$3.56$94.95BVAP6/18/20156/19/2015One day$0.35$0.09-$0.26$0.00HOTR1/20/20151/20/2015Same day$5.00$1.78-$3.22$0.00OXYS5/11/20155/13/2015Two days$2.30$0.70-$1.60$0.00131.

By reason of the","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a stock research firm and its co-founders with defrauding investors by issuing reports purportedly based on ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" research when in reality they received thousands of dollars from issuers as a condition to providing each report.According to the SEC's complaint, SeeThruEquity LLC and brothers Ajay and Amit Tandon camouflaged the payments by inviting companies to make a ""presentation"" at an investor conference in order to receive a research report for free.  SeeThru and the Tandons allegedly collected up to several thousand dollars in conference presentation fees per company, and the issuers regularly had input into the substance of the supposedly unbiased research reports, even including the price targets at times. The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru's reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock.The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.  According to the SEC's complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure.""There is a clear line between paid advertising and unbiased research coverage, and we allege that SeeThru and its co-founders crossed it to deceive investors and make money,"" said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office.  ""According to our complaint, Ajay Tandon even scalped multiple issuers, further revealing the biased nature of SeeThru's research reports.""The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Ajay and SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Amit with aiding and abetting those violations. It also charges SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; charges Ajay with violating the antifraud and antitouting provisions of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act; charges Amit with violating the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; and charges Ajay with aiding and abetting certain of SeeThru's antifraud and antitouting violations.

In addition, venue is proper in this district because defendant Charles Schwab COMPLAINT 1                                                                                        12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 2 of 11 & Co., Inc. (ﬁSchwabﬂ) is domiciled in this district. SUMMARY 3. In 2012 and 2013, Schwab violated Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-8 by failing to file Suspicious Activity Reports (ﬁSARsﬂ) on suspicious transactions by independent investment advisers (ﬁAdvisersﬂ) that Schwab terminated from its custodial platform. Schwab terminated the Advisers for engaging in activity Schwab determined violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers. 4. Schwab™s failure to file the SARs at issue resulted from its inconsistent implementation of policies and procedures for identifying and reporting suspicious transactions under the SAR Rule (31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)).  Although Schwab investigated and terminated the Advisers, it did not have clear or consistent policies and procedures regarding the types of transactions on which SARs needed to be filed.  For example, Schwab did not file SARs in certain instances where it investigated and terminated Advisers for conduct that led, or reasonably should have led, Schwab to suspect that the Advisers had charged certain customers excessive advisory fees, had allowed their state registrations to lapse, or were engaged in schemes involving ﬁcherry-pickingﬂ (a fraudulent trade allocation scheme where the Adviser allocates profitable trades to the Adviser™s personal account and unprofitable trades to client accounts).  In addition, in a number of instances where Schwab investigated and terminated Advisers for conduct that led, or reasonably should have led, it to suspect that the Advisers misappropriated or misused client funds, Schwab applied an unreasonably high standard for determining whether to file a SAR on the suspicious transactions. THE DEFENDANT 5. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (ﬁSchwabﬂ), headquartered in San Francisco, California, is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer, investment adviser, and transfer agent.  It is a subsidiary of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a publicly traded COMPLAINT 2                                                                          12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 3 of 11 company whose stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. THE ALLEGATIONS A. Schwab™s Investment Adviser Business and Terminations of Advisers 6. Schwab, through its Advisor Services division, offers a broad range of products and services to Advisers and their clients. These Advisers are not employees of Schwab nor are they affiliated with the firm. They are independent third-party advisers who have a separate fiduciary relationship with their clients, and contract with Schwab for custodial and execution services. Investment advisers are persons or firms that are engaged in the business of providing investment advice to others for compensation.  Investment advisers have to register with either the SEC or the state securities agency where they have their principal place of business, depending on the amount of client assets they manage. 7. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, investment advisers have a broad fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their clients.  As fiduciaries, investment advisers must avoid conflicts of interest with their clients and are prohibited from overreaching or taking unfair advantage of their clients™ trust.  Among the obligations that flow from the investment advisers™ fiduciary duty include:  full and fair disclosure of all facts material to the clients™ engagement of the investment adviser and a duty to avoid misleading clients; the disclosure of all material facts regarding any actual or potential conflict of interest between the investment adviser and the client; and an obligation to provide only investment advice that is suitable for the client in light of the client™s financial situation, investment experience, and investment objectives. 8. In 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated its business relationship with 83 Advisers that Schwab determined had violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers.  The terminated Advisers had a combined total of $1.62 billion in assets under management (ﬁAUMﬂ) and almost 18,000 subaccounts at COMPLAINT 3                                                                                           12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 4 of 11 Schwab. B. Schwab™s Failure to File SARs on the Suspicious Transactions of Terminated Advisers 9. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (the ﬁBSAﬂ) (31 U.S.C. §§ 5311-5330) and the SAR Rule (31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)), Schwab is required to file SARs with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (ﬁFinCENﬂ) to report any transaction conducted or attempted by, at, or through Schwab that involved or aggregated funds of at least $5,000 and that Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part): a. involved funds derived from illegal activity; b. was designed to evade any requirements of the BSA or any regulations under the BSA; c. had no business or apparent lawful purpose or was not the sort in which the particular customer would have normally been expected to engage, and Schwab knew of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction; or d. involved the use of Schwab to facilitate criminal activity. 10. Under Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-8, Schwab is required to comply with the recordkeeping, retention, and reporting obligations of the BSA and its implementing regulations, including the SAR Rule.  Schwab™s failure to file a SAR is a violation of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 17a-8. 11. At least 47 of the 83 terminated Advisers engaged in transactions of at least $5,000 that were conducted at, by, or through Schwab and that Schwab, knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect were suspicious under the SAR Rule.  Schwab, however, filed SARs relating to the suspicious transactions of only 10 of the terminated Advisers, and three of those SARs were filed after the SEC had brought an enforcement action against the Adviser. COMPLAINT 4                                                                                                12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 5 of 11 12. Schwab failed to file SARs relating to the suspicious transactions of the remaining 37 terminated Advisers.  These 37 terminated Advisers were registered, or should have been registered, as investment advisers with either the SEC or a state securities agencies and combined had a total of over $840 million in AUM and at least 6,500 subaccounts at Schwab. 13. Schwab™s failure to file the SARs at issue resulted from its inconsistent implementation of policies and procedures for identifying and reporting transactions under the SAR Rule. Schwab had a SAR policy that stated that it should file a SAR on any transaction of $5,000 or more that ﬁinvolves potential fraud.ﬂ  The policy further defined ﬁSecurities Fraudﬂ as a ﬁwide range of crimes whereby securities [were] used as an instrumentality in a scheme to defraud,ﬂ including ﬁmarket manipulation, making untrue statements in regard to specific securities, attempting to deceive another in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, and attempting to illicitly transact in unregistered or restricted securities.ﬂ 14. Although Schwab did file SARs relating to the apparent theft of client funds by Advisers, Schwab failed to file SARs relating to other types of potentially illegal or fraudulent transactions by Advisers it terminated.  For example, in various instances, Schwab failed to file SARs relating to transactions by Advisers that it suspected, or reasonably should have suspected, involved:  (1) an Adviser™s possible self-dealing or conflict of interest through the suspicious transfer of funds from client accounts custodied at Schwab to accounts or investments affiliated with the Adviser; (2)the Adviser™s use of Schwab™s management fee system to charge client accounts excessive advisory fees; (3) patterns of potentially fraudulent transactions in client accounts such as ﬁcherry-pickingﬂ; (4) Advisers who Schwab suspected were logging-in or signing in the name of clients to effect or confirm transactions in client accounts; and (5) Advisers who had allowed their registrations to lapse but continued to execute client trades and/or collect advisory fees through Schwab. 15. In addition, Schwab applied an unreasonably high standard for COMPLAINT 5                                                                                                             12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 6 of 11 determining whether to file a SAR on transactions it suspected or should have suspected involved possible misappropriation or other misuse of client funds.  As alleged in paragraphs 18 and 19 below, for example, Schwab did not file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the Adviser had misused client funds but the clients had not complained to Schwab about the transactions. 16. As a result of Schwab™s failure to file the required SARs at issue, the SEC and other regulatory or law enforcement agencies were not alerted to the Advisers™ suspicious transactions as required. C. Examples of Schwab™s Failure to File SARs on the Suspicious Transactions of Terminated Advisers 17. The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved the suspicious transfer of funds from client accounts custodied at Schwab to accounts or investments affiliated with the Adviser. 18. For example, ﬁAdviser Aﬂ was a State-registered Adviser with $14 million in AUM and 244 subaccounts at Schwab. In late 2013, Schwab learned that Adviser A had caused two clients to wire transfer a total of $295,000 from their Schwab accounts to an account controlled by Adviser A. Schwab also learned that shortly after the client funds were wired to Adviser A, Adviser A purchased a personal residence for himself. The clients confirmed to Schwab that they were aware of the wire transfers but could not say what the wire transfers were for. Adviser A told Schwab that he invested the clients in a private residential real estate investment trust but did not provide to Schwab the documents for the purported investment. Schwab then terminated Adviser A. 19. Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the $295,000 in wire transfers were suspicious under the SAR Rule and should have filed a SAR on them. Schwab, however, did not file the required SAR. The memorandum closing Schwab™s investigation regarding Adviser A stated, in part, that ﬁ[i]t is possible that [Adviser A] used the client™s funds for the purchase of his property but this fact can not be confirmed.  The wire transfers by the two clients were COMPLAINT 6                                                                                     12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 7 of 11 researched.  Both clients were found to have verified and authorized the wire transfers on recorded lines.  This matter is being closed as nothing [was] found since neither client has complained or disputed the wire transfers [Adviser A].ﬂ Given the information known to Schwab and Schwab™s termination of Adviser A based on that information, the standards requiring a SAR filing were met, and Schwab applied too high a standard by requiring that the misuse be ﬁconfirmedﬂ or that the clients complain. 20. As another example, ﬁAdviser Bﬂ was an SEC-registered Adviser with $92 million in AUM and 543 subaccounts at Schwab.  In 2013, Schwab terminated Adviser B after learning that three of its clients had each invested $100,000 in a private placement of securities by Adviser B™s disclosed parent company.  Schwab found that the principal of both Adviser B and its parent company was apparently in poor financial condition because he had an outstanding federal tax lien and a recent $2 million civil judgment against him relating to selling investment contracts in life insurance policies. 21. Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the $300,000 in investments were suspicious under the SAR Rule. Schwab therefore should have filed a SAR on the transactions.  Schwab, however, did not file the required SAR on the suspicious transactions. 22. The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved Advisers using Schwab™s management fee system to charge client Schwab accounts suspicious advisory fees. Schwab, however, failed to file a SAR relating to the terminated Advisers™ suspicious fees because Schwab unreasonably believed that such transactions did not warrant SARs. 23. For example, ﬁAdviser Cﬂ was a State-registered Adviser with $6.7 million in AUM and 150 subaccounts at Schwab.  Schwab terminated Adviser C for using Schwab™s management fee system to charge a client a suspicious $28,000 fee, which was up ﬁdramaticallyﬂ from previous quarterly fees of about $2,000.  Schwab COMPLAINT 7                                                                                         12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 8 of 11 could not verify the fee based on the documentation provided by Adviser C. 24. Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that Adviser C had misappropriated funds from the client through charging her an improper fee and that the fee was suspicious under the SAR Rule.  Schwab therefore should have filed a SAR on the transaction.  Schwab, however, did not file the required SAR on the suspicious fee because it unreasonably believed that such fees did not warrant SAR filings. 25. The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved transactions in client accounts that were part of suspected ﬁcherry-pickingﬂ schemes to defraud their clients.  Schwab did not file SARs on the suspicious transactions of these Advisers because it unreasonably believed that such conduct did not require a SAR filing. 26. For example, ﬁAdviser Dﬂ was an SEC-registered Adviser with $50 million in AUM and 476 subaccounts at Schwab.  Schwab found that in 2009 and 2010, Adviser D appeared to allocate 17 profitable day trades for itself for profits totaling about $75,000.  Schwab twice counseled Adviser D about the suspicious trading, including telling Adviser D that such apparent preferential trade allocation ﬁshould be of concern to [Adviser D] in the case of any audit conducted by the SEC or other regulatory agencies.ﬂ Schwab terminated Adviser D in 2012. 27. Based on that information, from as early as 2009, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that Adviser D was engaging in a fraudulent cherry-picking scheme and that the trading was suspicious under the SAR Rule. Schwab therefore should have filed a SAR on the trading.  Schwab, however, did not file the required SAR on the trading because it unreasonably believed that such apparent preferential trade allocations did not warrant a SAR filing. 28. The suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved Advisers whom Schwab suspected of posing as clients to effect or confirm transactions at Schwab. COMPLAINT 8                                                                                              12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 9 of 11 29. For example, ﬁAdviser Eﬂ was a State-registered Adviser with $17 million in AUM and 132 subaccounts at Schwab who did not have discretionary trading authority over its clients™ accounts.  Schwab terminated Adviser E after he admitted to Schwab that he used the username and password of 20 clients to log on to Schwab™s client web portal (rather than following Schwab™s rule that Advisers log onto the Adviser™s web portal using the Adviser™s username and password). Schwab trading records show that trades were made in certain of these client accounts. 30. Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that Adviser E was posing as its clients to place trades.  Schwab therefore knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the transactions were suspicious under the SAR Rule and should have filed a SAR on the transactions.  Schwab, however, did not file the required SAR on Adviser E.  31. Finally, the suspicious transactions by some of the 37 terminated Advisers involved Advisers who were not properly registered as an Adviser but executed client trades and/or collected advisory fees through Schwab™s management fee system. 32. For example, ﬁAdviser Fﬂ was an unregistered Adviser with $3 million in AUM and 78 subaccounts at Schwab.  Schwab terminated Adviser F after finding that Adviser F had not been registered as an Adviser for almost two years but had collected over $100,000 in fees through Schwab™s management fee system. Similarly, ﬁAdviser Gﬂ had $14 million in AUM and 11 subaccounts at Schwab.  When Adviser G™s registration as an Adviser lapsed with the Commission in mid-December 2012, Schwab restricted Adviser G™s ability to charge client fees through Schwab™s management fee system.  Shortly thereafter, Adviser G requested Schwab to send it $40,375 in management fees from a client™s IRA account.  Schwab told Adviser G that it could not use Schwab™s management fee system because it was not registered and that it would have to collect the fees outside of Schwab. 33. Based on that information, Schwab knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect that Adviser F and Adviser G were engaging or attempting to engage in COMPLAINT 9                                                          12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Case 3:18-cv-03942 Document 1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 10 of 11 transactions as unregistered investment advisers and that the transactions or attempted transactions were suspicious under the SAR Rule.  Schwab therefore should have filed a SAR on the transactions. Schwab, however, did not file the required SARs on the suspicious transactions or attempted transactions of unregistered Adviser because it unreasonably believed that such suspicious transactions did not warrant a SAR filing. 34. As a result of this conduct, Schwab violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8.  CLAIM FOR RELIEF Violations of Exchange Act Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 [15 U.S.C. § 78q(a) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.17a-8] 35. The SEC realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 34, as though fully set forth herein. 36.

The SEC's complaint alleges that in 2012 and 2013, Schwab terminated 83 independent investment advisers for engaging in activity that Schwab determined violated its internal policies and presented risk to Schwab or its customers. The complaint further alleges that at least 47 of the terminated advisers engaged in transactions through Schwab that it knew, suspected, or had reason to suspect were suspicious and required the filing of a SAR. Schwab failed to file SARs on the suspicious transactions of 37 of these terminated advisers. Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had engaged in a range of suspicious transactions not involving the outright misappropriation or misuse of client funds, including: (1) transactions involving possible undisclosed self-dealing or conflicts of interest; (2) charging client accounts excessive advisory fees; (3) potentially fraudulent transactions in client accounts; (4) posing as a client to effect or confirms transactions in the client account; and (5) executing client trades and/or collecting advisory fees without being properly registered as an adviser. Moreover, Schwab failed to file SARs where it suspected or had reason to suspect that the terminated adviser had misused client funds but the client had not complained.The SEC's complaint charges Schwab with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Schwab has agreed to settle the action by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, to the entry of a permanent injunction and the payment of a $2.8 million civil penalty."

The Commission brings this action pursuant to its authority under Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77t(b)] and seeks an order: a. finding that the Defendants violated the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws; b. permanently restraining and enjoining Defendants from committing future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; c. prohibiting Greenlaw from participating in any sale or offer to sell any security (other than securities listed on a national securities exchange for his own personal account) in a registered or exempt transaction through the solicitation  or accepting of funds from any person, unless he first provides a Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 2 of 9    PageID #: 2 3  copy of the Commission™s filed complaint in this matter and any judgment that the Commission obtains against Greenlaw in this matter; d. ordering disgorgement and prejudgment interest from Greenlaw; and  e. ordering Greenlaw to pay civil penalties.  II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  5. The Commission seeks injunctions and disgorgement pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77t(b)] and Section 21(d)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. §78u(d)(5)].  The Commission seeks the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77t(d)].   6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)]. 7.  Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77v(a)].  NECS™ principal place of business and Greenlaw™s residence are in Kittery, Maine, which is within this district.  Further, Greenlaw has transacted business involving NECS and each of the Cannabis-Related Entities by offering and selling securities to the public from the district. 8. In connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint, the Defendants have directly and indirectly made use of the means and instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell or to offer to sell the securities of NECS and the Cannabis-Related Entities. III. DEFENDANTS  9. Richard J. Greenlaw, is an individual residing in Kittery, Maine.  Greenlaw has been the founder and managing member of NECS since 2014 and is currently its only full-time Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 3 of 9    PageID #: 3 4  employee.  The Commission filed a prior enforcement action against Greenlaw in 1983 alleging violations of Section 5(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for his role in an investment scheme involving certain risky stocks and options trading.  In November 1983, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire entered an order against Greenlaw in that prior case, to which he consented.  Among other things, the 1983 order included a permanent injunction against violating the above securities law statutes. 10. NECS, is a Maine limited liability company with its principal place of business in Kittery, Maine.  Greenlaw owns or controls approximately 60% of the shares in NECS. 11. Cannabis-Related Entities.  In addition to NECS, Greenlaw formed nineteen other limited liability companies (ﬁLLCsﬂ) for eighteen different states (including, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), as well as New York City.  NECS retains at least a 51% share ownership of each of the state Cannabis-Related Entities.  The additional LLC defendants are as follows:   NYCS LLC, MaineCS LLC, VTCS LLC, MassCS LLC, NHCS LLC, RICS LLC, CTCS LLC, FLCS LLC, ILCS LLC, IACS LLC, LOUCS LLC, MICS LLC, MNCS LLC, NDCS LLC, NJCS LLC, OHCS LLC, PennCS LLC, UPCS LLC, and WICS LLC.  IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  12. NECS is purportedly in the business of selling medical marijuana that does not contain Tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as ﬁTHCﬂ), the chemical compound responsible for most of marijuana™s psychological effects.  Instead, NECS markets Cannabidiol (or ﬁCBDﬂ), a Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 4 of 9    PageID #: 4 5  second compound present in hemp, purportedly as a therapeutic aid for various medical conditions such as pain, nausea, and anxiety, among others. 13. In late 2014, shortly after forming NECS, Greenlaw began promoting investment opportunities in NECS to prospective investors through advertisements on Craigslist, an online-classified advertising website.  Greenlaw described the securities offering as an opportunity to be part of the new medical cannabis industry ﬁwithout getting into marijuana and all of its regulations.ﬂ  During the period December 2014 through May 4, 2018, Greenlaw posted his advertisements in various regional pages on the Craigslist website in order to reach prospective investors in various states throughout the country. 14. Originally, Greenlaw formed LLCs for NECS and separate entities in each of the six New England states.  Greenlaw typically offered prospective investors a 5% share of each LLC for $5,000.  Greenlaw offered prospective investors quarterly profits equal to the percentage of each investor™s ownership interest (for example, 5% of quarterly profits for 5% ownership).  Greenlaw™s valuations of the underlying companies fluctuated, so he offered some prospective investors a 5% interest for as much as $10,000. 15. Greenlaw later expanded to additional states, forming LLCs for Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and two for New York, one upstate and the other for New York City.      16. In response to inquiries from prospective investors who saw the Craigslist advertisements, Greenlaw emailed prospective investors cannabis-related literature describing CBD in further detail, as well as securities offering documents, including LLC documents and subscription agreements (an investment document that contains a promise by a company to sell a Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 5 of 9    PageID #: 5 6  given number of shares to an investor at a certain price and an agreement by the investor to pay that price).  In certain instances, Greenlaw mailed the information to prospective investors. 17. Between December 2014 and April 2018, approximately fifty-nine investors signed subscription agreements with Greenlaw and NECS or the Cannabis-Related Entities, investing a total amount of approximately $500,000.  Greenlaw signed the subscription agreements on behalf of NECS and/or the Cannabis-Related Entities and typically transmitted signed copies of the completed executed subscription agreements to the investors either through email or by U.S. Mail.    18. The securities transactions that are the subject of this complaint were not registered with the Commission. 19. Certain of the Commission™s securities registration rules allow for the sale of unregistered securities if the investors in the securities offering meet the standards for being an ﬁaccredited investor.ﬂ  An investor may have this status if the investor has a certain level of income or net worth.   20. Each of the signed NECS and Cannabis-Related Entities subscription agreements have a box checked reflecting that the investors are accredited investors because they are a director, executive officer, or general partner of the LLC.  Greenlaw either pre-checked this box or asked investors to check it.  However, the investors were not directors, executive officers, or general partners of the relevant LLCs.  Greenlaw understood that many of the investors would be purely passive investors and that they would not be taking any active role in managing or running of the company as a director, executive officer or general partner of the LLC.  As a result, this section of the subscription agreements did not accurately reflect all investors™ qualifications as an ﬁaccredited investor.ﬂ Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 6 of 9    PageID #: 6 7  21. Further, in soliciting investments or otherwise offering for sale unregistered securities, Greenlaw did not otherwise take steps to determine whether the investors were in fact accredited investors.  For example, Greenlaw did not ask prospective investors for financial information.  At least some investors were not accredited investors because they did not meet the income or net worth thresholds for accredited investors. 22. No registration statement is on file with the Commission or in effect with respect to, and no exemption applies to, the transactions alleged in paragraphs 1 through 21. V. CLAIM FOR RELIEF Unregistered Offer and Sale of Securities (Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act) 23. The Commission restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 22 above. 24. Defendants, by engaging in the conduct described above, directly or indirectly made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, to offer to sell or to sell securities, or carried or caused to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by means or instruments of transportation, securities for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale, when no registration statement had been filed or was in effect as to such securities, and when no exemption from registration was applicable. 25. By engaging in the conduct described above, Defendants violated, and unless restrained and enjoined, is reasonably likely to continue to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77e(a) and (c)]. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court: Case 2:18-cv-00321-NT   Document 1   Filed 08/17/18   Page 7 of 9    PageID #: 7 8  A.

D. Order that Greenlaw disgorge all ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment and post-judgment interest, resulting from the violations alleged herein. E. Order Greenlaw to pay civil penalties under Section 20(d) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77t(d). F. Retain jurisdiction of this action in accordance with the principles of equity and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in order to implement and carry out the terms of all orders and decrees that may be entered, or to entertain any suitable application or motion for additional relief within the jurisdiction of this Court.

Greenlaw, of Kittery, Maine, raised approximately $500,000 from at least 59 investors by offering securities in 20 cannabis-related entities that he formed, which purportedly sold medical marijuana products that did not contain THC, the chemical compound responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects. According to the complaint, Greenlaw sold ownership interests in the companies by posting advertisements on Craigslist.

20,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA  CASE NO.   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,   Plaintiff,  v.  ADAM C. WASSERMAN,   Defendant.     COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges: SUMMARY 1. Adam C. Wasserman (ﬁWassermanﬂ), the U.S.-based former chief financial officer (ﬁCFOﬂ) of a public company headquartered in China, improperly commingled corporate and personal funds as part of a practice to transfer funds to the U.S. while avoiding foreign currency controls. 2. Defendant Wasserman served as the outsourced CFO to Issuer A, a NASDAQ-listed microcap company, for several periods since 2007, including from December 2012 to February 2016.  Wasserman provided CFO and accounting services to Issuer A through his business, CFO Oncall, Inc. (ﬁCFO Oncallﬂ).  Beginning in December 2014, Wasserman began a practice of transferring Issuer A funds from China to the U.S. to pay Issuer A™s U.S. expenses using his personal joint checking account.  Over a 20-month period, Wasserman transferred more than $400,000 in corporate funds through his personal bank account.  Wasserman previously engaged in the same practice with at least two other China-based public companies.   Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 1 of 9 2 3. By his actions, Wasserman violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)] and should be enjoined from committing such violations in the future.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(d)(5), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3(A), 78u(d)(5) and 78aa]. 5. Venue is proper in this district under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. Certain of the acts and transactions constituting the alleged violations occurred in the Southern District of Florida.  In addition, during the relevant time period, Wasserman resided in, and CFO Oncall had its principal place of business in, the Southern District of Florida. 6. Wasserman, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. DEFENDANT 7. Adam Wasserman, age 54, lives in Weston, Florida.  He served as Issuer A™s outsourced CFO from November 2007 to February 2008, from March 2008 to December 2008, and from December 2012 to February 2016.  At all other times since November 2007, Wasserman provided outsourced accounting services to Issuer A through his business, CFO Oncall.    Wasserman was issued a license from the New York State Education Department to practice Certified Public Accountancy in November 1988; his license has been inactive since June 1997. Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 2 of 9 3 RELATED ENTITIES 8. Issuer A is a company incorporated in Nevada with its principal place of business in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China.  Issuer A was formed in 2007 through a merger of a public shell and a group of industrial manufacturing companies based in Wuxi, China, under common ownership and control.  During the relevant time period, Issuer A had a market capitalization of less than $15 million and was in the business of manufacturing textile machines and industrial components.  Issuer A™s securities trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market and are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. 9. CFO Oncall is a company incorporated in Florida with its principal place of business in Broward County, Florida.  Wasserman is the principal and majority owner of CFO Oncall. FACTS 10. As a public company, Issuer A  was required to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that, among other things, transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets. 11. As a public company, Issuer A was also required to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of the company™s assets. 12. As CFO of Issuer A, Wasserman was responsible for devising and maintaining Issuer A™s system of internal accounting controls and for ensuring the accuracy of Issuer A™s books and records.  Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 3 of 9 4 A. China Currency Restrictions 13. Upon information and belief, currency restrictions imposed by the Chinese government limit the ability of companies to transfer cash directly from China to a corporate account in the U.S.   B. Management of Issuer A™s U.S. Cash and Expenses 14. For each fiscal year from its formation in 2007 until at least 2016, Issuer A generated most of its revenue in China. 15. During this period, Issuer A incurred a variety of U.S. expenses including audit, legal, and filing fees.  16. Prior to December 2014, Issuer A generated cash within the U.S. to pay its  expenses in at least two different ways.   17. From approximately 2012 to 2013, Issuer A made sales of at least $1.7 million to a U.S.-based customer who paid through wire transfers to Issuer A™s U.S. corporate bank account. 18. Issuer A also raised cash from time to time by issuing securities to U.S. investors.  These investors wired funds to a U.S. escrow account and in turn to Issuer A™s U.S. corporate bank account. C. Wire Transfers from China to the U.S. 19. By late 2014, Issuer A lacked sufficient U.S. cash to pay expenses. 20. To address this problem, Wasserman developed the following practice:  Issuer A personnel wired Issuer A funds into Wasserman™s personal bank account, a joint checking account with his wife.  After subtracting wire fees, Wasserman transferred these funds to Issuer A™s U.S. account under his control. Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 4 of 9 5 21.

On February 24, 2016, Issuer A personnel in China wired $10,000.00 of Issuer A funds from an account in China to Wasserman™s personal account.

Other than deducting wire fees, Wasserman transferred the exact amount of Issuer A™s corporate funds he received into Issuer A™s U.S. account and did not otherwise personally benefit from the transfers. 32. By repeatedly commingling corporate funds with his own personal funds, Wasserman put Issuer A™s assets at risk for misuse and loss, particularly if something were to happen to him while the funds were in his account.  In designing and facilitating these transfers, Case 1:18-cv-23729-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 09/12/2018   Page 7 of 9 8 Wasserman failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls designed to ensure that Issuer A™s assets remained under corporate control.

33,"- 1 - UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION          UNITED STATES SECURITIES   AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,            Case No.     Plaintiff,             v.     HON.          JOHN C. MACCOLL,                 Defendant.       ____________________________________/  COMPLAINT  Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges as follows: SUMMARY OF THE ACTION 1. The Commission brings this civil law enforcement action to address Defendant John C. Maccoll™s (ﬁMaccollﬂ) multi-million-dollar securities fraud.  Between approximately 2008 and March 2018, Maccoll defrauded at least 15 of his retail brokerage customers out of nearly $4 million.  During that time period, Maccoll worked as a registered representative associated with a large, nationwide broker-dealer and investment adviser dually registered with the Commission (ﬁBroker-Dealer Aﬂ). 2. Maccoll lied and used high pressure sales tactics to solicit at least 15 of his customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after, alternative, private fund investment.  Maccoll represented to customers that by investing in the purported fund, they could diversify their portfolios, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and have investment growth potential that was better than on the securities that they held at Broker-Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.1    Page 1 of 10  - 2 - Dealer A.  Maccoll convinced the customers to sell or borrow against their securities at Broker-Dealer A and to transfer nearly $4 million of the proceeds to him to fund the investments.  Maccoll™s statements to his customers were false.  Maccoll did not invest the customers™ money but stole the money for his own personal use.  He spent nearly $3.6 million on personal expenses and paid over $400,000 to certain of his customers in Ponzi-like payments to keep his fraudulent scheme alive.   3. By engaging in this conduct, Maccoll violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.   4. In connection with this lawsuit, the Commission seeks a permanent injunction against Maccoll to enjoin him from future violations of the above-cited provisions of the federal securities laws.  The Commission further seeks an order requiring Maccoll to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of the ill-gotten gains that he received through his fraud, along with the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t] and Section 21 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u]. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa].  Defendant Maccoll, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.2    Page 2 of 10  - 3 - national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa] because certain of the acts, practices and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  In addition, during the relevant time period, Defendant Maccoll resided and conducted business within the Eastern District of Michigan. THE DEFENDANT 7. John C. Maccoll is 65 years old and resides in Rochester Hills, Michigan.  Between January 2006 and his termination on March 15, 2018, Maccoll worked as a registered representative in the Birmingham, Michigan branch office of Broker-Dealer A, a large, nationwide broker-dealer and investment adviser dually registered with the Commission.  Maccoll has worked for registered broker-dealers since July 1977 and during the relevant time period, he held Series 5, 6, 7, 8, 63 and 66 securities licenses. FACTS Maccoll™s Offering Fraud and Misappropriation Scheme  8. Starting in 2008, Defendant Maccoll began soliciting certain of his brokerage customers to invest in a purported private, alternative, hedge-type fund that Maccoll claimed was highly-profitable, exclusive, and outside of Broker-Dealer A™s investment platform.  Between 2008 and March 2018, Defendant Maccoll fraudulently convinced at least 15 customers to sell and/or borrow against securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to him for investment in the purported private Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10  - 4 - investment.  In reality, Maccoll used all of the funds that he raised for his own personal use and to make Ponzi-like payments to certain customers.   9. Most of the customers targeted by Maccoll were elderly, retired, and from working-class or middle-class backgrounds.  Maccoll had long-standing relationships with these customers, who trusted him completely to manage their investments.  10. The customers Maccoll targeted held tax-advantaged retirement accounts at Broker-Dealer A, including IRA accounts, a pension fund conversion, and a federal government Thrift Savings Plan account rollover.  One customer account included the customer™s life savings and money from her deceased husband™s life insurance payout, which she intended to use to pay for college expenses for her three children.  Maccoll knew that the funds invested in his customers™ accounts were intended for their retirement and for college expenses.  11. When touting his fictitious fund investment, Maccoll used the name of a real family of alternative investment funds to cloak his fraudulent securities offering with legitimacy.  Certain customers were aware of and took comfort from the fact that an alternative fund investment in the name used by Maccoll actually existed.   But, in reality, Maccoll had nothing to do with the real, established fund family.   12. Maccoll told some of his customers that an investment in the purported fund  would diversify their portfolios.  13. He also told customers that the purported fund paid returns on investment ranging from 10% to 20% each year and that the potential for investment growth was better than the investments they had made in their accounts with Broker-Dealer A.   Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10  - 5 -  14. Maccoll also told customers that the purported investment fund was exclusive and that he had a unique opportunity to place them in a fund that otherwise would not be open to small, retail investors.   15. Maccoll told customers that that they were privileged to have an opportunity to invest because Maccoll was only offering the opportunity to a limited number of select clients.  16. Maccoll applied pressure by telling customers that they had to act fast because the investment opportunity he offered was only open during short windows of time.  Maccoll told one customer that if she decided not to invest, she would lose the opportunity in the future and he would find someone else. 17. Maccoll told customers that their funds would be ﬁlocked upﬂ and  unavailable for withdrawals for a certain amount of time, and that they only could make additional investments in the fund when it was open for investment.  He also told customers that they should expect little information directly from the fund including a prospectus, trade confirmations, or account statements.   18. In order to hide his fraud from Broker-Dealer A and others, Maccoll instructed his customers not to tell others about the fact that they had invested their funds in the purported fund investment because he could not open the offering to everyone. 19. Maccoll fraudulently convinced his customers to sell securities held in their accounts or to open and draw down on a line of credit within their accounts, using their securities as collateral, in order to finance the investments.  He then instructed his customers to deposit or wire the proceeds from these transactions into their personal bank accounts.  Once the funds were in his customers™ personal bank accounts, Maccoll told the Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10  - 6 - customers to write checks for their investments payable to ﬁMac 011ﬂ or ﬁMac 01.ﬂ  Maccoll picked up the checks from his customers™ homes, added his first name to the payee line, and then deposited the checks into his personal bank account, over which he had sole control.    20. Most of Maccoll™s customers did not ask for account statements or other documentation related to their purported investment and instead, accepted Maccoll™s oral descriptions of the performance of the investment.    21. However, as part of his scheme, Maccoll created and provided some of his customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns in connection with his fraudulent fund offering.    22. Maccoll acted deliberately, with the intent to deceive.  He knew that the investment he described to his customers did not exist, and he never invested any of the money he raised from his customers in the promised investment.    23. As a result of Maccoll™s false and misleading statements, at least 15 customers transferred nearly $4 million to Macoll.   Maccoll™s Misappropriation of Investor Funds  24. Instead of using his customers™ funds as promised, Maccoll misappropriated the nearly $4 million he raised, including at least $3,406,003 between August 2018 and March 2018. In an attempt to keep the scheme alive, Maccoll used approximately $411,529 of the funds to make Ponzi-like payments to at least six of his customers between November 2013 and March 2018.  He used the remaining funds for his personal benefit.    25. By April 2018, Maccoll had less than $7,000 remaining in his bank accounts.  Case 2:18-cv-12473-SFC-DRG   ECF No. 1   filed 08/09/18    PageID.6    Page 6 of 10  - 7 - Maccoll™s Scheme Was Uncovered 26. Maccoll™s scheme began to crumble in the fall of 2017, when one of his customers began asking Maccoll to provide him with documentation and online access for his investment.  In February 2018, after numerous requests, Maccoll finally sent the customer a fax containing a purported account statement for the purported fund investment that contained several obvious errors and misspellings.  This phony account statement caused the customer to have concerns about the legitimacy of the investment, and  to contact Broker-Dealer A and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) to express his concerns.     27. After Broker-Dealer A and FINRA were notified about Maccoll™s likely fraud, they requested to interview him.   However, Maccoll failed to appear and on or about March 10, 2018, Broker-Dealer A received an 11-page letter from Maccoll addressed to ﬁRegulators and FINRAﬂ in which Maccoll confessed to misappropriating funds from his customers.  Broker-Dealer A terminated Maccoll shortly thereafter. COUNT ONE  Violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1), 77q(a)(2) and 77q(a)(3)]   28.

17,"1  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO  Civil Action No. 18-cv-02381  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,  Plaintiff, v.  CLOVIS ONCOLOGY, INC., PATRICK J. MAHAFFY, and ERLE T. MAST  Defendants.   COMPLAINT   Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁSECﬂ or ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint against Clovis Oncology, Inc., Patrick J. Mahaffy, and Erle T. Mast (collectively, the ﬁdefendantsﬂ) alleges as follows: NATURE OF THE ACTION  1. From approximately July 8, 2015 through November 16, 2015 (the ﬁrelevant time periodﬂ), Clovis Oncology, Inc. (ﬁClovisﬂ or the ﬁcompanyﬂ), a biopharmaceutical company based in Boulder, Colorado and listed on NASDAQ, and its current Chief Executive Officer (ﬁCEOﬂ), Patrick Mahaffy (ﬁMahaffyﬂ), negligently made untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements they made not misleading to investors about its then flagship lung cancer drug, rociletinib (ﬁRociﬂ). Clovis™ former Chief Financial Officer (ﬁCFOﬂ), Erle Mast (ﬁMastﬂ), aided and abetted such untrue statements and/or omissions. For investors, Clovis™ value in 2015 was directly tied to the ability of Roci to compete in the market for lung cancer drugs. One important driver of the competition Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 15 2  was Roci™s ﬁefficacyﬂ Œ how well the drug worked Œ and how that efficacy compared to a drug simultaneously under development by another biopharmaceutical company, referred to herein as ﬁDRUG X.ﬂ 2. On May 31, 2015, Clovis disclosed to investors at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ﬁASCOﬂ) conference, that Roci™s efficacy, referred to as Objective Response Rate (ﬁORRﬂ), in ongoing clinical trials was 60% for its 500mg dose, meaning that in 60% of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. That Roci™s efficacy was 60% was material to investors, as investors believed that this efficacy rate was almost identical to DRUG X, which had a disclosed efficacy rate at the time of 63%. Investors therefore valued Clovis stock assuming that Roci would capture meaningful market share. 3. Shortly after the May 31, 2015 disclosure, the data provided to Mahaffy, Mast, and other Clovis senior executives began to show that Roci™s efficacy rate was materially lower than 60%. In mid-June 2015, Clovis™ updated Roci data provided to Mahaffy showed an ORR in the mid-40s. On July 7, 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the Roci data that would be submitted in the initial submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (ﬁFDAﬂ) for Roci™s approval showed an ORR of 42%. 4. While Clovis™ non-public data, which was used to prepare its submission to the FDA, showed an ORR below 60%, Clovis continued citing to the May 2015 ASCO conference and its disclosure that Roci™s ORR was 60%. On July 8, 2015, Clovis referenced the May 2015 ASCO conference and the 60% ORR for Roci in the solicitation materials for a $298 million offering of its securities (the ﬁOfferingﬂ). After the Offering, Clovis continued to repeat the 60% ORR in public disclosures. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 15 3  5. On November 9, 2015, the FDA informed Clovis that it disagreed with Clovis™ calculation of the efficacy results for Roci, that an accurate calculation of Roci™s efficacy put the ORR in the 20s, and that Clovis must provide new calculations to the FDA by November 16, 2015. On November 10, 2015, Clovis attended an investor conference and referenced the May 2015 ASCO conference and the 60% ORR figure, but without disclosing that the FDA had told Clovis it disagreed with Clovis™ efficacy analysis. 6. On November 16, 2015, Clovis disclosed the true ORR, as calculated by the methodology required by the FDA, telling the market that Roci™s ORR was 28%. The stock price collapsed as a result, dropping approximately 70% from $99.43 to $30.24 per share. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  7. The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)-(e) and 78aa]. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint. 8. Venue lies in this judicial district pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 77u(a) and 78aa and 18 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). Defendants Mahaffy and Mast reside in this district, Clovis™ principal place of business is in this district, and violations occurred in this district. DEFENDANTS  9. CLOVIS ONCOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation, is a biopharmaceutical company with its principal place of business in Boulder, Colorado. Clovis™ securities are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and its common stock is listed on NASDAQ Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 15 4  (ticker symbol: CLVS). Clovis files periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act and related rules thereunder. Throughout the relevant time period, Clovis issued stock to its employees in connection with their exercise of stock options pursuant to Clovis™ stock incentive plan. 10. PATRICK J. MAHAFFY is a resident of this district. Since 2009, he has served as CEO and a director of Clovis. As CEO, Mahaffy reviewed and approved Clovis press releases and filings with the Commission. 11. ERLE T. MAST is a resident of this district. From 2009 to 2016, he served as CFO of Clovis. As CFO, Mast reviewed and approved Clovis press releases and reviewed, approved, and signed Clovis filings with the Commission. During the relevant time period, Mast sold Clovis securities, pursuant to a pre-established 10b5-1 plan, at inflated prices. FACTS  Development of Roci  12. There are various types of lung cancer, one of which is referred to as non-small cell lung cancer (ﬁNSCLCﬂ). Some NSCLC patients can be treated with a class of drugs referred to as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ﬁTKIsﬂ). However, many patients™ disease will progress after treatment on TKIs because of an acquired resistance mutation called a ﬁT790Mﬂ mutation. As a consequence of this mutation, patients become resistant to TKI therapy. Clovis developed Roci to treat NSCLC patients who become resistant to TKIs due to the emergence of the T790M mutation. 13. Before Roci could be sold in the U.S., Clovis needed to obtain approval from the FDA. In March 2012, Clovis began the Phase 1 portion of a Roci clinical trial referred to as ﬁTIGER-X.ﬂ The objective of the Phase 1 portion of TIGER-X was to evaluate Roci™s safety Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 15 5  and determine the appropriate dose for further trials. The Phase 2 portion of TIGER-X, measuring, among other things, Roci™s efficacy, began in February 2014. Clovis publicly disclosed that the primary endpoint of the TIGER-X Phase 2 clinical trial was ORR Œ ﬁObjective Response Rate–per RECIST.ﬂ 14. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (ﬁRECISTﬂ) guidelines are an industry-standard set of guidelines used in evaluating the response, measured by tumor shrinkage, to a cancer drug. Clovis™ protocol for the TIGER-X trial required, per RECIST, that in order for tumor shrinkage to qualify as a response, among other criteria, the targeted tumor must shrink at least 30% and the tumor shrinkage must be sustained in a follow-up examination. This latter requirement is referred to as ﬁconfirmation.ﬂ 15. The data from TIGER-X, and another ongoing Roci clinical trial called TIGER-2 (a Phase 2 study evaluating efficacy that began enrolling patients in June 2014), formed the basis of Clovis™ New Drug Application (ﬁNDAﬂ) submitted to the FDA. The TIGER-X and TIGER-2 data were also going to be used to support Roci™s proposed labeling. A drug™s ﬁlabelﬂ is the printed information that comes with the drug and includes efficacy data such as ORR. 16. Prior to 2015, there were no approved drugs to treat T790M-positive NSCLC patients. However, concurrently with Roci™s development, another company was developing its own drug, referred to herein as DRUG X, to treat the same group of patients. The development of Roci and DRUG X was a race, with analysts and investors carefully comparing Roci™s published efficacy data with DRUG X™s published efficacy data to determine which drug might capture more market share once approved by the FDA. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 15 6  Clovis Tells Investors That Roci™s Efficacy is 60%  17. Clovis disclosed to investors in early 2015 that it expected to submit its NDA to the FDA for Roci in mid-2015. In advance of the NDA submission, Clovis told investors it would give a preview of its label at the ASCO conference in May 2015. The data presentation at ASCO was also a necessary step to raising capital from investors that Clovis needed. 18. At an investor meeting at the ASCO conference on May 31, 2015, Clovis disclosed findings from Phase 2 of TIGER-X, publicly announcing that Clovis™ ﬁrecommendedﬂ or ﬁgo-forwardﬂ dose of Roci would be 500mg and that, at the 500mg dose, Roci™s ORR was 60%. Mahaffy stated that the data ﬁconfirm [Roci™s] compelling activityﬂ and would ﬁform the [NDA submission] in July [2015].ﬂ In its ASCO 2015 presentation, the company developing DRUG X disclosed that its current confirmed ORR was 63%. 19. The disclosed Roci ORR presented at ASCO 2015 and referenced throughout the relevant time period by Clovis was ﬁunconfirmed,ﬂ meaning that the initial tumor shrinkage was not necessarily sustained through a follow-up scan. Clovis™ 60% ORR at ASCO included patients who had a single responsive scan, but then progressed (e.g., their target tumors grew or they developed new tumors) without a confirmatory scan. In other words, Clovis™ 60% ORR at ASCO included some patients who could never be confirmed responders; some patients who had a responsive scan, but had not yet progressed; and some patients who had not had the opportunity for a second responsive scan because they had not been on study long enough. Later analysis of the ASCO data set showed that the confirmed ORR for the ASCO data set at the time it was presented was 40%. 20. In the spring of 2015, Clovis statisticians provided Roci ORR data to Clovis senior clinical personnel showing a divergence between the confirmed and unconfirmed ORR. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 15 7  Although Mahaffy, Mast and some other individuals at Clovis hoped that the FDA would allow Clovis to use Roci™s unconfirmed ORR on Roci™s label, certain senior Clovis employees believed that the FDA would require Clovis to follow RECIST and its own trial protocols in reporting a confirmed ORR on Roci™s label. Clovis Gets Initial NDA Data Showing Lower ORR, But Still Refers to the ASCO 2015 60% ORR In Connection With Raising $298 Million in the Offering  21. On June 19, 2015, Mahaffy and other members of Clovis senior management, not including Mast, received the ﬁclose to finalﬂ TIGER-X data which would be used for the NDA. The unconfirmed ORR was 45.1% for the 500mg dose, or 25% lower than the 60% ORR presented at the ASCO 2015 conference. Mahaffy at the time wrote to a Clovis executive that the data ﬁ[s]eem[ed] worrying.ﬂ 22. After receiving the ﬁclose to finalﬂ TIGER-X data, Clovis prepared drafts of a Prospectus Supplement for filing with the SEC and a roadshow presentation for use in soliciting potential investors in connection with the Offering. Both the Prospectus Supplement and the roadshow presentation referenced that Clovis had presented TIGER-X data showing a 60% ORR at ASCO 2015, but without disclosing that the data was unconfirmed. And in the case of the Prospectus Supplement, Clovis stated that TIGER-X data, combined with data from the ongoing TIGER-2 trial (which had patients on the 625mg dose), would ﬁform the basisﬂ of the forthcoming NDA submission in late July 2015, without disclosing that Roci™s NDA ORR for the 500mg dose was lower than 60%. 23. On July 7, 2015, the day before the Offering, Clovis management, including Mahaffy and Mast, received the ﬁfinalﬂ data to be included in Roci™s initial NDA submission to the FDA. The data showed that Roci™s unconfirmed ORR was 42% for the 500mg dose. The data also showed that Roci™s confirmed ORR was only 31% for the 500mg dose, less than 50% Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 15 8  of DRUG X™s confirmed ORR presented at ASCO. Later that same day, Mahaffy, Mast, and Clovis™ most senior clinical executives conducted an internal conference call to discuss the data. 24. The defendants hoped, based on experience with prior Roci data sets, but did not know to any degree of certainty, that Roci™s ORR would increase by the time of a planned 90- day efficacy update to the initial NDA submission. However, rather than disclose the current Roci ORR and Clovis™ hope that it would increase, Mahaffy and Mast formally approved, in writing, the filing of the Prospectus Supplement with the SEC and the use of the roadshow presentation that both referenced the ASCO 2015 60% ORR. The Prospectus Supplement and the roadshow presentation omitted to disclose material facts necessary to make the reference to the ASCO 2015 data not misleading, including Roci™s current unconfirmed and confirmed ORR. These documents gave investors the false impression that Roci™s ORR continued to be 60%. 25. The following day, on July 8, 2015, Mahaffy led and Mast participated in multiple investor roadshow conference calls without disclosing Roci™s current unconfirmed or confirmed ORR.  During the conference calls Mahaffy described Roci and DRUG X as similarly efficacious. 26. Clovis raised approximately $298 million (net) in connection with the Offering.  Not disclosing the current unconfirmed or confirmed ORR data inflated Clovis™ stock price and enabled Clovis to receive substantial ill-gotten gains from the Offering. Roci™s ORR is Capped, But Clovis Continues to Reference the 60% Number from ASCO  27. On or about July 28, 2015, Clovis™ lead statistician told Clovis™ lead clinician that the confirmed ORR in the NDA would improve only slightly by the time of the planned 90-day efficacy update, if at all. The lead statistician also told the lead clinician, as well as Mahaffy, that the unconfirmed ORR might increase to 46% by the time of the planned 90-day efficacy Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 15 9  update. Mahaffy therefore should have known that Roci™s unconfirmed ORR would not be more than 46% at the time of the 90-day efficacy update. 28. On August 6, 2015, Clovis issued a press release announcing its second-quarter 2015 earnings. Mahaffy and Mast reviewed and approved the issuance of the press release and the accompanying earnings call script. The press release was also furnished to the Commission on Form 8-K and signed by Mast. 29. The press release stated that Clovis had filed its initial NDA on July 30, 2015, and also summarized the data presented at the ASCO 2015 conference, again citing the 60% ORR figure (without disclosing it was unconfirmed) and again stating that the TIGER-X and TIGER-2 data formed the basis of Clovis™ NDA for Roci. During the accompanying investor conference call on August 6, 2015, Mahaffy told investors that Clovis had ﬁpresented a full update of our data set at ASCO,ﬂ giving the false impression that the ASCO 2015 data was consistent with the NDA data. Similarly, Mahaffy further stated on the August 6 investor call that, ﬁ[t]he primary dose we are seeking approval for is 500[mg], and that all comes from TIGER-X and the data you saw at ASCO.ﬂ In describing the data submitted in the NDA, Mahaffy further claimed that the ﬁdata sets have continued to demonstrate compelling and consistent activity.ﬂ 30. In approximately September 2015, another biopharmaceutical company (ﬁCompany Yﬂ) conducted due diligence, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, as to Roci in connection with a potential acquisition of Clovis. When Company Y learned during the due diligence of the undisclosed ORR data concerning Roci Œ the same data that Clovis submitted to the FDA in its NDA Œ it withdrew from the potential acquisition of Clovis. The defendants knew or should have known that Company Y™s view was that Roci would not be competitive with DRUG X. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 15 10  31. The 90-day efficacy update for Roci, submitted to the FDA on October 22, 2015, showed confirmed ORR of 33% and unconfirmed ORR of 46% for the 500mg dose. The 90-day efficacy update data was shared and discussed with Mahaffy and Mast before it was submitted to the FDA. 32. On November 5, 2015, after submitting the 90-day efficacy update, Clovis issued a press release announcing its third-quarter 2015 earnings. Mahaffy and Mast reviewed and approved the issuance of the press release and the accompanying earnings call script. The press release was also furnished to the Commission on Form 8-K and signed by Mast. 33. In the press release and on the accompanying earnings conference call led by Mahaffy, Clovis highlighted medical presentations of Roci data that occurred during the third quarter and directed investors to review the presentations on Clovis™ website. These medical presentations again highlighted the ASCO 2015 data and the 60% ORR at the 500mg dose, without disclosing that the data was unconfirmed, or disclosing the lower ORR data submitted in the initial NDA submission, or disclosing the lower ORR data submitted to the FDA in connection with the 90-day efficacy update. Clovis™ Disclosures Misled Investors  34. Clovis™ references during the relevant time period to the ASCO presentation and its highlighting of the 60% ORR figure for the 500mg dose were misleading because the data submitted to the FDA showed response rates far below 60% for that dose, on either a confirmed or unconfirmed basis. Investors fairly understood that the ORR in the NDA submission, and the eventual Roci label, would be substantially similar to the 60% ASCO figure, when in fact the undisclosed data Œ which Clovis provided to the FDA Œ showed ORR ranging between 31% (confirmed) and 46% (unconfirmed). Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 15 11  35. Further, investors believed that the 60% ORR was ﬁconfirmed.ﬂ Presenting an ORR comprised of only confirmed responses was customary, and therefore investors would have expected Clovis to disclose if it was deviating from customary practice and its own clinical trial protocols by presenting unconfirmed ORR. Indeed, even a Clovis employee involved with medical publications believed that the ASCO 60% ORR represented a confirmed response rate. 36. The continued use of the 60% ORR figure, without disclosing that it was unconfirmed, and without disclosing that the data submitted to the FDA showed responses rates far below 60%, on either a confirmed or unconfirmed basis, led investors to the false conclusion that Roci and DRUG X had similar efficacy and therefore that Roci would be competitive in the marketplace. As late as November 6, 2015, analysts continued to cite Roci™s ﬁ60% response rateﬂ in concluding that Roci™s efficacy was ﬁvery similarﬂ to DRUG X. Clovis™ Subsequent Disclosure of Roci™s Confirmed ORR  37. On Friday, November 6, 2015, the FDA sent a memorandum to Clovis in advance of a planned conference call on November 9, 2015, referred to as the ﬁMid-Cycle Communication.ﬂ In the memorandum and conference call on November 9, 2015, the FDA informed Clovis that its seeking approval for Roci on the basis of unconfirmed data that deviated from RECIST was unacceptable, and that the accurately calculated confirmed ORR may not be of sufficient magnitude to predict clinical benefit. Mahaffy and Mast both received the FDA™s November 6, 2015 memorandum, and were informed following the November 9, 2015 conference call that the FDA would not change its position that Clovis must use confirmed ORR. 38. On November 10, 2015, Mast was scheduled to attend an investor conference that Mahaffy was originally scheduled to attend. Mahaffy and Mast spoke prior to the conference, and they decided together that Mast would still attend the conference. During the conference, Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 15 12  Mast spoke from a deck of slides that was displayed overhead for investors to see and also posted to Clovis™ website. Even though Mahaffy and Mast knew or should have known that the FDA would require confirmed ORR, one of the slides included the ASCO 2015 60% ORR for the 500mg dose, but without disclosing that fact or the accurate ORR. 39. On November 16, 2015, Clovis disclosed that Roci™s confirmed ORR for the NDA dataset was only 28%. When Clovis disclosed the true ORR, analysts reported that they were ﬁshockedﬂ and ﬁblindsided.ﬂ Analysts also concluded that Roci™s ORR was now ﬁmeaningfully lowerﬂ than DRUG X and, accordingly, ﬁreduced its competitiveness substantially.ﬂ As a result, on November 16, 2015, Clovis™ stock price closed down approximately 70%, or $69.19 per share (from a closing price of $99.43 per share on Friday, November 13, 2015 to a closing price of $30.24 per share on November 16). By May 2016, after receiving further feedback from the FDA, Clovis had ceased development of Roci and terminated enrollment in all Clovis-sponsored clinical studies of Roci.

Miller  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Denver Regional Office 1961 Stout Street, Suite 1700 Denver, CO 80294 (303) 844-1000  Attorneys for Plaintiff Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 15","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company's developmental lung cancer drug.The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug. According to the complaint, the company's investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally. Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent. The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016.According to the SEC's complaint, in evaluating Clovis' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its ""efficacy,"" or how well the drug worked. In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci's efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company's CFO at that time, showed that Roci's efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent. Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward. In November 2015, after Clovis disclosed the true efficacy, using the methodology required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its stock price dropped approximately 70 percent.The SEC's complaint charges Clovis with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint charges Mahaffy with violating Section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting Clovis' violations of Section 13(a). The complaint charges Mast with aiding and abetting Clovis' federal securities laws violations. The defendants agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the allegations and the settlements are subject to court approval. Clovis agreed to a $20 million penalty. Mahaffy agreed to a $250,000 penalty. Mast agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and to provide disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $454,145, attributable to selling Clovis stock during the relevant period at inflated prices. The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalties to harmed investors.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Cates and Kim Greer and supervised by Ian Karpel and Kurt Gottschall in the Denver Regional Office."
3,"1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA SAVANNAH DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, Civil Action File No. v.        _______________ JARED GABRIEL FORRESTER, Defendant. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF The plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint and alleges the following: SUMMARY 1.Between at least December 2013 and February 2016, Defendant Jared GabrielForrester (ﬁForresterﬂ) was directly involved in a scheme by David R. Greenlee (ﬁGreenleeﬂ) and David A. Stewart, Jr. (ﬁStewartﬂ) that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors.   2.From 2013 through February 2016, Greenlee, Stewart, their principal salesman,Richard P. Underwood (ﬁUnderwoodﬂ), and other salesmen whom Greenlee and Stewart recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold interests in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 1 of 14   2 3.   In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to (a) acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in various oil wells and (b) employ enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells.  Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also told investors that the entities would sell the oil in order to earn for investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent, or more, per year ﬁfor decades.ﬂ 4. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, Southern Energy Group, Inc. (ﬁSEGﬂ), which is now administratively dissolved, and Black Gold Resources, Inc. (ﬁBGRﬂ), which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc. (ﬁTennstarﬂ). 5. Greenlee, Stewart, and Underwood represented to investors that SEG would manage the limited partnerships and Tennstar would manage the joint ventures, and that each of these companies would be headed by an individual with meaningful experience in the oil industry. 6. Greenlee and Stewart installed figurehead executives for SEG and Tennstar who pretended to run the companies so that Greenlee and StewartŠboth convicted felonsŠcould conceal their own involvement in the scheme. 7. Forrester was the figurehead installed over Tennstar, and he knew that he was falsely portrayed to investors as both running the company and experienced in the oil industry. VIOLATIONS 8. Forrester, by virtue of his conduct, engaged in direct violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].   Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 2 of 14   3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and (d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b)-(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)-(e)] to enjoin Forrester from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar purport and object, for disgorgement of illegally obtained funds, prejudgment interest and other equitable relief, and for civil money penalties. 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. 11. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, has made use of the mails and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 12. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act and Exchange Act have occurred within the Southern District of Georgia.   DEFENDANT  13. Forrester, 35 and a resident of Summer Shade, Kentucky, was the purported President and CEO of Tennstar between December 2013 and February 2016, when the fraud was halted by the US Secret Service.  He was selected by Greenlee and Stewart to be Tennstar™s figurehead because he was known to both of them from their mutual involvement in an earlier, unrelated investment scheme.  Forrester previously worked as a hotel clerk, furniture store Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 3 of 14   4 salesman, and stock broker trainee at a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser that is unrelated to Tennstar or SEG.  Forrester currently works as a roofer.  In August 2016, the Tennessee Securities Division issued a cease-and-desist order against Tennstar and Forrester, finding that both made material misrepresentations to investors regarding the profitability of Tennstar investments. OTHER RELEVANT PEOPLE AND ENTITY 13. David R. Greenlee, age 42, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was convicted in state court and served time in a Kentucky prison during 1999 to 2000 for forgery and burglary, and again in 2004 for vehicular manslaughter. 14. David A. Stewart, Jr., age 46, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was a registered representative with two Commission-registered broker-dealers in 2001 and 2002.  In April 2007, Stewart was convicted of federal income tax evasion and sentenced to federal prison.  Later, in 2008, the Alabama Securities Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against Stewart, among others, for previously participating in a separate oil and gas offering scheme.  15.  Tennstar was a Tennessee corporation and the purported managing general partner of at least seven well-drilling joint ventures sold to investors.  Tennstar was dissolved by the State of Tennessee in August 2017 for failure to meet registration renewal requirements.  It never registered any stock or offerings with the Commission. 16. On August 11, 2017, the Commission filed a complaint in SEC v. Tennstar Energy, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:17-cv-00151 (S.D. Ga.), alleging violation of the antifraud statutes of the federal securities laws by Tennstar, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood.    Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 4 of 14   5 FACTS A. Background  17. Between at least January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlee and Stewart, acting individually and through a network of salesmen whom they recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests, called ﬁunits,ﬂ in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 18. Specifically, as described in the SEG and Tennstar offering materials and the corresponding certificates of ownership given to investors, individuals investing funds in the projects were buying fractional undivided working interests, which in turn provided net revenue interests for any profits derived from the purported plans to sell oil recovered from the wells at issue.   19. For example, the offering materials for Tennstar™s joint ventures explained: ﬁThe fraction thus obtained will represent the fractional interest of each such Venturer in the costs and revenues, if any, of the [Tennstar project].ﬂ  SEG offering materials used similar language regarding the interests sold through SEG™s partnerships. 20. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through SEG for the limited partnerships and Tennstar for the joint ventures. 21. Each company was purportedly run by an individual experienced in the oil industry. 22. In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and their sales teams represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in various oil wells, employ techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells, Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 5 of 14   6 and sell the oil to earn investors returnsŠin the form of revenue interestsŠranging from 15 to 55 percent or more per year, which they said would last for decades. 23. In fact, while Greenlee and Stewart used some investor money at several wells to create an appearance of activity to dupe investors who wanted to see the wells in production, they used nearly two-thirds of the $15 million raised for their own benefit or to pay the costs of conducting the fraud, such as radio and internet advertising. 24. Given their criminal backgrounds, Greenlee and Stewart used fake names when soliciting investors to conceal their involvement in the scheme. B. Forrester Directly Violated the Antifraud Provisions of the Securities Laws  25. Forrester was the figurehead installed by Greenlee and Stewart to run Tennstar. 26. Forrester was portrayed to investors as running Tennstar when, in reality, that entity was controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.  27. Forrester incorporated the company at their request using $18,000 they provided, listed himself as Tennstar™s registered agent, and opened the entity™s offices in Tennessee and South Florida to house its boiler-room sales staff. 28. When investors ultimately provided their money to Tennstar, Forrester followed instructions from Greenlee and Stewart regarding how much to pay to the sales team, how much to spend on advertising, and how much to funnel to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart for personal misappropriationŠnone of which was disclosed to investors as anticipated use of their funds. 29. In addition to allowing himself to be portrayed falsely as running the company, Forrester was also active in the offer and sale of investments in Tennstar™s offerings.  In fact, he was the Tennstar employee who typically was listed on shipping labels as the sender of offering Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 6 of 14   7 materials via mail or common carrier to investors, knowing that those materials included a fake biography of himself.   For example, in July 2015, Forrester sent by common carrier a package of Tennstar offering materials to a Southern District of Georgia resident in Savannah, Georgia.  The materials included the false biography of Forrester.  The Southern District of Georgia resident ultimately invested $28,000 in a Tennstar offering, but never received any profits or distributions from the investment. 30. That fake biography claimed that Forrester, who was 29 years old when his role in the Tennstar fraud began, ﬁhad a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the yearsﬂ and had been ﬁpart of the 30+ years of [oil] field projects that his family ha[d] developed.ﬂ  The biography, written chiefly by Stewart and approved by Forrester, then asserted that Forrester™s experience had given him ﬁground-level field development expertise in the oil patchﬂ and ﬁan immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits.ﬂ   31. None of this was true since, prior to his figurehead role at Tennstar, Forrester had never worked in any legitimate oil drilling or production effort, nor had Forrester™s family members ever been involved in ﬁ30+ years of [oil] field projects.ﬂ 32. Forrester knew Greenlee and Stewart were using fake names when soliciting investors, and he touted his own fake industry experience in verbal solicitations of investors.   33. For instance, in an audio file created by Tennstar in what appears to have been an effort to coach and train its salesmen, Forrester was recorded on a telephone call soliciting a prospective investor to purchase an interest in a Tennstar joint venture.  During the call, Forrester told the prospective investor that Forrester had been in the oil business almost all of his life, claiming at one point during the call that he had worked in the industry since he was ﬁin diapers.ﬂ   Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 7 of 14   8 34. Additionally, when soliciting investors, Forrester used call scripts provided by Greenlee and Stewart for the boiler-room sales teams, claiming falsely that investments in Tennstar™s joint ventures were low risk and profitable.  Forrester knew such claims were false because, among other things, as head of Tennstar he signed and distributed investor distribution checks and knew most investors were receiving little, if any, return on their invested funds. 35. For instance, in July 2014, Forrester solicited and sold a Tennstar joint interest investment to a male investor, then a 50 year-old Florida resident.   36. The Florida investor initially had contacted SEGŠthe other fraudulent entity controlled by Greenlee and StewartŠafter hearing an SEG radio advertisement about oil investment opportunities.  In response to the Florida investor™s inquiry, Forrester called the Florida investor and, after asking about the Florida investor™s income, told him that his earnings were insufficient to invest in an SEG opportunity, but noted that the Florida investor could invest in a Tennstar joint venture instead.   37. In soliciting the Florida investor, Forrester falsely told the man that SEG and BGR were unrelated and that Forrester had ﬁworked his way up through the oil fieldsﬂ and had been in the oil industry ﬁhis whole adult life.ﬂ   38. When the Florida investor asked Forrester if the Tennstar offering wasŠin his wordsŠﬁon the up and up,ﬂ Forrester responded by telling him, as the Florida investor recalled:  ﬁI™m a man of God.  I love my family and my faith is most important to me.  And I™m not lying to you.ﬂ   39. After hearing this, the Florida investor told Forrester to send him further information on the offering, which Forrester did by sending him offering materials by common carrier that contained Forrester™s fake biography. Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 8 of 14   9 40. After receiving these materials, the Florida investor had another call with Forrester.  During this call, the Florida investor asked Forrester about the risks of a Tennstar investment.  Forrester responded by telling the Florida investor not to worry about risk because Forrester™s prior experience in the oil industry was alleviating that risk.   41. Forrester further told the Florida investor that he could receive a 30 percent return on his investment, adding, as the Florida investor recalled, that the ﬁoil flow is expected to last for decades, if not longer.ﬂ   42. Based on Forrester™s representations about the investment and his supposed industry experience, the Florida investor invested a total of $80,000 into two separate Tennstar joint venture offeringsŠan amount that the Florida investor described to Forrester as being almost all of his life savings.  The Florida investor, in making his investment decision, believed that Forrester™s purported experience would make the joint ventures successful. 43. Subsequently, in February 2015, Forrester told the Florida investor in letters that he signed as Tennstar™s President and CEO that the oil wells in which the Florida investor had invested had turned out to be dry.   44. Forrester assured the Florida investor that his investment would be moved to a different Tennstar joint venture but that no new paperwork was necessary.  Forrester further assured the Florida investor that the new joint venture was a ﬁsure thing.ﬂ   45. The Florida investor eventually received a few small distribution checks from Tennstar, totaling no more than $550.  He never received his promised return on his investment or any refund of his invested amount.  Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 9 of 14   10 46. During the fraud while under the purported direction of Forrester, Tennstar offered and sold to more than 90 investors at least $2.7 million of units in at least seven joint ventures.   47. Of these funds, Forrester paid himself at least $233,711.60. COUNT IŠFRAUD   Violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1)]  48.

He misled investors by failing to disclose that two convicted felons actually were running the company. Despite having no background in oil drilling or production efforts, Tennstar's website allegedly described Forrester as having ""an immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits."" Tennstar offering materials also allegedly claimed that Forrester ""had a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the years."" The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had ""worked his way up through the oil fields"" and had been in the industry during his ""whole adult life."" However, Forrester's work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee.Last year, the SEC charged David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use. In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme. For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian M.

PAULSEN,    )     Jury Trial Demanded          )    Defendant.  )     ___________________________________  )  COMPLAINT  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows: Nature of the Action  1. This action concerns Defendant John A. Paulsen, a former analyst at a broker-dealer headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama (ﬁBroker-Dealerﬂ), who aided and abetted a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund (the ﬁNYSCRFﬂ or the ﬁFundﬂ), Deborah D. Kelley, and Navnoor S. Kang. 2. From early 2014 until February 2016, Kang was the Director of Fixed Income and Head Portfolio Strategist of the NYSCRF, the third largest public pension fund in the United States, with investment responsibility for approximately $50 billion of the Fund™s assets.   3. During the course of Kang™s employment, Kang solicited and received improper gifts and entertainment from Kelley, a former registered representative at the Broker-Dealer.  In exchange, Kang directed public pension trades to Kelley at the Broker-Dealer, and Kelley earned sizable commissions.   4. Paulsen and Kelley were colleagues at the Broker-Dealer.  In February 2015, Paulsen and Kelley planned a ski trip in Park City, Utah for the purpose of entertaining Kang.  Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 1 of 18 2 As part of the trip, Paulsen and Kelley incurred more than $11,000 in expenses entertaining Kang and Kang™s girlfriend.   5. Paulsen and Kelley sought reimbursement of those expenses from the Broker-Dealer, and intentionally hid the fact that Kang was on the trip by not including Kang™s name on their expense reports.   6. Later, when the Broker-Dealer discovered inconsistencies in the reports and began an internal investigation, Kelley and Paulsen conspired to lie, and did lie, to the Broker-Dealer™s internal investigators about Kang™s presence on the trip. 7. Kang violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by directing Fund business to Kelley in exchange for gifts and entertainment, while failing to disclose his receipt of those improper benefits to the Fund.  Kelley violated the antifraud provisions by providing the undisclosed benefits to Kang as part of the fraudulent quid pro quo scheme with Kang.   8. Paulsen knowingly provided substantial assistance to Kelley and Kang by participating in the entertainment of Kang, then hiding his and Kelley™s provision of benefits to Kang by submitting false expense reports, and lying to the internal investigators.  Paulsen also facilitated Kang™s and Kelley™s quid pro quo scheme by allowing it to go undetected by the Broker-Dealer and the Fund.  In doing so, Paulsen aided and abetted Kelley™s and Kang™s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) ], Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1), (a)(3)].  9. Unless Paulsen is permanently restrained and enjoined, he will again engage in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint, and in acts, Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 2 of 18 3 practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar type and object. Jurisdiction and Venue  10. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred by Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)], seeking to restrain and enjoin permanently Defendant from engaging in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein.  The Commission also seeks a final judgment ordering Defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [at U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)].  11. This Court has jurisdiction over this action, and venue lies in this District, pursuant to Sections 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 20(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.  §§ 78t(d) and 78aa(a)].  Defendant, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in, and the means or instrumentalities of, interstate commerce, or of the mails in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein.  Some of the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business at issue occurred in the Southern District of New York.   Defendant 12.  John A. Paulsen, age 57, resides in Park Ridge, New Jersey.  From June 2013 through March 2015, Paulsen was a Managing Director at the Broker-Dealer.  Prior to that, Paulsen worked at a number of registered broker-dealers dating back to 1993.  From April 2015 through the present, Paulsen has been the Head of Research at a registered investment adviser based in Wilton, Connecticut.  Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 3 of 18   4 Other Relevant Persons 13. Navnoor S. Kang, age 38, resides in Saratoga Springs, New York.  From January 2014 until his termination in February 2016, Kang was the Director of Fixed Income and Head Portfolio Strategist for the NYSCRF, a public pension fund managed by the New York State Comptroller.   14. Deborah D. Kelley, age 60, resides in Piedmont, California.  From January 2012 through August 2015, Kelley was a registered representative of the Broker-Dealer and its successor, a registered broker-dealer based in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Facts 15. Kelley met Kang while he was employed as a portfolio associate with a well-known asset management firm, and she had a business relationship with him for a period of time while he was working as a vice president and fixed income trader with another prominent asset management firm (ﬁAsset Managerﬂ).   16. Paulsen first met Kang when he worked at the Asset Manager, and they had occasional business interactions. 17. At some point in or around 2012, Kang accepted an $8,000 Rolex watch from a registered representative of a broker-dealer, which Kang did not disclose to the Asset Manager. 18. In late 2012, an internal investigation by the Asset Manager into Kang™s activities concluded that he had accepted Rolling Stones concert tickets valued at $1,200 from a registered representative of a broker-dealer doing business with the Asset Manager.     19. In addition, the investigation determined that Kang failed to report at least 54 additional instances where he received benefits and entertainment.  The Asset Manager terminated Kang in January 2013 for violations of its compliance and ethics policies based on his Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 4 of 18   5 improper receipt of, and failure to report, these benefits and entertainment.  The Asset Manager informed Kang that he was being terminated for these reasons. 20. Between January 2013 and January 2014, Kang was unemployed and actively seeking work.  Kelley remained in contact with Kang and assisted him in his job search Œ all in an effort to maintain and cultivate their business relationship.   Kang™s Employment By And Duties To The NYSCRF 21. In January 2014, the NYSCRF hired Kang as its Director of Fixed Income and Head Portfolio Strategist.  During his job interview with the NYSCRF, Kang lied about the reason he was terminated by the Asset Manager.  Kelley provided a reference to the NYSCRF on Kang™s behalf. 22. As the Director of Fixed Income at the Fund, Kang made investment decisions, supervised seven investment officers, and was responsible for approximately $50 billion of the Fund™s assets that were held in fixed-income securities.   23. Under New York State Law, the New York State Comptroller, and anyone to whom he or she delegates powers of investment, is a fiduciary of the Fund.  Because Kang was delegated powers of investment by the Comptroller, he was a fiduciary to the Fund.  As a fiduciary, Kang was required to act solely in the interests of the members and beneficiaries of the Fund, and was prohibited from receiving any consideration from any party other than the Office of the State Comptroller in connection with a transaction involving the Fund. 24. The NYSCRF maintains a ﬁCode of Conductﬂ containing standards for the management of the Fund.  The Code of Conduct applies to all employees of the Office of the State Comptroller who have responsibility for matters relating to the Fund.  Among other things, the Code of Conduct mandates that the Fund shall ﬁbe managed in accordance with the highest Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 5 of 18   6 ethical, professional and conflict of interest standards,ﬂ and actions on behalf of the Fund ﬁshall be for the sole benefit of the Retirement System™s members, retirees and beneficiaries.ﬂ 25. Kang received training on the Fund™s policies and codes, as well as applicable New York State Law, and certified as to his understanding of the prohibitions contained therein regarding the receipt of gifts, meals, travel, and entertainment. 26. Kang had an affirmative and continuing duty to disclose to the Fund his solicitation and acceptance of travel, entertainment, and benefits.  Kang was required to report the receipt of anything more than nominal value from interested parties.   27. During his tenure with the Fund, Kang made no such disclosures.  Furthermore, Kang filed a certification with the Fund in which he represented that he had received no gifts in excess of $1000.  This certification was false. 28. Shortly after Kang joined the Fund, Paulsen and Kang had an in-person meeting.  At the meeting, Kang told Paulsen that the Fund had very strict rules which prohibited him from accepting anything from Paulsen.   Kelley Corruptly Provides Kang With Undisclosed Gifts And Entertainment 29. Kelley provided thousands of dollars™ worth of benefits and entertainment to Kang in exchange for access to NYSCRF business, despite the fact that her colleagues had warned her to avoid such behavior.   30. Specifically, in a February 6, 2014 email (immediately prior to Kelley beginning her coverage of the NYSCRF account), another registered representative at the Broker-Dealer told Kelley to ﬁremember these guys cannot be entertained as they are a state fund.ﬂ   31. Nevertheless, Kelley soon thereafter planned a trip to New Orleans for herself, her husband, Kang, and Kang™s girlfriend, which took place in October 2014.   Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 6 of 18   7 32. On this trip, Kelley spent, and then expensed to the Broker-Dealer, more than $8,000 for the four of them on meals, drinks, and entertainment, including $6,000 for four VIP tickets to a Paul McCartney concert.   33. Kelley intentionally omitted the names of Kang and his girlfriend from her expense reports.  Instead, she falsely reported that clients from a private firm had attended the trip.   Paulsen And Kelley Corruptly Provide Kang And  His Girlfriend With Undisclosed Gifts And Entertainment On A Ski Trip  34. On November 6, 2014, Kang called Paulsen and raised the idea of a ski trip.  Paulsen mentioned the idea to Kelley, and Kelley then planned a ski trip to Park City, Utah, which took place in February 2015. 35. The ski trip was originally scheduled to begin on Thursday, February 12, 2015, with Paulsen, Kelley, Kelley™s husband, Kang, and Kang™s girlfriend attending.  Kelley and Paulsen learned prior to the trip that Kang and his girlfriend would not arrive in Park City until Friday, February 13.  Paulsen asked Kelley via Bloomberg instant message whether they should adjust their arrival date ﬁor just keep it :-).ﬂ  Kelley replied, ﬁI™m still coming in Thurs :-).ﬂ 36. Between them, Kelley and Paulsen spent and expensed more than $11,000 for skiing, hotel rooms, dinners, and drinks.  These expenses included the costs of limousine service, two lunches, two dinners, ski rentals, ski lessons, and three nights at the Hotel Park City (at more than $1,100 per night) for Kang and his girlfriend. Paulsen And Kelley Submit False Expense Reports To The Broker-Dealer 37. After the trip, Paulsen and Kelley discussed how they would handle Kang™s attendance on the ski trip when they submitted their expense reports.  Kelley told Paulsen that Kang™s name, and Kang™s girlfriend™s name, could not appear on their expense reports.  Paulsen Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 7 of 18   8 and Kelley agreed that they would keep Kang™s attendance on the trip a secret.  Paulsen understood Kelley would not mention Kang or his girlfriend on her expense reports.  Paulsen planned to do the same thing. 38. Kelley submitted false expense reports to the Broker-Dealer.  On her expense reports, she concealed from the Broker-Dealer the fact that Kang and his girlfriend were on the trip, listing other customers and personal acquaintances Œ none of whom were in Park City at the time. 39. Paulsen also submitted false expense reports.  On February 19, 2015, Paulsen requested reimbursement from the Broker-Dealer for a $363 dinner that occurred on Thursday, February 12, 2015, prior to Kang™s arrival in Park City.  On his expense report, Paulsen represented that five people attended the dinner:  Paulsen, Kelley, Kelley™s husband, and two employees of a prominent asset management firm, a client of the Broker-Dealer.  In fact, these two individuals were not at the dinner, nor were they even in Park City at the time.   40. Paulsen knew that, at the time he submitted the expense report, the Broker-Dealer would not ask questions if he listed client guests on the report.  Paulsen also knew that he needed to justify his and Kelley™s presence in Park City, because the real reason they were there Œ to entertain Kang Œ could not be disclosed. 41. Paulsen also requested reimbursement from the Broker-Dealer for a $125 lunch that occurred on February 14, 2015.  On his expense report, he represented that the guests were himself, Kelley, Kelley™s husband, and an analyst at an investment advisory firm.  In truth, the analyst was neither at the lunch nor in Park City at the time.  The actual lunch receipt from the restaurant indicated that five guests attended the lunch.  The other two guests were Kang and his girlfriend.  Paulsen intentionally omitted Kang™s name from his expense report because he knew, Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 8 of 18   9 and had previously discussed and agreed with Kelley, that Kang could not be mentioned on his expense reports. 42. When he submitted his expense report, Paulsen attached a printout of an email exchange he had on February 25, 2015 (after the trip) with the Broker-Dealer™s Head of Fixed Income Sales (and Kelley™s supervisor).  In the email exchange, Paulsen asked the Head of Fixed Income Sales to confirm, in writing, his preapproval of Paulsen™s February 2015 client trip (which included the ski trip).  Paulsen listed six customers that he saw during the trip.  The email did not mention Kang or the Fund. 43. On February 26, 2015, Kelley and Paulsen engaged in the following conversation via Bloomberg instant message: DK: Lose[sic] lips sink ships! No talky re ski trip si vous plait JP: I have not said anything DK: Allen says he heard about it from you and that we were with Nav and ﬁgorgeousﬂ gf JP: I mentioned to Allen yes. sorry JP: Told him to stay quiet. He was talking about the energy trade you did yesterday DK: ah - xoxo - just need to be SO careful JP: I know. DK: let™s not mention to anyone else - AR, AO, and JW know. JP: ok JP: I put my expenses in and did not mention them . . .  JP: for the [February 12] dinner at Mustang I put down Yuri and Del Anderson JP: is that ok? Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 9 of 18   10 DK: perf 44. Kang did not disclose his receipt of any of these meals, travel, or entertainment to the NYSCRF. Kang Corruptly Rewards Kelley With Lucrative Bond Trading Business 45. In exchange for these benefits, Kang steered lucrative NYSCRF bond trading business to the Broker-Dealer, resulting in substantial personal gain for Kelley.   46. When Kang first arrived at the NYSCRF, there were a very small number of brokers approved to execute fixed income trades directly for the Fund.   47. Kang set out to expand the list of approved brokers under the guise of facilitating additional liquidity and obtaining best execution.   48. On June 10, 2014, at Kang™s direction, the Fund initiated a fixed income broker search to select brokers for its internally managed assets.  Interested entities were required to submit applications, which were then reviewed internally by a group led by Kang.   49. Kelley submitted an application on behalf of the Broker-Dealer.   50. Several months later, on November 6, 2014, the same date Kang called Paulsen to suggest the ski trip, Kang sent a memorandum to the NYSCRF™s CIO recommending that eight brokers be added to the approved list.  The recommended brokers included the Broker-Dealer, and all eight brokers were approved.   51. Although Kang indicated in his memorandum that the eight brokers would be required to submit to a ﬁfull due diligence processﬂ conducted by an outside firm, no such process ever took place.  Accordingly, the eight brokers were approved based solely on the recommendation contained in Kang™s November 6, 2014 memorandum. 52. Prior to the Broker-Dealer becoming an approved broker, Kang was directing trades to the Broker-Dealer through one of the Fund™s approved brokers (ﬁApproved Broker-Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 10 of 18 Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 11 of 18   12 Paulsen, Kelley, And Kang Continue Their Attempts To Keep The Scheme A Secret 56. At the end of March 2015, Paulsen left the Broker-Dealer to take a job at an investment adviser firm.  Shortly thereafter, the Broker-Dealer™s in-house counsel contacted Paulsen as part of its internal investigation into Kelley™s entertainment of Kang.  Paulsen was asked to consent to an interview by the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel, and he agreed to do so.   57. Shortly thereafter, Paulsen called Kelley and asked if she knew the purpose of the internal investigation.  Kelley said that she believed the Broker-Dealer was looking into the ski trip, and that the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel had also scheduled an interview with her.  Paulsen told Kelley that he would delay his interview until after Kelley™s so that they could speak again after Kelley™s interview and align their stories. 58. The Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel interviewed Kelley on April 29, 2015.  During the interview, Kelley repeatedly lied about Kang™s participation in the ski trip and her paying for Kang™s expenses.   59. After Kelley™s interview, Kelley told Paulsen what she had been asked, and what she had said.  Paulsen agreed with Kelley to tell the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel a story consistent with Kelley™s Œ in other words, Paulsen agreed to lie during his interview. 60. When the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel asked Paulsen about the February 14, 2015 lunch, Paulsen attempted to line up his account of what happened with what Kelley had told the investigators.  Paulsen said that the investment analyst that he previously identified was not present at the lunch.  Instead, Paulsen claimed (as had Kelley) that some of Kelley™s friends joined them when, in fact, Kang and his girlfriend were there.   61. Paulsen told other lies during the interview to attempt to corroborate Kelley™s false account.  Paulsen falsely told the Broker-Dealer™s outside counsel that, while Kang was in Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 12 of 18   13 Park City during the weekend of the ski trip, he was there on his own and did not go out with Paulsen and Kelley.  Paulsen also said that Kang was not staying at the same hotel as Kelley, when, in fact, Paulsen knew that Kang and Kelley stayed at the same hotel.  Paulsen also said that he saw Kang for the first time in Park City on February 15, 2015, when in fact Paulsen, Kelley, and Kelley™s husband had had lunch and dinner with Kang and his girlfriend the previous day.  62. During the interview, Paulsen also said that Kang paid for food and drinks for the group after skiing on February 15, 2015.  While Paulsen claimed that he did not remember why Kang insisted on paying, he posited that maybe Kelley had paid for something earlier in the day and Kang needed to offset it.  This was the false narrative that Paulsen and Kelley had agreed to tell the investigators.  In fact, Kang did not pay for food and drinks, and the concept of Kang attempting to repay Kelley was a fabrication. 63. Paulsen then said that he had dinner that night with Kelley, Kelley™s husband, and Kelley™s two friends.  This was another part of the false narrative that Paulsen and Kelley conspired to tell the investigators.  In fact, Kang and his girlfriend were at that dinner; Kelley™s friends were not.   64. At the end of his interview, Paulsen lied again, saying that he never witnessed Kang being entertained on the ski trip. 65. On August 10, 2015, the Broker-Dealer terminated Kelley and, on February 22, 2016, the NYSCRF terminated Kang. 66. On May 30, 2017, based in part on the conduct described in this Complaint, Kelley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, each of which Kelley committed while she was a registered representative of Case 1:18-cv-06718   Document 1   Filed 07/26/18   Page 13 of 18   14 the Broker-Dealer and its successor.  United States v. Kelley, 16-CR-837 (S.D.N.Y.).  Kelley was sentenced to three years™ probation, with 6 months™ home confinement and one thousand hours of community service, and was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and $242,724.17 in restitution to the NYSCRF.   67. On November 8, 2017, based in part on the conduct described herein, Kang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud in the matter of United States v. Kang, 16-CR-837 (S.D.N.Y.).  Kang was sentenced to 21 months™ imprisonment and three years™ supervised release, and ordered to pay $242,724.17 in restitution to the NYSCRF and to forfeit $78,716.00.

Paulsen, a former managing director and fixed income research analyst at a registered broker-dealer, for aiding and abetting a pay-to-play scheme involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund.As alleged in the SEC's complaint, from early 2014 until February 2016, Navnoor S. Kang was the Fund's Director of Fixed Income, with investment responsibility for approximately $50 billion of the Fund's assets. According to the SEC's complaint, Kang used his position at the Fund to solicit and receive improper entertainment from Paulsen and Deborah D. Kelley, a registered representative at the broker-dealer. In exchange, Kang directed millions of dollars in state business to the broker-dealer, generating sizable commissions.The SEC alleges that Paulsen and Kelley planned a ski trip for the purpose of entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. The complaint alleges that Kang told Paulsen and Kelley that the Fund had very strict rules that prohibited him from accepting anything from Paulsen. Yet, according to the complaint, Paulsen and Kelley spent thousands of dollars entertaining Kang and his girlfriend. Paulsen and Kelley then sought reimbursement of those expenses from the broker-dealer, and submited false expense reports which concealed the fact they had entertained Kang on the trip. Later, when the broker-dealer discovered inconsistencies in the expense reports and began an internal investigation, Paulsen and Kelley conspired to lie, and did lie, to the broker-dealer's internal investigators.The SEC's complaint charges Paulsen with aiding and abetting Kang and Kelley's violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction and disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties.The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Public Finance Abuse Unit members Brian Fagel and Eric Celauro.

In connection with the conduct alleged in the Complaint, Defendant, directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in the interstate commerce, and of the mails. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  A. Unregistered Securities Offerings  10. Between October 2010 and October 2015, Aegis raised a total of approximately $35 million from about 250 investors nationwide through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and sales of securities in a continuous series of 15 offerings.  See SEC v. Aegis Oil, LLC, et al., Civil Action No. 16-cv-62335-BB (S.D. Fla., Sept. 29, 2016). 11. Between November 2014 and July 2016, 7S, which previously served as the field operator for the Aegis projects, began offering and selling its own investments in oil well projects to the public.  During this period, 7S raised approximately $7 million from at least 70 investors through the fraudulent, unregistered offers and sales of securities in a continuous series of 8 offerings.  See SEC v. 7S Oil & Gas, LLC, et al., Civil Action No. 17-cv-22914-UU (S.D. Fla., Aug. 1, 2017).  12. The securities sold in all offerings were investment contracts in the form of Aegis and 7S offered and sold their securities to the public primarily through a network of sales agents, who would cold-call potential investors throughout the country using lead lists.  Aegis generally paid its sales agents a 35% commission on each sale, which came o7S paid its agents commissions ranging from 20% to 35%, also out of investor money.  Neither Aegis nor 7S disclosed to investors the payment of commissions higher than 10%. Case 0:18-cv-61870-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 3 of 10 4  13. Sales agents pitched the Aegis and 7S securities to potential investors based on promises of exaggerated rates of return, while minimizing the risks associated with the investment.  For example, some of the agents told investors that they would receive returns on their investment, ranging from 15% to 200% on the Aegis units and 20% to 30% on the 7S units.  Some investors were also told by agents that these investments had virtually no risk because, among other things, the projects were already up and running and the wells were located in areas that have produced millions of barrels of oil.  14. After the initial phone contact with potential investors, sales agents would s would mation to the company so that a package of materials, including a private placement memorandum (PPM) could be mailed out to the investor.  The agents in access certain password-protected parts of the website, including access to the PPMs.  The PPMs for both offerings contained standard boilerplate cautionary language about the investment and  cured the misstatements and omissions that were made to investors.     B.  15. From approximately October 2012 through approximately January 2016, White managed a team of sales agents that solicited and raised money for the Aegis and 7S offerings.  approximately a dozen sales agents, with offices in several states including South Florida.  His agents used lead lists to solicit investors, but also had a list of -made clCase 0:18-cv-61870-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 4 of 10 5  investor his team brought on in the Aegis offering and a 28% to 35% commission for each investor in the 7S offering.   16. White also sales agents in various states.  White was the team leader for Aegis from about October 2012 until about March 2015 and for 7S from around mid-2015 until January 2016.  As team leader, White trained and instructed other sales agents about what to say to investors.  He would also help them close on sales calls with investors.  For this work as it relates to 7S, White was paid an additional 2% commission on all investor proceeds raised by his team.    17. Between October 2012 and July 2013, White received approximately $2.9 million in commission payments from the Aegis offerings.  In addition, between February 2013 and March 2015, he received approximately $3.94 million in commissions from Aegis through CC Excel Energy, LLC, a now defunct company that White controlled.  Once White received these commission payments from Aegis, he paid out a portion of it to his sales team. 18. Between July and October 2015, White received approximately $32,600 in commission payments from the 7S offering.  Additionally, between August 2015 and July 2016, he received $197,000 in commission payments from 7S through Conservative Surveyors, LLC, another company he controlled.  Once White received these commission payments from 7S, he paid out a portion of it to his sales team. C.  19. From at least February 2013 until about mid-2015, Vandivier managed a sales team that solicited investors for Aegis and 7S through his now defunct company, Aegis .  Vandivier hired and managed all of the sales people who worked for him, and trained sales agents on how to sell the investment opportunities.  Vandivier Case 0:18-cv-61870-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/13/2018   Page 5 of 10 6  oil leadknew about from his own client list.   20. Vandivier helped agents close on sales calls by speaking with investors directly and telling them about the Aegis and 7S investment opportunities.  Vandivier would also take clients to see the oil fields in Texas when they requested.

27,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA CASE NO. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, v. 1 GLOBAL CAPITAL LLC, and CARL RUDERMAN, Defendants, and 1 WEST CAPITAL LLC, BRIGHT SMILE FINANCING, LLC, BRR BLOCK INC., DIGI SOUTH LLC, GANADOR ENTERPRISES, LLC, MEDIA PAY LLC, PAY NOW DIRECT LLC, and RUDERMAN FAMILY TRUST, Relief Defendants. UNDER SEAL ,_ FILED BY 1.1!/ o v .c. AUG 2 3 2018 STEVEN M. LARIMORE CLERK US. DIST CT S.D. OF FlA. FT lAUD. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows: I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Commission brings this action as the result of a four-year-long unregistered securities offering fraud conducted by Defendant 1 Global Capital LLC, and overseen by Defendant Carl Ruderman, that victimized thousands of investors nationwide, many of whom used their retirement savings to invest. From no later than February 2014 until July 27, 2018, 1 Global (also referred to as ""the Company""), a private, South Florida firm, fraudulently raised more than $287 million from more than 3,400 investors to fund its business of offering short-term financing to small and medium-sized businesses. Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 1 of 34 2. 1 Global used a network of barred brokers, registered and unregistered investment advisers, and other sales agents -to whom they paid millions in commissions -to offer and sell unregistered securities to investors in no fewer than 25 states. The Company, through its marketing materials distributed to sales agents and the sales agents themselves, promised investors a high-return, low-risk investment in which 1 Global would use investor money to make short-term cash advances called Merchant Cash Advances (""MCAs"") to businesses that could not obtain more traditional financing such as bank loans. The Company touted a rigorous underwriting process through which it purportedly approved only one in ten merchants who applied for a loan, and an electronic collection process that would allow investors to make a profit. 3. In reality, the Company used substantial investor funds for purposes other than the cash advances, including paying operating expenses and purchasing already-distressed, term credit card debt. In addition, 1 Global and Ruderman misappropriated at least $35 million of investor money, at least $28 million of which was paid: (1) directly to Ruderman, Relief Defendant Ruderman Family Trust, and other entities he owned or controlled; (2) to companies owned or operated by Ruderman's relatives and acquaintances that had nothing to do with 1 Global's cash advance business; and (3) to fund Ruderman's lavish expenses such as a luxury vacation to Greece and monthly payments for his Mercedes Benz. 4. 1 Global and its sales representatives also made numerous other material misrepresentations and omissions to investors, including: (1) deceptively claiming the Company would only use investor money to fund MCAs; (2) falsely representing the amount of investor money the Company would take for its own use; (3) sending monthly account statements to investors that falsely represented their portfolio balances, rates of return, and the amount of their 2 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 2 of 34 cash 1 Global had in the bank to fund merchant loans; and ( 4) falsely representing the Company had an independent auditor that had endorsed certain aspects of the Company's business model. 5. Largely as a result of 1 Global and Ruderman's misappropriation and improper use of investor funds, by no later than October 2017 1 Global experienced a shortage of investor funds approximating $23 million that should have been in the Company's bank accounts and available for merchant loans. This shortfall continued and increased with time, so that by June 30, 2018, 1 Global's financial records showed approximately $50 million in missing investor funds. 6. Less than a month later, 1 Global and a sister company, Relief Defendant 1 West Capital LLC (which 1 Global used to make merchant loans in California), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, placing investors at risk of losing significant funds. An independent management team is now operating 1 Global and 1 West. 7. Ruderman founded 1 Global, was its chairman, and functioned for the entirety of its operations as its Chief Executive Officer. He maintained sole operational control over the Company, closely monitored its fundraising from investors and the merchant loan process, and made all key management decisions. Although Ruderman is no longer associated with 1 Global, he continues to control or have access to entities that received misappropriated investor funds from 1 Global. 8. Through their conduct, 1 Global and Ruderman violated Sections 5(a) and (c) and Section 17(a) ofthe Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and (c) and 77q(a), and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and 78o(a)(l) and 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5. Additionally, Ruderman aided and abetted 1 Global's violations of Section 1 O(b) and Rule 1 Ob-5 of the 3 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 3 of 34 Exchange Act. As 1 Global's control person, due to 1 Global violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, Ruderman also violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78t(a). The Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both Defendants, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest against the Relief Defendants. Simultaneously with filing this Complaint, the Commission also seeks emergency relief, including the appointment of a Receiver over certain Relief Defendants and an asset freeze against Ruderman and certain Relief Defendants. II. DEFENDANTS AND RELIEF DEFENDANTS A. Defendants 9. 1 Global is a Florida limited liability company headquartered in Hallandale Beach and formed in 2013. Corporate records show the Company is owned entirely by the Ruderman Family Trust. Until July 27, 2018, Ruderman was its Chairman and CEO. The Company had about 100 employees at the time it filed for bankruptcy. The Company never registered any of its securities with the Commission and did not have any publicly traded stock. 10. Ruderman, 77, is a resident of Aventura, Florida, and the sole owner of 1 Global through the Ruderman Family Trust. Until July 27, 2018, when he resigned from 1 Global, he was 1 Global's Chairman and CEO. He controlled all aspects of the Company's operations until he resigned. Ruderman continues to have ownership interests in Relief Defendants Bright Smile Financing, LLC, and Ganador Enterprises, LLC through Trusts that he controls. As part of the Commission's investigation into this matter, the staff subpoenaed Ruderman for sworn testimony, but he refused to appear. B. Relief Defendants 11. 1 West IS a Florida limited liability company formed m April 2014 and 4 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 4 of 34 headquartered at 1 Global's Hallandale Beach address. It is also owned by the Ruderman Family Trust. Corporate records list 1 Global's former operations manager as its manager. 1 West operated as 1 Global's agent in California to solicit and enter into contracts with merchants, and received approximately $50 million in investor funds from 1 Global. 1 West also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 27, 2018, and is now under the control of the same independent management as 1 Global. 12. Bright Smile Financing is a Florida limited liability company formed in March 2017. Bright Smile Financing loans individuals money to finance cosmetic or dental procedures. Corporate records show Bright Smile Financing used the same address as 1 Global and is 100% owned by Ruderman through the Bright Smile Trust, that Ruderman controls. Up until a few days ago, Bright Smile Financing used 1 Global's former operations manager as its manager. From May 16, 2017 through June 2018, Bright Smile Financing received approximately $15.3 million in investor funds from 1 Global at Ruderman's direction for no consideration or legitimate services. 13. Ganador Enterprises is a Florida limited liability company formed on March 3, 2016. Corporate records show the Ruderman Family Trust owns 50% of Ganador, with two other individuals who are unrelated to 1 Global owning the other 50%. Ganador lists 1 Global's former chief operating officer and Ruderman's brother-in-law as its manager. Ganador makes individual consumer loans, including payday loans. Ganador uses the same address as 1 Global. From April 28, 2016 through June 2018, Ganador received approximately $5.6 million in investor funds from 1 Global at Ruderman's direction for no consideration or legitimate services. 14. BRR Block Inc. is a Florida corporation based in Boca Raton and incorporated in January 2018. Corporate records show one of Ruderman's sons is BRR Block's sole officer and 5 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 5 of 34 director. Its business is purportedly related to blockchain technology. In January 16 2018, BRR Block received at least $1 million in investor funds from 1 Global for no consideration or legitimate services. 15. Digi South, LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in November 2012. Digi South is owned by the Ruderman Family Trust and uses the same address as 1 Global. Corporate records show that until 2017, its manager was Ruderman's sister-in-law. Since 2017, the company has listed 1 Global's former operations manager as its manager. Among other things, Digi South used to own Playgirl and other adult magazines. Through April 2018, Digi South received approximately $805,000 in investor funds from 1 Global for no consideration or legitimate services. 16. Media Pay LLC is a Florida limited liability company based in North Miami, Florida and formed in January 2015 and administratively dissolved in September 2016. Corporate records show its manager is Ruderman's sister-in-law. Through April 2018, Media Pay received approximately $647,000 in investor funds from 1 Global for no consideration or legitimate services. 17. Pay Now Direct LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in April 2015 that was administratively dissolved in September 2017. The entity listed 1 Global's former operations manager as its manager. Pay Now Direct is an entity Ruderman uses to pay his expenses, and it uses the same address as 1 Global. Through June 2018, Pay Now Direct received approximately $5.3 million in investor funds from 1 Global and the Ruderman Family Trust for no consideration or legitimate services. 18. The Ruderman Family Trust is a Florida trust instrument dated June 2, 2014, created to administer certain Ruderman assets. Ruderman is the grantor, his brother-in-law is the 6 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 6 of 34 trustee, and Ruderman's wife and children are the beneficiaries. Through April 2018, the Trust received approximately $4 million in investor funds from 1 Global for no consideration or legitimate services. III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 19. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b ), 20( d), and 22(a) ofthe Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a), and Sections 21(d), 2l(e), and 27 ofthe Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa. 20. This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants and Relief Defendants and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida as Ruderman resides in the District and 1 Global and all of the Relief Defendants used addresses in this District and conducted their business in this District. In particular, 1 Global's operations were located in the Southern District, and Ruderman and other Company officers conducted, supervised, and managed all aspects of 1 Global's fundraising and MCA business at 1 Global's Hallandale Beach headquarters. 21. The Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint. IV. 1 GLOBAL'S MERCHANT CASH ADVANCE BUSINESS 22. Ruderman founded 1 Global in 2013, purportedly seeking ""a better growth opportunity for his family's funds."" By 2018, the Company had grown to more than 100 employees in sales, underwriting, collections, finance, technology and lawyers. 23. Ruderman was a hands-on Chairman and CEO, personally overseeing all aspects of the Company's operations. There was no board of directors or any other high-level executive 7 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 7 of 34 with decision-making authority. Ruderman knew at all times how much 1 Global had raised from investors and received a daily report showing how many cash advance transactions the Company had funded. Ruderman signed 1 Global's agreements with third-party sales agents to allow them to offer and sell 1 Global's unregistered securities. He thus was responsible for the terms of those agreements, which specified the sales agents' compensation and required 1 Global to approve all marketing materials and sales brochures the agents used. 24. Ruderman also personally directed or approved all of the Company's maJOr transactions, including an approximate $40 million loan to a California automotive firm and the $50 million purchase of distressed credit card debt, the latter of which was not an allowed use of investor funds. He carefully monitored account statements the Company sent to investors each month, approved sending them, and knew they contained false statements about the value of investors' portfolios and rates of return. He directed bad debt reserve amounts, ordered investor funds sent to himself and companies his family owned, and told one employee who questioned those transactions it was his company and he could do what he wanted with investor money. 25. In fact, Ruderman was so involved in the Company that he bragged in an email to an executive of a hedge fund that gave 1 Global a line of credit in 2016 ""I'm personally on top of all operations from Sam thru 6:30pm everyday!"" 26. Until it ceased operations on July 27, 2018, 1 Global was in the business of funding MCAs -short-term loans to small and medium-sized businesses. According to its marketing materials and website, 1 Global provided these businesses with an alternative source of funding to traditional bank loans and other financing methods, which it touted as insufficient to meet the short-term needs of smaller businesses. 27. 1 Global contracted with 100 to 200 third-party vendors to find merchants 8 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 8 of 34 interested in applying for cash advances. 1 Global paid those companies a finder's fee for each merchant who received a cash advance. The amount of each finder's fee varied, depending on the loan amount, the third party's track record with 1 Global, and other factors. 1 Global determined the amount of the finder's fee in each instance. Through April 2018, 1 Global paid third parties who solicited merchants approximately $15 million in finder's fees for their efforts. 28. Once a finder located an interested merchant, the merchant would apply directly to 1 Global for a cash advance. In marketing materials 1 Global sent to sales agents to use in soliciting investors, 1 Global touted a comprehensive underwriting process and stressed that it only approved loans to one out of every ten merchants who applied. 29. The Company indicated in its marketing materials that it used a variety of methods to weed out risky loan candidates, including internet research, credit checks, specific programs for background checks and business analysis, a review of bank records and other documents, and, most importantly, personal contact with every merchant before the Company made an advance. 30. The Company's materials also reported that 1 Global's MCAs were typically small, averaging $68,000. The typical repayment term was anywhere from four months to one year. The MCAs were purportedly made against a business' future cash receivables, and merchants agreed to make daily payments via electronic (ACH) debiting from their business operating bank accounts as they received payments from their customers or vendors. 31. 1 Global's materials also touted a consistently low default rate, specifically stating that its average annual loan write-off rate was only 4%. In addition, the Company told investors and others that approximately 30% of the merchants it loaned money to refinanced their loans. 32. In reality, the Company's MCA process was not nearly so rigorous and its cash 9 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 9 of 34 advance business functioned much differently. In contrast to its claim that its average loan amount was $68,000, 1 Global often made loans of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. In one instance, 1 Global made an MCA of approximately $40 million to a single California automobile dealership-a transaction Ruderman personally directed. 33. The Company also had far more difficulty collecting from merchants than it publicly disclosed. For example, in 2016, 210 of the approximately 1,166 MCAs 1 Global funded, a total of 18%, were the subject of collection lawsuits. In 2017, 328 of 1 Global's 2,092 MCAs, a total of 15%, were the subject of collection lawsuits. 34. Additionally, the Company's website told a far different story than the thorough underwriting process 1 Global touted to investors and elsewhere. The website stressed how simple and quick it was for merchants to obtain loans, noting that the MCAs were unsecured business cash advances. The website consistently promised merchants they could execute an MCA and ""have your money in as little as 24 hours."" 35. The website also promised merchants that ""If you own a business and need cash fast, we're the company to call,"" going on to promise ""We can provide the money you need without the hassles and hoops other financial institutions put you through ... You do not have to come to us hat in hand with scads of paperwork proving your credit worthiness only to have your application denied. We fund 90% of the businesses that apply without basing it on their credit scores ... We have the resources and the commitment to get you that unsecured advancement you need immediately."" Emphasis added. 36. Through April 2018, 1 Global and 1 West made about $348 million in merchant cash advances involving approximately 4,000 MCAs. As of that same date, merchants had repaid approximately $241 million of that amount. As of April2018, due to collectability issues 10 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 10 of 34 and the Defendants' misappropriation of investor funds, 1 Global owes investors at least $272 million but only had $27.5 million in its bank accounts. 1 Global does not currently have enough funds to repay investors and filed for bankruptcy in July 2018. V. 1 GLOBAL'S SOLICITATION OF INVESTOR FUNDS A. The Network Of Sales Agents 37. 1 Global funded its MCA business and its operations almost entirely with money from investors, whom the Company referred to alternately as ""Lenders"" or ""Syndicate Partners."" The only non-investor source of funds for 1 Global came from a $10 million line of credit the Company obtained from a hedge fund in 2016, from which it drew down $9.5 million over several months in 2016 and 2017 to make MCAs at the direction of the hedge fund. The remainder of 1 Global's MCA business derived entirely from investors' contributions. 38. 1 Global found its investors through a second network of sales agents consisting in large part of registered and unregistered investment advisers and former (and in some cases barred) brokers. The Company had dozens of sales agents, to whom it paid commissions usually ranging from .75% to 3% of the amount of investor funds they brought to 1 Global. 39. For example, many sales agents received 3% of every new investment amount they brought in to the Company. If the investment rolled over into another term, most sales agents received an additional .75%. In addition, some sales agents who brought other sales agents into the Company received an additional .75% of every amount their recruited sales agents sold. Through April 2018, 1 Global paid sales agents nearly $9 million in commissions for getting investors to put money into 1 Global. 40. Sales agents signed an Affiliate Agreement with 1 Global outlining their rights and responsibilities in, and compensation for, selling the 1 Global investment. Ruderman signed at least two of these Affiliate Agreements on behalf of the Company, allowing sales agents to 11 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 11 of 34 market the 1 Global investment. The Agreements specified that 1 Global had to provide or approve all marketing materials the sales agents provided to prospective investors. In the Agreements and in meetings and telephone calls, 1 Global stressed that its minimum investment amount was $25,000, and that the investment opportunity was for a limited number of sophisticated investors. 41. In practice, however, 1 Global placed no restrictions on who sales agents could solicit to invest in the Company, and frequently waived the $25,000 minimum investment requirement. Sales agents regularly solicited large numbers of their existing clients to invest. In short, the Company accepted money from any and all investors the sales agents could find. As 1 Global's owner, Chairman, and CEO, Ruderman substantially participated in the offer and sale of 1 Global's unregistered securities to the investing public and paying transaction-based compensation to the sales agents by: (1) hiring sales agents; (2) attending due diligence meetings with sales agents; (3) executing at least two Affiliate Agreements; and (4) directing 1 Global to pay the sales agents' commissions. 42. From February 2014 through April 2018, 1 Global received at least $287 million from 3,400 investors located in at least 25 states, with at least 100 investors each located in California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Tennessee. More than one-third of the money came from those who invested through IRAs. In the months after April 2018, 1 Global continued to receive millions of dollars from investors. The funds 1 Global raised were commingled or pooled together into one or more of 1 Global's bank accounts. B. 1 Global's Sales And Marketing Efforts 43. 1 Global regularly provided sales materials to its agents for use in marketing the investment. Those materials included a list of Frequently Asked Questions, a history of the 12 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 12 of 34 Company, and a description of both the MCA program and the investment process. Sales agents used the materials in soliciting clients to invest, attaching them to emails in at least one case and other times using the information in them when they spoke to prospective investors. 44. The marketing materials contained the statements about the purportedly rigorous MCA loan approval and repayment process described earlier in this Complaint. In addition, the marketing materials consistently touted 1 Global's alleged consistently high returns for investors. The Frequently Asked Questions claimed 1 Global investors had averaged ""high single digit"" and ""low double digit"" annual returns. 45. In addition, 1 Global sent copies of actual monthly investor account statements to sales agents to show investors. Those account statements showed returns ranging from 8% to 17% a year. Starting in January 2018, 1 Global changed its marketing materials to tell investors that they would earn a guaranteed minimum of 3% a year, with the possibility of much higher returns. 46. The marketing materials, including the Frequently Asked Questions, also stated that 1 Global collected an average of $1.30 to $1.35 or $1.40 on each dollar it advanced in an MCA. This was the means by which 1 Global and investors both purportedly made a profit. 47. Using this information, sales agents usually told investors 1 Global could earn them high single digit to low double digit returns a year, and at least one sales agent created his own promotional flyer based on the Company's information emphasizing these returns. Both the Company and sales agents stressed that 1 Global offered better returns than fixed instruments such as annuities, and was a safe, short-term alternative to more risky stock market investments. 48. Both sales agents and investors were attracted by these allegedly high profits, with many investors deciding to send money on the basis of them. For example, based on the 13 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 13 of 34 promised high returns, one investor gave almost $1 million from a 401 K retirement plan to 1 Global for MCAs. Another investor invested $135,000 after his sales agent showed him one of the sample client statements that reflected double digit annual returns. That same investor sent in another approximately $150,000 in the ensuing months based on receiving his own monthly account statements showing annual returns of at least 8%. Still another investor contributed approximately 20% of her net worth in two investments in September 2017 and May 2018 based on the promised high rates of return and the profits being shown on her monthly account statements. 49. Although 1 Global told sales agents and investors that it was not selling securities because the notes it gave to investors were allegedly only for nine months, at least one early version of the Company's marketing materials called the opportunity to put money into 1 Global an investment. The cover read ""Putting cash to work for merchants while earning high returns on your investment."" Many investors wrote the word ""investment"" in the memo line of their checks, and 1 Global's marketing materials touted the Company as an investment alternative to annuities and stocks. At least one sales agent repeatedly told clients in emails that he was offering them an investment in 1 Global. C. The Memorandum Of Indebtedness 50. For the vast majority of the four-plus years 1 Global offered and sold its investment, it used an instrument entitled a Memorandum of Indebtedness (""MOl"") as the note or contract between the Company and investors. 51. The MOl termed the investor a ""Lender,"" and identified the Company as the ""Borrower."" The MOl specifically stated that an investor was providing money to 1 Global so the Company could expand its business activities, which it termed the ""Covered Activities."" The 14 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 14 of 34 only specific Covered Activity identified in the MOl was the MCAs. And the only use of investor money the Company identified in its marketing materials was the MCAs. After 1 Global received investor funds, it pooled and commingled them together in non-segregated 1 Global bank accounts. 52. While the MOl stated that it was a nine-month note, for most of the time 1 Global raised money from investors, the MOl also stated the note would automatically roll over into a new nine-month term unless the investor expressly informed the Company in writing at least 30 days before the end of the nine months that he or she did not want the note to roll over. 53. For a brief period in early 2018, 1 Global changed the MOl to provide that the note would mature after nine months unless an investor specifically informed the Company that he or she wanted to renew the investment. However, 1 Global reinstated the automatic rollover provision about two months later as a result of the ""paperwork nightmare"" the revised opt-in procedure was causing. 54. In fact, the overwhelming majority of investors allowed their investments to automatically roll over. One sales agent estimated only six to eight of the hundreds of investors he solicited redeemed their investments after nine months. Company bank records show that as of April 30, 2018, investors had sent more than $287 million to 1 Global, but 1 Global had returned only about $16 million of those funds through redemptions or other payments. 55. Even if an investor redeemed his or her investment after nine months, the note extended beyond nine months because it took 1 Global several months to fully pay out an investor's principal and interest. 1 Global called this period ""the unwinding"" and ""the grace period"" in the MOis. 56. The unwinding period was caused by the way 1 Global used investor money to 15 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 15 of 34 fund MCAs. Rather than use investor funds on a single MCA or a small number of MCAs, the Company gave each investor a small, fractionalized interest in up to hundreds of MCAs. A Company computer system would assign the investor's funds automatically, based on the amount of MCAs that came in daily in the weeks following an investment. Under this system, one MCA would be funded with dozens or even hundreds of investors' funds pooled together. 57. Using this process often resulted in the Company taking months to place all of an investor's funds into MCAs. Thus, if an investor elected to redeem his or her investment after nine months, it could take months after that for the merchants who received the investor's money to fully repay the MCAs. Often the Company would not generate enough money from the MCAs to fully pay redeeming investors, forcing the Company to use new investor funds to pay off redeeming investors. 58. 1 Global did not pay investors the interest or the increase in valuation of their portfolio the Company told them they were earning until the investor cashed out some or all of their investment. Although 1 Global sent investors monthly account statements purporting to show each investor's account credited with the interest the investor had earned on MCA repayments, investors did not receive those payments right away. Rather, 1 Global simply commingled all those investor funds into its various bank accounts and frequently reinvested the investor money into new MCAs. This also allowed 1 Global to misappropriate investor funds. 59. 1 Global eventually memorialized the unwinding period into specific timetables at the beginning of 2018. It informed investors through marketing materials sent to sales agents that if an investor who redeemed had placed less than $250,000 with 1 Global, he or she would be fully repaid in 12 months, three months after the end of the nine-month term. For investments of greater than $250,000, the repayment would take six additional months, making the MOl a 15-16 Case 0:18-cv-61991-BB   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/23/2018   Page 16 of 34 month note. 60. Another key provision of the MOl provided that it was within 1 Global's sole discretion how to use investor money to make MCA loans. In fact, investors had no say in how 1 Global used their money. Investors could not and did not manage their MCA loan portfolios; it was solely up to 1 Global whether and when to use an investor's money to fund MCAs and which MCAs to fund. The success of the investment and whether an investor earned profits was solely dependent on 1 Global's decisions on MCA funding and other uses of funds, as well as repayment and collection efforts. 61. The MOl contained a paragraph stating the investor was sophisticated and was ""qualified,"" meaning he or she had a certain income level or net worth. However, 1 Global never enforced this provision, did not restrict who sales agents could offer the investments to, and accepted investments from anyone who wanted to invest, regardless of their net worth, income, or sophistication. 62. Finally, the MOl disclosed 1 Global would charge investors in two ways. The first was a 13% management fee that 1 Global would take from the amount collected from MCA repayments. The second way 1 Global said it would charge investors was to have them reimburse the Company the finders' fees it paid to third parties for finding merchants to take MCAs. The MOl contained only those two ways 1 Global could charge investors. However, in truth 1 Global took far greater amounts from investor funds to pay its operating expenses, and for its","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 1 Global Capital LLC and its former chief executive officer for allegedly defrauding at least 3,400 retail investors, more than one-third of whom invested their retirement funds. The Florida-based cash advance company and former CEO Carl Ruderman allegedly fraudulently raised more than $287 million since 2014 in unregistered securities sold through a network that included barred brokers.On August 23, 2018, the Honorable Judge Beth Bloom of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze against Ruderman and other Ruderman companies charged by the SEC as relief defendants. The Court also granted the SEC's request to appoint a receiver over certain of the relief defendants - Bright Smile Financing, LLC, BRR Block, Inc., Digi South, LLC, Ganador Enterprises, LLC, Media Pay LLC, and Pay Now Direct LLC. The Court scheduled a hearing for September 7, 2018, for Ruderman and the relief defendants to show cause, if any, why the asset freeze Order should not continue for the pendency of the litigation or until otherwise ordered by the Court.According to the SEC's complaint unsealed yesterday, although investors were promised profits from 1 Global's loans to small and mid-sized companies, a large portion of their money went to Ruderman's lavish personal spending and to his consumer-loan companies, Bright Smile Financing LLC and Ganador Enterprises LLC, which had nothing to do with 1 Global's cash advance business. Investors in 1 Global allegedly were given bogus account statements and were falsely told that it had an independent auditor, and that its secured loans, typically for small amounts, had low default rates. According to the complaint, in contrast to what it told investors, 1 Global marketed itself to business borrowers as a low-hassle way to access cash quickly, often made large, unsecured loans, and had significant problems with collections. 1 Global declared bankruptcy in July and Ruderman resigned from the company.The SEC's complaint charges 1 Global and Ruderman with violations of Sections 5(a), (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Action of 1934 (""Exchange Act""). Additionally, the complaint charges Ruderman with aiding and abetting 1 Global's violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and with violating Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest from the defendants and relief defendants, and financial penalties against the defendants.The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Gary Miller and Mark Dee in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Elisha L. Frank and Fernando Torres. The SEC's litigation is being led by Christopher Martin and Robert K. Levenson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the Colorado Division of Securities.The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and confirm their identity."

LONG,  Defendant.   Case No.     COMPLAINT     Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges: SUMMARY  1. This action involves insider trading by Bryan B. Long (ﬁLongﬂ), who in May 2015 learned confidential information while employed at eBay, Inc. (ﬁeBayﬂ) that eBay™s subsidiary at the time, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (ﬁPayPalﬂ), was Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 1 of 12     - 2 -   COMPLAINT     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  planning to acquire Xoom Corporation (ﬁXoomﬂ).  In May and June 2015, Long bought speculative call options on Xoom stock based on material nonpublic information about the planned acquisition that he misappropriated from his employer, in advance of the announcement of the deal.  At the time of Long™s trades, he was eBay™s Director of SEC Reporting.   2. Long first purchased over $10,500 of Xoom call options on May 20, 2015, within five days of PayPal making its initial offer to acquire Xoom.  Then, after learning that the deal could be announced in early July, Long made a second purchase of another $5,000 of Xoom call options on June 22, 2015, which were set to expire less than thirty days after his purchase.  These were Long™s first-ever purchases of any securities of Xoom.  After the market closed on July 1, 2015, PayPal™s acquisition of Xoom was made public.  The next morning, Xoom stock opened trading at $25.50 per share, a 52-week high, and Long sold all of his Xoom options, reaping almost $36,000 in illegal insider trading profits. 3. Long violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.  4. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-1.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa. 6. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21A, and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d), 78u-1, and 78aa.

On October 7, 2013, Long joined eBay as its Director of SEC Reporting and a member of the company™s chief accounting organization, also known as the ﬁControllership Team.ﬂ  Long™s primary responsibility was preparing all the SEC filings of eBay and its subsidiary, PayPal.  12. Long™s employment at eBay prohibited him from using the material nonpublic information he obtained in the course of his employment to trade securities.  Long™s offer letter, which he signed in September 2013, included the following language:   All employees are subject to eBay™s Insider Trading Agreement, which outlines the procedures and guidelines governing securities trades by company personnel.  Enclosed is a copy of eBay™s Insider Trading Agreement.  Please review the Agreement carefully, execute the certification and submit it to eBay™s human resources department. 13.

Long completed his annual training on eBay™s Code of Business Conduct on June 10, 2015.   16. Long received ﬁSEC Refresherﬂ training while attending an offsite meeting of the newly-formed team that would comprise PayPal™s Controllership group from June 16-18, 2015.  The ﬁSEC Refresherﬂ included a segment in insider trading. B. Long™s Insider Trading in Xoom Securities  17. Long, in the course of his employment at eBay, obtained and traded based on material nonpublic information about PayPal™s impending acquisition of Xoom in the weeks leading up to the deal™s public announcement on July 1, 2015.   1. April 2015 and PayPal™s Approach of Xoom 18. On April 3, 2015, a senior executive at PayPal contacted Xoom™s chief executive officer to express interest in discussing a partnership with Xoom.  On April 10, PayPal representatives met with Xoom™s senior management and investment banking representatives to gain a better understanding of Xoom™s business.   19. On April 17, 2015, PayPal and Xoom signed a non-disclosure agreement as to PayPal™s intention to acquire Xoom.  About a week later, eBay and Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 5 of 12     - 6 -   COMPLAINT     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  PayPal employees began the financial and accounting review of Xoom and the potential transaction.     20. In or around late April 2015, PayPal signed a letter of intent with Xoom, and retained financial and legal advisors. 21. As eBay™s Director of SEC Reporting and a member of eBay™s Controllership Team, Long had frequent interaction with eBay and PayPal employees who were working on the Xoom acquisition. 22. By late April 2015, several members of the Controllership Team, including Long™s supervisor, who was eBay™s Chief Accounting Officer (ﬁeBay CAOﬂ), and eBay™s Director of M&A Diligence and Accounting, knew of PayPal™s efforts to acquire Xoom.   2. Long Buys Xoom Call Options in May 2015 23. In or around the spring of 2015, Long was working on a project whereby eBay would spin off PayPal into a separate legal entity that would be a publicly traded company.  As Director of SEC reporting, Long headed up the effort to prepare an amendment to PayPal™s Form 10 that had been filed with the SEC registering PayPal™s securities for public trading. 24. In connection with this project, the eBay CAO, who was aware of the potential Xoom acquisition, had ongoing discussions with his staff, including Long, to keep them apprised of major developments in the business so that they could perform their jobs.  The eBay CAO communicated information about the potential acquisitions, including the Xoom acquisition, and other transactions that his staff needed to know in order to ensure that PayPal and eBay met their disclosure obligations including disclosures made in PayPal™s Form 10.   25. On May 5, 2015, members of the eBay Controllership Team, including Long, met to discuss amendments to PayPal™s Form 10.   26. On May 6, 2015, Long logged into his online brokerage account via his eBay-issued laptop.  Long had not logged into this account in approximately nine months.   Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 6 of 12     - 7 -   COMPLAINT     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  27. During the next 60 days, while trading in Xoom securities, Long logged into this account 436 times.     28. The following day, May 7, 2015, Long sent an email introducing himself to PayPal™s Director of Finance, who worked on PayPal merger and acquisition activities, and who was specifically working on PayPal™s effort to acquire Xoom.  Long™s email stated, in part:  ﬁI figured I would reach out to you in your new M&A role with PayPal.ﬂ  Long requested a meeting with the PayPal Director of Finance to discuss GAAP-related issues arising out of PayPal™s mergers and acquisitions activity.   29. On May 13, 2015, Long wired $10,000 from his savings account to his online brokerage account, which had an existing balance of only $644. 30. On May 15, 2015, PayPal made its initial offer to Xoom to acquire the company for between $21 and $22.50 per share. 31. Before arriving at work on May 20, 2015, Long paid a total of $10,527 to purchase sixty contracts for Xoom call options through his online brokerage account.  32. A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the company™s stock at a set price (the ﬁstrike priceﬂ) for a certain period of time (through ﬁexpiration,ﬂ which occurs on the third Friday of the specified month).  Generally, the buyer of a call option anticipates the stock price will increase during the specified amount of time.  If the call option™s strike price is above the price at which the stock is then trading, the call option is considered to be ﬁout-of-the-moneyﬂ because it would be unprofitable to exercise the call and pay more for the stock than if it were purchased on a stock market.   33. The chart below lists the number of options contracts that Long purchased in each series and depicts Long™s trades as a percentage of total volume traded in those particular options series on that day: Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 7 of 12     - 8 -   COMPLAINT     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  QUANTITY OPTIONS SERIES % OF DAY™S TRADING VOLUME  20 July 17.50 calls 100 20 July 20 calls 95 10 October 17.50 calls 100 10 October 20 calls 67  34. In the chart, for example, each of the July 20 call options gave Long the right to purchase 100 shares of Xoom stock at a price of $20.00 per share, from the date of purchase through the third Friday in July, when the option expired. 35. On the date that Long made these purchases, Xoom™s common stock was trading at about $19 per share.   36. Long™s purchase of Xoom call options were his first self-directed purchases of any security in 16 months, and his very first trades in Xoom securities. 37. On May 21, 2015, Xoom rejected PayPal™s initial offer, and on May 27, PayPal made a revised offer of $25 per share.   3. After Learning More Information About the Timing of the Deal, Long Buys More Xoom Call Options in June 2015 38. On June 2, 2015, PayPal and Xoom entered into an exclusivity agreement, and PayPal conducted confirmatory due diligence through the end of June 2015.   39. In early June 2015, Long continued to communicate with the PayPal Director of Finance about potential SEC reporting issues associated with PayPal™s mergers and acquisitions activity.  As part of these discussions, on June 3, 2015, Long emailed slides to PayPal™s Director of Finance ﬁto help facilitate some of the thoughts I wanted to convey related to some acquisition-related considerations from an SEC perspective.ﬂ  Long also stated:  ﬁit was good to talk the other day about some SEC considerations around acquisitions and to begin the brainstorming Case 3:18-cv-05973   Document 1   Filed 09/28/18   Page 8 of 12     - 9 -   COMPLAINT     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  around how you and I stay coordinated going forward.ﬂ  That same day, PayPal™s Director of Finance replied, ﬁthis is helpful and highlights the need for you and I to stay connected on any large deals . . . we should meet monthly or so to check in on deal pipeline and any potential changes in rules.ﬂ 40. On June 5, 2015, Long wired $5,000 from his savings account to his online brokerage account. 41. On June 16, 2015, PayPal™s Director of Finance emailed Long seeking his advice and providing a ﬁquick update on target as discussed.ﬂ  Although the email did not list Xoom by name, it listed the company™s annual revenue, net income, and net assets.  PayPal™s Director of Finance closed the email by stating, ﬁLet me know if you need any additional info.ﬂ   42. On June 22, 2015, Long emailed PayPal™s Director of Finance asking him to provide the target™s ﬁpretax income for 2014 (full year), and . . . total assets as of 12/31/2014 (assuming the target is a calendar year company).ﬂ 43. On June 22, 2015, in response to Long™s request, PayPal™s Director of Finance emailed to Long the ﬁtarget™sﬂ pretax income and total assets.  Long replied, and asked about the ﬁexpected timing for the announcement.ﬂ  Later that same day, after the market had closed, Long received a reply informing him that the deal could be announced in ﬁearly July.ﬂ    44. Early the next day, on June 23, 2015, between 6:44 a.m. and 7:05 a.m. (PT), Long bought another 40 Xoom call option contracts, at a cost of $5,101, through his online brokerage account as follows: QUANTITY OPTIONS SERIES % OF DAY™S TRADING VOLUME  10 July 20 calls 50 30 July 22.50 calls 75  45. Xoom™s common stock traded at around $22.34 per share when Long made these purchases.

Long Reaps his Ill-gotten Profits After Xoom Announces the Acquisition in July 2015 46. On July 1, 2015, Xoom stock ended the trading day at $20.70 per share.  Five minutes after the close of the market, Xoom and PayPal jointly announced that Xoom had agreed to be acquired by PayPal for $25 per share, or $890 million net of cash.  This was PayPal™s largest acquisition to date.   47. The next day, July 2, 2015, Xoom stock opened at $25.50 per share, which was a 52-week high and an increase of over 20% from the previous day™s closing price.  In addition, the volume of trading in Xoom shares was 30 times higher than the prior day.   48. Between 6:40 a.m. and 7:01 a.m. (PT), Long sold all of his Xoom call options through his online brokerage account for $51,471, netting a profit of approximately $35,842.  49.

Long, a CPA who was employed as eBay's Director of SEC Reporting, obtained material non-public information about PayPal's impending acquisition of Xoom in the course of his work preparing PayPal's SEC filings. According to the complaint, Long purchased Xoom call options in late May 2015 shortly after PayPal made its initial acquisition offer. Approximately one month later, after learning that the deal was moving forward and could be announced in ""early July,"" Long allegedly engaged in a second round of illegal trades, purchasing additional Xoom call options that were due to expire in less than a month. As alleged in the complaint, Long reaped almost $36,000 in ill-gotten gains by selling all of the options after PayPal announced it was acquiring Xoom on July 1, 2015.The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Northern District of California, charges Long with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, pre-judgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Diana K. Tani and Paul E. Kim of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit with the assistance of John S. Rymas in the unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by John B. Bulgozdy and Amy Longo of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."

Craig misrepresented that the investor's funds would remain in escrow and be used only for the purpose of obtaining a ""proof of funds"" to purchase a condominium property known as the Heritage Condominiums in Atlanta, Georgia. Craig also misrepresented that, after the property was purchased, the investor would receive a return of the principal plus a profit of approximately 30% in a short period of time. Despite these promises, Craig almost immediately transferred these funds to bank accounts that he controlled or to third parties. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Craig encouraged the investor to take out loans to further fund the investment, misrepresenting that Craig would make payments on the loans with his own funds until the real estate transaction closed. Instead, Craig allegedly used the investor's escrowed funds to make the payments.The SEC further alleges that Craig and OneStep engaged in a similar scheme in late 2017. In this scheme, Craig and OneStep defrauded at least five investors, who were told that their funds were being used for a real estate development project, of $460,000 by guaranteeing high profits and then misappropriating the funds for other purposes.The SEC's complaint charges Craig and OneStep with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks a judgment against the defendants providing for permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names Peter Baker, Elizabeth Oharriz, Prestige Global Trading, Ltd., and Diversified Initiatives Consulting & Logistics, Inc. as relief defendants, seeking disgorgement with prejudgment interest against them.The SEC's investigation is led by Christina McGill and Matthew B. Reisig, with assistance from Richard G. Lill, and is supervised by Timothy England and Melissa Hodgman. The litigation will be led by Melissa Armstrong."

NEVADA SPORTS INVESTMENT GROUP, LP   Defendant.  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   JURY DEMAND       1 1. This action alleges violations of the registration requirements of 2 Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. 3 § 77e(a) and 77e(c)] by Defendant Nevada Sports Investment Group, LP 4 (ﬁNevada Sportsﬂ).  Nevada Sports offered and sold unregistered investment 5 Case 2:18-cv-01726   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 1 of 9  2 contracts that did not qualify for any exemptions in violation of Sections 5(a) and 1 5(c) of the Securities Act. 2 SUMMARY 3 2. In 2015, the Nevada legislature enacted Senate Bill 443 (ﬁNVSB 4 443ﬂ), allowing entities that fulfilled requirements specified in the bill to collect 5 funds from individuals anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, wager 6 those funds on sporting events, and share the wagering profits with the 7 individuals who contributed the funds. 8 3. Such entities, sometimes known as ﬁsports betting funds,ﬂ were 9 described by some (including Nevada Sports) as functioning like mutual funds. 10 4. Pursuant to NVSB 443, each sports betting fund must keep a Nevada 11 bank account in which it aggregates the funds raised from individuals, which are 12 then used to wager on sporting events. 13 5. Nevada Sports retained a percentage of any profit generated as a fee.  14 After that fee was subtracted, Nevada Sports divided the remaining profit pro 15 rata among all the individuals that contributed funds (ﬁClientsﬂ).  Thus, as profits 16 increased or decreased, the fortunes of the Clients and Nevada Sports rose or fell 17 together. 18 6. Nevada Sports had an individual who, working alone, decided how 19 the funds would be wagered on sporting events. 20 Case 2:18-cv-01726   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 2 of 9  3 7. Nevada Sports did not file a registration statement complying with 1 Section 5 of the Securities Act in support of its sports betting fund, and did not 2 fulfill the requirements necessary to qualify for an exemption from registration. 3 8. By virtue of this conduct, Nevada Sports has violated and, unless 4 enjoined, will continue to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. 5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6 9. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and 7 (d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)-(d)] to enjoin  Nevada Sports from 8 engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this 9 Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar 10 purport and object, and for other relief. 11 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 12 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)]. 13 11. Nevada Sports, directly and indirectly, has made use of the mails, the 14 means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and the means and 15 instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, in 16 connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged 17 in this Complaint.  18 12. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act 19 [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and 20 Case 2:18-cv-01726   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 3 of 9  4 courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act have occurred 1 within the District of Nevada.  Nevada Sports maintains its principal place of 2 business in Las Vegas and the securities have been sold to investors in this 3 district. 4 DEFENDANT 5 13.

NVSB 443 also allows sports betting funds to share the profits of such 16 wagering with the individuals from whom they have collected money.    17 16. NVSB 443 requires sports betting funds, among other things, to be 18 organized in Nevada and to maintain Clients™ funds in an account at a Nevada 19 bank. 20 Case 2:18-cv-01726   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 4 of 9  5 Nevada Sports Investment Group, LP 1 17.

As required by NVSB 443, all Client funds were pooled in a 5 Nevada bank account opened by Nevada Sports for its sports betting fund. 6 19.

As a limited partnership, Nevada Sports was controlled and operated 1 by its general partner.  Nevada Sports™ general partner, working alone, decided 2 how the funds would be wagered on sporting events.  None of Nevada Sports™ 3 Clients played any role whatsoever in the profit-generating process of placing 4 wagers. 5 24. During its period of operation, Nevada Sports raised approximately 6 $1,035,000 for wagering from approximately 35 Clients located in at least 20 7 states. 8 25. Nevada Sports™ Clients used U.S. mail and electronic bank transfers 9 when submitting their funds. 10 26. Nevada Sports did not make a determination regarding its Clients™ 11 status as accredited investors as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(15)(ii) of the 12 Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(15)(ii)]. 13 27. Prior to accepting funds, Nevada Sports did not file a registration 14 statement complying with Section 5 of the Securities Act in support of its sports 15 betting fund, and did not fulfill the requirements necessary to qualify for an 16 exemption from registration. 17 Case 2:18-cv-01726   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 6 of 9  7 COUNT I Š UNREGISTERED OFFERING OF SECURITIES 1 Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act 2 [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)] 3 28.

Nevada Sports was one of a number of organizations formed pursuant to a 2015 Nevada state law that, for the first time, allowed Nevada-based entities to collect and pool money from investors anywhere in the world for purposes of sports wagering. Entities like Nevada Sports promoted their investment opportunities as functioning like mutual funds.According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of Nevada, in 2015 Nevada passed a law allowing entities to solicit and collect funds from individual investors anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, place wagers on certain sporting events, and split the wagering profits among the investors. From 2015 through 2017, Nevada Sports raised over $1 million from more than 30 investors. Nevada Sports conducted a general solicitation by widely offering its investment opportunity on the internet and further failed to make a determination regarding whether all of its investors were accredited.The Complaint charges Nevada Sports with conducting an unregistered offering of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission accepted Nevada Sport's offer of settlement in which, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, it consented to the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requiring it to send a copy of the final judgment to each investor.The SEC's investigation was conducted by William S. Dixon. The case was supervised by Natalie M. Brunson and Aaron W. Lipson, with the litigation overseen by W. Shawn Murnahan and M. Graham Loomis.

Overview of the Scheme14. Starting in approximately 2010, Appel became involved with Rio Bravo, RedMountain, and Virtual Piggy (together, the ""Issuers""), ostensibly as a consultant working throughother entities he controlled.15. Appel's involvement with the Issuers enabled him to purchase or obtain significantblocks of the Issuers' stock at little or no cost.16. Appel then recnuted several investors (his ""Associates"") to acquire large blocks ofstock in the Issuers through private placements or other private transactions.17. Appel typically permitted his Associates to purchase the Issuers' shares at a discountthrough private placements of the stock only if the Associates also agreed to buy additional shareson the open market.18. Appel used his role with the Issuers to monitor and control his Associates' tradingactivity, including by obtaining from the Issuers certain Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") data.reflecting purchases and sales of the shares?19. To control the Issuers' stock price and liquidity, Appel insisted that his Associatesobtain his permission before selling their shares in the market and reprimanded Associates who soldwithout his permission.2 DTC is a clearing agency, registered with the Coininission, that provides settlement servicesfor securities trades, among other things.5Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 5 of 15 20. Appel also controlled certain Associates' trading activity by entering orders for theirbrokerage accounts over the phone himself or by accessing their brokerage accounts online.21. Appel, directly or indirectly through his Associates, controlled a significant portionof the Issuers' shares available for trading, or the ""float.""22. To support the market price by creating the appearance of liquidin~ and acti~-etrading in the Issuers' stock and to raise the prices of the Issuers' shares enough to qualify them forlisting on a national exchange, Appel engaged in matched trades and other coordinated tradingactivity between and amongst his own accounts and his Associates' accounts.23. During and after his manipulative activity, Appel sold his shares into the market andobtained profits of over $3 million.B. Red Mountain24. In November 2011, Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through hisAssociates, a significant portion of Red Mountain's float.25. On November 30, 2011, Red Mountain filed a Form 8-K with the Commissiondisclosing that, five days earlier, Red Mountain had issued two convertible promissory notes in theamounts of $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively, to two Swiss companies.26. In fact, the Swiss citizen who controlled both Swiss companies was one of Appel'sAssociates (the ""Swiss Associate"")27. From March 5 through December 31, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased 3,483,000shares of Red Mountain common stock in four accountsŠnone in his nameŠover which he heldpower of attorney.28. Of those 3,483,000 shares, the Swiss Associate purchased approximately 3,336,400shares in pre-arranged matched trades from accounts Appel owned or controlled, directly orindirectly.6Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 6 of 15 29. These matched trades included three purchases on March 7, 8, and 9, 2012, executedat $1.47, $1.46, and $1.50 per share, respectively. On each of those days, the Swiss Associate'stransactions were effected at the low trading price of the day.30. Appel also monitored DTC data to detect Associates selling Red Mountain sharesagainst his directions.31. For example, in June 2013, Appel expressed a concern that certain Associates in hisnetwork were secretly selling stock when they were not supposed to: ""[W]e are getting backdooredout of Europe and I want to see if we can tell where it is coming from.""32. In addition, Appel bought and arranged to have his Associates buy Red Mountainstock on the open market at artificially high prices in order to manipulate the stock priceŠthat is, toincrease the stock price from the natural level established by supply and demand.33. For example, in an email to two Associates on January 23, 2013, Appel wrote:Bot 14500 red mtn [Red Mountain] yesterday and had accumulated9k over the last few weeks. Avg. 865. Have ur guy bid for 12500 at.87 and another 7500 at .85 in case we get hit by selling today. (Myguy above that bidding .87).34. In response, one of Appel's associates expressed concern: ""Howard Š we said nomore above 80c [80 cents] Šwhy are you buying at those levels.""35. On January 22, 2013, Red Mountain shares traded between a low of $0.80 and a highof $0.90 per share. The following day, the stock traded between a low of $0.85 and a high of $0.89per share.C. Rio Bravo36. As with Red Mountain, Appel used manipulative techniques to artificially support orinflate Rio Bravo's stock price by creating a false appearance of supply and demand and of increasedtrading volume.Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 7 of 15 37. In addition, although ostensibly a mere consultant to Rio Bravo, Appel actuallyexercised significant decision-making authority with respect to the company's business operationsand capital-raising activities, such that he functioned as an undisclosed de facto officer of Rio Bravo.38. Among other things, Rio Bxavo's nominal chief executive and chief financial officersregularly consulted with Appel concerning major corporate decisions and at times were required toobtain Appel's approval for such decisions.39. For example, in late 2011, to enable Rio Bravo (under a predecessor name) to file aForm 10-K with the Commission, Appel selected Rio Bravo's auditor.40. In February 2012, Appel supervised the transfer of shares in Rio Bravo's predecessorcompany to entities that he and his Associates controlled.41. On February 20, 2012, R.io Bravo began trading in the open market. That day, onlyone trade occurred in Rio Bravo common stock, for 1,000 shares, setting the market price at $0.85per share. When Rio Bravo's shares began trading, Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectlythrough his Associates, most of Rio Bravo's float.42. From February 21 through 29, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased 1,980,000 sharesof R.io Bravo common stock.43. As Appel and the Swiss Associate had arranged, the Swiss Associate purchasedalmost all of these shares-1,918,195 of the total 1,980,000 shares he bought during that periodŠfrom brokerage accounts Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through an Associate.44. For example, on February 21, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased a total of 200,000Rio Bravo shares in four transactions of 50,000 shares each at a price of $0.755 per share.45. In each of these four transactions, the Swiss Associate purchased the shares from anaccount Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through an Associate.Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 8 of 15 46. The Swiss Associate's purchase of 200,000 shares that day constituted 80% of thereported volume of shares traded that day on the market.47. Similarly, on February 23, 2012, the Swiss Associate purchased a total of 282,000shares in four separate transactions at a price of $0.85 per share.48. In each of these four transactions, the Swiss Associate again purchased the sharesfrom an account Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly through an Associate.49. The Swiss Associates trades on February 23, 2012 constituted more than 40% of thereported volume of shares traded that day and Appel sold the Swiss Associate the shares at the lowtrading price of the day.50. Similarly, in March 2012, Appel used an account held by an entity that his Associateowned (the ""Associate Entity"") to engage in another series ofpre-arranged matched trades. Appelused the Associate Entity's account to sell and repurchase a large block of stock from a broker-dealer firm (the ""Market-Maker""), which served as a market-maker for Rio Bravo stock and heldaccounts holding Rio Bravo stock beneficially owned by Appel, his Associates, and the associateEntity.51. On March 13, 2012, Appel instructed a registered representative at the Market-Makerto sell 400,000 shares of Rio Bravo at $1.02 per share from the Associate Entity's account. TheMarket-Maker's own account purchased the shares.52. Approximately two minutes after the sale was executed, the Associate Entity'saccount at a Canadian broker-dealer purchased 100,000 shares for $1.03 per share from the Market-Maker.53. 'Those transactions constituted approxirriately 97% of the reported volume of sharesthat day.9Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 9 of 15 54. On nine trading days over the next four weeks, Appel caused the Associate Entity'sCanadian account to purchase an additiona1300,000 shares of Rio Bravo. In each case, the Market-Maker served as the executing broker on the other side of the transaction and sold the remainder ofthe 400,000 shares it had purchased from the Associate Entity.55. On eight of those nine days, the Associate Entity's purchases were executed at thehigh trading price of the day.D. Virtual Piggy56. In appro~xnately 2012, Appel recnuted several Associates to acquire shares ofVirtual Piggy at a discount through private transactions, private placements, and purchases on theopen market.57. Appel exerted control over the Associates' decisions about when to buy and sellshares.58. For example, in January 2013, Appel emailed an Associate: ""[Y]ou cant [sic] sell vpig[Virtual Piggy] in the market.""59. Later, in a July 2013 email, Appel accused the same Associate of selling Virtual Piggystock ""AGAIN when we are trying to get it listed and having to support it every day."" The Associatereplied: ""I bought it to keep it above 3 [dollars].""60. Between the Associates' Virtual Piggy shares and the shares he owned, Appel directlyor indirectly controlled a significant portion of Virtual Piggy's float.61. To help Appel monitor Virtual Piggy's stock sales, he obtained from a Virtual Piggyofficer weekly DTC data that showed any changes in holdings of Virtual Piggy shares at thebrokerage houses.62. When the DTC data showed that an Associate was selling shares prematurelywithout Appel's permissionŠwhich would tend to lower the stock priceŠAppel reacted quickly10Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 10 of 15 and angrily. For example, in a May 28, 2013 email thread, Appel wrote: ""How much [VI'IG] do youshow [an Associate] having left? I would love to catch him red handed.""63. Similarly, on November 25, 2013, Appel wrote to an Associate:You sold the vpig [Virtual Piggy] and rdmp [Red Mountain] whileyour partners were buying and then conveniently forgot to tell usuntil after the fact, or not at all. You've caused incredible turmoil inboth of these deals because you've been backdooring us and thenlying about it!!64. Appel also duped a member of Virtual Piggy's Board of Directors (the ""Director"")into engaging in matched trades of Virtual Piggy stock to manipulate the stock price.65. Specifically, in May 2012, Appel encouraged the Director to ""support"" the companyby purchasing the stock in the open market.66. At Appel's direction, the Director opened an account at abroker-dealer with aregistered representative (the ""Broker Representative"") who serviced a number of accounts ownedor controlled by Appel and his Associates.67. Appel then instructed the Broker Representative to purchase 245,000 Virtual Piggyshares for the Director at a price of $1.01 per share, which was the high trading price of the previoustrading day.68. Appel knew that the majority of Virtual Piggy shares the Director bought would bepurchased from brokerage accounts Appel owned or controlled, directly or indirectly. Indeed, whenAppel instructed the Broker Representative about the timing of the purchase order, Appel told theBroker Representative that two particular broker-dealersŠwhere Appel controlled accounts holdingVirtual Piggy stockŠwould offer sizeable blocks of the stock.69. On May 2, 2012, the Broker Representative executed the Director's purchase ofVirtual Piggy shares, including the purchase of 190,000 shares at $1.01 per share in four separatetransactions.11Case 2:18-cv-03200-PD   Document 1   Filed 07/27/18   Page 11 of 15 70. Each of these four transactions, totaling 190,000 shares, resulted in the Director'spurchase of shares from brokerage accounts Appel owned ox controlled, directly or indirectly.71. As a result of the manipulative activity in Virtual Piggy and the other Issuers, Appelobtained over $3 million in profits by selling his shares into the public market during the RelevantPeriod.FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEFViolations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(x)(3)72.

Appel with manipulating the stocks of three microcap companies while on supervised release following his criminal conviction for a prior securities fraud.According to the SEC's complaint, Appel orchestrated multiple schemes to manipulate the market for trading in shares of Virtual Piggy Inc., (VPIG), Red Mountain Resources Inc. (RDMP), and Rio Bravo Oil Inc. (RIOB), and concealed his activity by using overseas associates and nominee brokerage accounts.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Appel secretly acquired ownership or control over sufficient shares of the companies so that he and his associates could manipulate their stocks through coordinated trading activity.  As alleged in the complaint, Appel kept tight control over the trading and engaged in matched trading with his associates.  In one instance, Appel allegedly sought to coordinate artificial bidding activity to prevent the price of RDMP from dropping, emailing instructions to his associates:  ""Have ur guy for 12500 at .87 and another 7500 at .85 in case we get hit by selling today. (My guy above that bidding .87).""  In another example in the complaint, Appel sold 200,000 shares of RIOB to accounts controlled by one of his associates overseas in a series of matched trades that accounted for 80 percent of the reported volume on RIOB's second day of trading.The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Pennsylvania, charges Appel with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. Appel has agreed to settle the SEC's charges.  Appel will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The court will determine monetary sanctions and other relief at a later date.On the same day, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also announced a parallel criminal action against Appel.The SEC's investigation was conducted in the New York office by Rhonda Jung, Melissa Coppola and Adam Grace under the supervision of Lara Shalov Mehraban.

Naylor raised over $7 million from hundreds of Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 1 of 18  2  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  investors throughout the United States and Canada through fraudulent, unregistered offerings of common stock and investment contracts. 2. In furtherance of the fraud, Defendants ITEC and Marshall made, and Defendant Naylor aided and abetted the making of, numerous false and misleading statements to investors regarding the payment of commissions to certain investor solicitors (the ﬁSolicitorsﬂ), the value of ITEC™s primary asset, the timeframe for revenue generation, Marshall™s role as ITEC™s control person, and the related party status of ITEC and the operating company, West Port Energy LLC (ﬁWest Portﬂ or ﬁRelief Defendantﬂ). 3. Additionally, Defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by misappropriating investor funds for personal and unrelated business expenses. 4. Defendants ITEC and Marshall also knowingly provided substantial assistance to the Solicitors, who were neither registered with the Commission as brokers or dealers nor were they associated with a broker or dealer registered with the Commission, in soliciting prospective investors and paid the Solicitors transaction-based payments. 5. By engaging in this conduct, as further described herein, each of the Defendants violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, may continue to violate Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. 6.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the Securities  Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b), (g)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d), (e)] to enjoin such acts, practices, and courses of business, and to obtain disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and appropriate. 8. The investments, which took the form of common stock and investment contracts, offered and sold by Defendants, are each a ﬁsecurityﬂ as that term is defined under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)] and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act [5 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)].  9. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint. 10. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa], and 28 U.S.C. 1331. 11.

(f/k/a Amwest Imaging Inc.) is a Nevada corporation formed April 2010 with its principal place of business in Scottsdale, Arizona, and purports to be a project finance and management company for mining operations.  13. William Scott Marshall, age 59, maintains residences in Calgary, Canada, and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, but also spends considerable time in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Although never officially an officer or director of ITEC, at all relevant times, Marshall acted as ITEC™s undisclosed control person. 14. David Michael Naylor, age 54, maintains residences in British Columbia, Canada, and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, but also spends considerable time in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Naylor originally served as ITEC™s CEO and director, but as of April 28, 2014, assumed the role of CFO and director. Naylor is licensed as a Chartered Professional Accountant in Canada.  15. West Port Energy LLC, is a Nevada limited liability company formed on August 1, 2013, with its principal place of business in Scottsdale, Arizona. Based on evidence presently available, staff believes that Marshall is West Port™s sole member. West Port was initially formed to acquire and bring into commercial production the gold mining claims that were the subject of ITEC™s securities offerings. FACTS Background 16. In or around late 2012, while exploring potential natural resource ventures, Marshall became acquainted with an individual, C.W., and learned that C.W. owned the rights to several placer gold mining claims in La Paz County, Arizona. Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 4 of 18  5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  17. Marshall proposed that he and C.W. go in on a business venture in order to commercially develop C.W.™s mining claims. C.W. agreed, and Marshall began pursuing money-raising opportunities. 18. On or around August 1, 2013, Marshall formed West Port and became its sole member. That same month, C.W. quitclaimed his La Paz County, Arizona mining claims to West Port (the ﬁWest Port Claimsﬂ). 19. In or around October 2013, Marshall obtained control of ITEC. Marshall enlisted NaylorŠwho has a history with Marshall and who has been described as Marshall™s ﬁright hand manﬂŠto serve as ITEC™s initial sole officer and director and to receive the controlling block of restricted ITEC common stock. Although not named an officer or director of ITEC, Marshall made all major business decisions for ITEC, including determining how ITEC would raise and spend funds, and otherwise controlled ITEC. 20. On or around November 10, 2013, ITEC and West Port entered into a ﬁFinancing, Production & Assignment of Interest Agreement,ﬂ pursuant to which ITEC was to obtain the necessary funding to bring the West Port Claims into commercial gold production in exchange for a percentage interest in the gross proceeds of any gold obtained from the West Port Claims. ITEC™s Securities Offerings 21. In or around February 2014, ITEC initiated an offering of its common stock, which it never registered with the Commission. 22. To facilitate the common stock offering, Marshall and Naylor created offering documents such as a private placement memorandum (ﬁPPMﬂ), subscription agreement, and offering slide decks, which contained information about the offering and ITEC™s business Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 5 of 18  6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  arrangement with West Port. Although both Marshall and Naylor were involved in drafting these offering and solicitation documents, Marshall had ultimate control over their contents. 23. Additionally, Marshall enlisted the Solicitors to seek out investors on behalf of ITEC. Marshall also determined the Solicitors™ compensation and provided the Solicitors with the offering documents that they would in turn provide to prospective investors. 24. The Solicitors obtained lead lists of prospective investors who resided throughout the United States and Canada and used those lead lists to engage in cold-call solicitations. After initiating contact with a prospective investor over the phone, the solicitors typically mailed or emailed the PPM, subscription agreement, and slide deck to the prospect, and directed the prospect to visit ITEC™s website. 25. Once persuaded to purchase ITEC stock, investors would execute and submit to ITEC a subscription agreement and send their investment funds via either check or wire to ITEC™s bank account, and ITEC would direct its transfer agent to physically issue restricted stock certificates. 26. Using the investment funds it received through its sale of common stock, ITEC, Marshall™s direction, paid the Solicitors commissions ranging from approximately 35% to 50% of the total investment proceeds. 27. As CFO, Naylor authorized and tracked ITEC™s commission payments. 28. ITEC ran its common stock offering through December 2016 and raised over $6 million from hundreds of investors throughout the United States and Canada. 29. In addition to offering common stock, beginning in or around August 2014, ITEC also began offering ﬁSale/Purchase and Processing Agreement for In Situ Au Metalﬂ (the ﬁGold Contractsﬂ). Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 6 of 18  7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  30. The Gold Contracts gave investors the right to purchase a specified amount of gold from the West Port Claims™ future production at a specified and highly discounted price, relative to the then spot price of gold. The Gold Contracts stated that investors would be investing in gold that was ﬁyet to be minedﬂ and was ﬁcurrently in situ.ﬂ 31. The Gold Contracts represented that ITEC would deliver the gold 180 days from the date of the contract and gave investors the option of receiving delivery of physical gold or selling the gold to ITEC™s designated processing company. 32. Solicitation documents sent to prospective gold investors via mail and/or email touted the possibility for gold investors to ﬁearn 60% 80% 100% or more return this year,ﬂ access to the type of investment previously available only to ﬁhigh net worth individuals and venture capital firms,ﬂ and the chance for a ﬁdramatic changeﬂ to an investor™s ﬁretirement plans.ﬂ 33. Through its sale of Gold Contracts, ITEC raised over $1 million from at least 50 investors throughout the United States and Canada. Of that amount, ITEC paid 35% as commissions to Solicitors and pooled the remaining investor funds to purportedly pay for mining expenses. 34. In connection with the offer and sale of the subject ITEC securities, Defendants ITEC and Marshall engaged in, and Defendant Naylor provided substantial assistance in, the making of misstatements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading, and Defendants ITEC, Marshall, and Naylor obtained money or property from ITEC investors thereby. 35. Specifically, through the PPMs, gold contracts, slide decks, and information publicized on ITEC™s website, ITEC and Marshall made, and Naylor aided and abetted the Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 7 of 18  8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  making of, misstatements or omissions regarding (a) the payment of commissions to the Solicitors, (b) the value of the West Port Claims, (c) the time required to bring the West Port Claims into commercial gold production and to begin revenue generation, and (d) Marshall™s control of ITEC and ITEC and West Port™s status as related parties.  36. With respect to the payment of commissions to the Solicitors, the ITEC PPMs represented that 10% of investor funds would be used for ﬁDiscounts & Commissions.ﬂ No other offering or solicitation document mentioned the payment of commissions. Instead, they disclosed only mining related expenses when discussing uses of proceeds. Contrary to these representations, ITEC used 35% Œ 50% of investor funds to pay commissions to the Solicitors. 37. ITEC™s offering documents also made material misrepresentations regarding the value of the West Port Claims. The PPMs and slide decks represented that the West Port Claims had a ﬁproven resourceﬂ with a ﬁminimum average gradeﬂ of 2 to 3 grams of gold per ton of mining material and that the West Port Claims had a ﬁminimum gross valueﬂ of ﬁ$273 million.ﬂ The offering documents failed to mention that these valuation figures were based on limited initial testing conducted by West Port and were never confirmed by an independent geologist.  38. In fact, A.J., the independent geologist ultimately hired to analyze the West Port Claims, stated in his final, May 2015 report, ﬁIt is clear that there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource on [the West Port Claims]. In particular, . . . the average thickness and grade are inadequately known.ﬂ 39. The offering documents additionally contained material misstatements regarding the timeframe within which West Port would begin commercial gold extraction on the West Port Claims. The PPMs and slide decks made representations indicating that commercial gold Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 8 of 18  9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  production would begin within one year of the date of the offering. Additionally, the Gold Contracts stated that ITEC would deliver gold within 180-days from the date of the contract. 40. However, before West Port could begin commercial gold production, it was required to obtain extensive regulatory approval, including submitting a mining plan of operation (ﬁMPOﬂ) to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (ﬁBLMﬂ), obtaining BLM approval of that MPO, and obtaining numerous other federal and state permits. Based on industry standards, completion of this regulatory process could take anywhere from 3 to 10 years from the date an MPO is submitted to the BLM, depending in part on the size of the mining operation. 41. In this instance, the BLM did not receive West Port™s MPO until at or around November 4, 2014Šseveral months after ITEC began disseminating offering documents that represented West Port would begin commercial gold operations by the end of 2014. 42. Although ITEC periodically updated its PPM and other offering documents, those documents continued to indicate that commercial gold production and revenue generation were only months away. 43. In reality, the BLM did not approve of West Port™s MPO until at or around February 2017. In spite of receiving this and other necessary regulatory approvals, to date, West Port has yet to begin commercial operations on the West Port Claims, and neither West Port nor ITEC has generated any revenue. 44. The offering documents also failed to disclose Marshall™s role as ITEC™s control person and that ITEC and West Port were related parties, such that their agreement constituted a related-party transaction. The PPMs and slide decks each contained a section disclosing ITEC™s management; none of those disclosures listed Marshall as ITEC™s control person or even mentioned his involvement with the company.  Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 9 of 18  10  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  45. Likewise, although the PPMs and slide decks represented that ITEC had executed a ﬁformal definitive gold streaming agreementﬂ with West Port, the documents failed to mention that Marshall controlled both ITEC and West Port, that Naylor was involved in the management of both entities, and that therefore the agreement between ITEC and West Port was a related-party transaction. Instead, the offering documents gave the appearance that the agreement constituted an arms-length transaction skillfully negotiated by ITEC™s management. Misappropriation of Investor Funds 46. In addition to engaging in misstatements and omissions, Defendants also defrauded investors through the misappropriation of investor funds.  47. As discussed above, ITEC used over $3 million of investor proceeds to pay exorbitant commissions to the Solicitors.  48. Defendants also used hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds to pay for personal expenses such as gym memberships, resort stays, personal medical expenses, and a vehicle used exclusively by Marshall, as well as to pay for the expenses of other entities controlled by Marshall or Naylor that provided no goods, services, or other benefit to ITEC. Marshall™s Beneficial Ownership and Sale of ITEC Shares 49. Simultaneous with his involvement in the above misconduct, Marshall surreptitiously benefitted from the resale of ostensibly unrestricted ITEC shares into the public markets. 50. In or around November 2013, shortly after Marshall obtained control of ITEC, ITEC issued 2.5 million unrestricted shares of its common stock to a Belizean entity named Anvil International Ltd. (ﬁAnvil Belizeﬂ), purportedly as the result of the conversion of a promissory note (the ﬁNoteﬂ). Although Marshall was, in fact, the beneficial owner of the shares Case 2:18-cv-01566   Document 1   Filed 08/20/18   Page 10 of 18  11  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  issued to Anvil Belize and controlled ITEC, Anvil Belize submitted a ﬁStatement of Non-affiliationﬂ in connection with the Note conversion. 51. Anvil Belize deposited the ITEC shares into a brokerage account in its name, and Marshall directed a nominee of his to obtain trading authority over Anvil Belize™s brokerage account. 52. From April 2014 through April 2016, Anvil Belize sold all 2.5 million ITEC shares held in its brokerage account into the public markets. No registration statement was ever filed pertaining to this sale of ITEC shares. 53. In or around August 2014, Marshall directed Naylor to form a Nevada entity, Anvil International Enterprises Ltd. (dba Anvil International Ltd.) (ﬁAnvil Nevadaﬂ), to receive the funds obtained from the sale of securities out of Anvil Belize™s brokerage account. Between August 2014 and May 2015, Anvil Belize™s brokerage account made payments of approximately $767,000 to Anvil Nevada.

According to the SEC, Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor misled investors about the value of Intertech’s gold mine interest, Intertech’s timeframe for generating revenue, and commission payments Intertech made to securities solicitors. The complaint also alleges that, at Marshall’s direction, Intertech hired numerous individuals to engage in cold-call solicitations of investors. Finally, Marshall and Naylor allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds, which they used to pay for personal expenses such as such as gym memberships, resort stays, personal medical expenses, and a car Marshall exclusively used.The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Nevada, charges Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor with violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint also charges Intertech and Marshall with aiding and abetting violations of the broker registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Intertech, Marshall, Naylor, and relief defendant West Port Energy LLC, a company formed by Marshall and which allegedly received proceeds of the fraud, have agreed to disgorge nearly $7.4 million in proceeds from the alleged fraud, and Marshall and Naylor have agreed to pay civil penalties of $184,767 and $92,383, respectively. Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor have also agreed to permanent injunctions, and Marshall and Naylor have agreed to conduct-based injunctions and permanent officer-and-director and penny-stock bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.The SEC wishes to thank FINRA and the various state, federal, and foreign authorities that provided valuable assistance in this matter, including the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Laurie Abbott, James Thibodeau, and Kenji Kawa, was assisted by Trial Counsel Amy Oliver, and was supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley of the Salt Lake Regional Office.The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."

This matter involves a fraudulent oil-and-gas investment scheme. From February 2015 through March 2016, Harper and Phelps raised approximately $611,000 by selling securities to nine investors.  2. Defendants told prospective investors that investment proceeds would be used to drill for oil in ﬁprovenﬂ fields in Kentucky. These representations were false. Harper and Phelps spent the vast majority of the investor funds on themselves and their families. They paid themselves generous six-figure ﬁsalaries.ﬂ Defendants Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 1 of 10 PageID #: 26536   2  used the investors™ money to pay their rent; to take vacations; to buy consumer goods, a firearm and ammunition, and auto parts. They also spent the money on dating and adult websites, entertainment, golf, and hotels.  3. Although they spent a small amount to drill two wells on two different properties, neither of them was a ﬁprovenﬂ field, and neither well was commercially viable. Despite that, Defendants continued soliciting additional funds from investors, purportedly to drill for oil in both wells. 4. The Commission seeks to permanently enjoin Defendants from engaging in such misconduct, to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and to pay penalties, among other relief.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. The Commission seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and other equitable relief pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. The Commission seeks the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)]. Venue is proper in this district because a substantial part of the acts and transactions giving rise to the claims alleged herein occurred in this district, and because Defendants reside in this district. Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 26537   3  7. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants directly or indirectly made use of the means or instrumentalities of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, the facilities of a national securities exchange, or the mails. 8. Defendants™ conduct involved fraud, deceit, or deliberate or reckless disregard of regulatory requirements, and resulted in substantial loss, or significant risk of substantial loss, to other persons. 9. Unless enjoined, Defendants are likely to continue to engage in the violations of securities laws alleged herein, or in similar conduct that would violate the federal securities laws. DEFENDANTS 10. James Michael Harper, age 35, is a resident of Russellville or Glasgow, Kentucky, in Logan County or Barren County, respectively. During the relevant time period he was the registered owner and a controlling officer of Phoenix Development Drilling Corporation, a private Kentucky corporation, and Regal Development Group, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company. Both entities had principal places of business in Summer Shade and Brownsville, Kentucky, located in Metcalfe County and Edmonson County, respectively. The Kentucky Secretary of State administratively dissolved both entities on October 1, 2016. Both entities are hereinafter collectively referred to as ﬁPhoenix.ﬂ  Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 3 of 10 PageID #: 26538   4  11. Scott Stacy Phelps, age 46, is a resident of Cub Run, Hart County, Kentucky. During the relevant period, he served as Harper™s partner in Phoenix, with effective and equal control over Phoenix™s expenditures, business decisions, and dealings with third parties. FACTS The Offerings 12. From at least February 9, 2015 through March 2016, Harper and Phelps cold-called potential investors, most of whom resided outside of Kentucky, using ﬁlead listsﬂ obtained from third parties.  13. Defendants told prospective investors that their investment would be used to drill for oil on the ﬁprovenﬂ Lee Miles lease in Hart Count, Kentucky. They touted Phoenix as a low-overhead operation.  14. Once a prospective investor expressed interest, the investor received offering materials Œ documents that Harper and Phelps revised, reviewed, approved, and caused to be disseminated. In these offering materials, Defendants reiterated that Phoenix would use the invested funds to drill for oil.  15. Defendants offered different investment opportunities. The ﬁPhoenix 3 Selectﬂ investment concerned the sale of seven ﬁunitsﬂ in three new wells to be drilled by Phoenix on Phoenix-selected oil and gas leases in Hart County, Barren County or Monroe County. In the offering documentation, Defendants represented Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 26539   5  that the main purpose of the enterprise was to develop the ﬁproven Lee Miles leaseﬂ in Hart County, Kentucky.  16. The ﬁPhoenix 3 Preferredﬂ investment concerned the sale of seven ﬁunitsﬂ in three new wells to be drilled by Phoenix on the Miles lease.  17. Both offering documents contained a joint venture and a joint operating agreement. Under the terms of those agreements, each investor Œ referred to as a ﬁWorking Interest Partnerﬂ and a ﬁNon-Operatorﬂ Œ received a 14% per unit working interest in, and a 10% per unit net revenue interest in and to, the oil and gas produced from the Miles lease. Phoenix received a specified net revenue interest in the oil and gas produced, in return for which it would oversee the drilling operations ﬁwith diligenceﬂ and ﬁus[ing] its best efforts.ﬂ  18. Still another Phoenix investment opportunity, an Overriding Royalty Interest (ﬁORIﬂ) in all of Phoenix drilling operations, offered investors ﬁa guarantee of at least 6%ﬂ return on investment for the first year. Investors were told that their money would be ﬁused to further the growth of Phoenix.ﬂ  Defendants™ Spending of Investor Proceeds on Themselves 19. Defendants told investors their money would be used for the oil drilling operations. Phoenix promised to work with diligence, and to use its best efforts, drilling for oil. But Defendants™ primary focus was self-enrichment. Of the $611,000 Defendants raised from investors, they spent no more than ten percent to drill for oil or for other legitimate business expenses.  Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 26540   6  20. Harper and Phelps spent the vast majority of the investor funds on themselves and their families. Harper and Phelps paid themselves purported ﬁsalariesﬂ totaling $112,661 and $118,002, respectively. They also used more than $100,000 of the investors™ money on resorts, amusement parks, golf, jewelry, dating and adult websites, auto parts, gas, groceries, clothing, and online gambling, among other things. Defendants also used investment proceeds to pay their agents to solicit new investors. 21. Defendants and their agents offered investors little in return, spending most of their time golfing, engaging in other recreational activities, and soliciting fresh investment proceeds to finance their lifestyle.  22. Defendants also used new investment proceeds to make Ponzi-like payments to existing investors. Such payments perpetuated Defendants™ fraudulent operation, encouraging additional investments while discouraging redemptions. Defendants represented that these payments were ﬁORIﬂ payments, leading investors  to believe that these payments were oil production revenue from Phoenix™s wells. In fact, Phoenix never made a penny of oil revenue.  Defendants™ Other False Statements to Investors 23. Defendants described the Miles lease to investors as ﬁprovenﬂ or a ﬁproven field.ﬂ But no wells had been drilled on that lease before Phoenix drilled a single, non-producing well.  Case 3:18-mc-99999   Document 741   Filed 08/30/18   Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 26541   7  24. Defendants also raised additional funds from two investors for payments for ﬁcompletionﬂ and ﬁacid treatmentﬂ for one well before that well was actually drilled, falsely representing that the well was already ﬁ[blowing] nice quality oil.ﬂ Defendants did not use the investment proceeds for such purposes. 25. Although Defendants spent a small amount to drill two wells on two different properties, neither well was commercially viable. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that neither well was commercially viable. Despite that, they continued soliciting additional funds from investors, purportedly to drill for oil in both wells. 26. Phelps lied to investors in other ways as well. During golf games he would text investors that he was ﬁin the fieldﬂ or ﬁstaking [out] well locations.ﬂ He told one investor that he was traveling to Canada for a conference with ﬁourﬂ Canadian investors. But Phoenix had no investors in Canada.  COUNT I Violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5  27. Paragraphs 1 through 26 are realleged and incorporated by reference. 28.

2,"1  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,   Civil Action No. 18-6854 v.    Mark Suleymanov    Defendant.      Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) files this Complaint against Defendant Mark Suleymanov (ﬁSuleymanovﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ), and alleges as follows: SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS 1. Between at least early 2012 and early 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of binary options securities over the internet. Suleymanov, who was doing business as SpotFN and a number of other brands, raised at least $4 million from retail investors, some of whom were senior citizens without investment experience. As a result of the scheme, investors suffered losses, including losses of retirement funds, which SpotFN encouraged investors to use. 2. Suleymanov operated a SpotFN website and other related websites, which misrepresented the profitability of investing in binary options using SpotFN™s platform, as well as investors™ ability to access their funds. In reality, Suleymanov used software to manipulate investors™ trading results to increase investor losses. In addition, Suleymanov caused many investors to be unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds.    Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 1 of 12 PageID #: 1 2  3.  The SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor™s funds would be held in a segregated account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN™s business expenses. In fact, investors™ funds were commingled in bank accounts controlled by Suleymanov, who misused certain investor funds for both business and personal expenses.  4. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Suleymanov violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder, and the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c)] and unless restrained and enjoined will again engage in violations of these provisions. 5. The Commission seeks an order enjoining Suleymanov from further violations, requiring Suleymanov to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing monetary penalties. JURSIDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa]. 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa]. 8. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, used the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint.  Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 2 3  9. Venue is appropriate in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the offers and sales of securities, and acts and transactions constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint, occurred in the Eastern District of New York, and Suleymanov resides and transacts business in the District.  DEFENDANT 10. Mark Suleymanov, age 38, is a resident of Glen Cove, New York. Suleymanov did business as SpotFN, an unincorporated entity offering and selling binary options over the internet. Suleymanov established the SpotFN.com website, as well as related websites such as BinaryAcademics.com, AssetSignals.com, BinaryFN.com, and OptionsMogul.com, among others. He opened and controlled bank accounts to which investors sent their money. Suleymanov also controlled the risk settings on software that caused investors to lose money they had invested in SpotFN binary options.    FACTS Suleymanov Created a SpotFN Website, and Related Websites, to Sell Binary Options Securities  11. Between at least early 2012 and early 2016, Suleymanov offered and sold binary options securities to customers throughout the United States through a number of different public websites, including SpotFN.com, BinaryFN.com, and OptionsMogul.com, among others (collectively, ﬁSpotFNﬂ). Each of these web domains was registered to and controlled by Suleymanov. The SpotFN web domains included BinaryAcademics.com, which purported to sell educational materials that would supposedly improve an investor™s performance, and AssetSignals.com, which purported to sell trading ﬁsignals,ﬂ or tips on market movements, that would also supposedly improve investors™ trading results. Via these ﬁeducationalﬂ sites, Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 3 4  Suleymanov encouraged investors to make more trades on the SpotFN platform, which resulted in investors incurring more losses.  12. The SpotFN binary options were options contracts of short duration that were based on the price of stocks and stock indexes, or other financial assets. A binary option™s payout depended on the outcome of a ﬁyes/noﬂ proposition. For example, SpotFN offered and sold binary options in which an investor would choose whether a given stock™s price would be above or below a specified price at a specified time. When the option expired, the investor would either earn a pre-determined amount if he chose correctly, or he would earn nothing and forfeit the amount of his investment if he chose incorrectly. Binary options are securities within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act when they take the form of options based on the value of a security or index of securities.  13. Investor funds were sent, either by wire or via credit card processors, into bank accounts that had been opened and were controlled by Suleymanov. Suleymanov received approximately $4 million in investor funds through these accounts.  14. Suleymanov caused SpotFN™s website to falsely represent that SpotFN was a legitimate incorporated entity with officers and directors, when in fact, for most of its existence, it was not. Suleymanov also caused SpotFN™s website to misleadingly feature the NASDAQ logo, despite the fact that SpotFN™s binary options were not traded on NASDAQ or any other regulated exchange.  Unregistered Offers and Sales of SpotFN Binary Options 15. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e], it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to offer or sell securities using the U.S. mails or interstate commerce, unless (1) the offer or sale is registered with the SEC pursuant to a valid registration statement Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4 5  that applies to that specific offering; or (2) the offer or sale is specifically exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5.  16. No registration statement was filed or in effect as to the offer and sale of binary options through the SpotFN websites. In addition, no exemption from the registration requirement applied. Suleymanov directly sold the securities via SpotFN, creating and maintaining the websites through which the securities were offered and sold. Suleymanov Made Material Misrepresentations and Engaged in a Fraudulent Scheme  A. Suleymanov Misrepresented that Binary Options Trading Would Be Profitable  17. On the SpotFN websites, Suleymanov made false statements about the significant and sustainable profits that investors could expect from trading binary options using SpotFN™s platform, and about SpotFN™s motivation to have clients™ trading be successful. For example, the SpotFN.com website stated:   ﬁUp to 88% Return.ﬂ   ﬁ[Clients] will be able to have their investment account become a self-sufficient, lifelong source of funds accessible when needed at any time.ﬂ   ﬁThe final result is to have clients be able to withdraw on a consistent basis, without affecting their ever-growing account balance.ﬂ  ﬁAt SpotFN, we want our clients to be able to attain a constant source of income.ﬂ   ﬁWe are looking to create longstanding sustainability for our clients that will be shown by the growth of their portfolios.ﬂ    ﬁWe are highly motivated to make our clients as successful as possible in trading for the very reason that your success is our success.ﬂ  18. These statements were materially false and misleading because Suleymanov in fact caused losses for investors. In contrast to the ﬁup to 88% returnﬂ that the site touted, many investors ultimately lost all, or nearly all, of their invested capital. One investor™s account experienced an ultimate win rate of only 38%, resulting in the loss of his entire account balance. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 5 6  Other investors experienced similarly dismal results, with the same ultimate outcome: depleted accounts, no matter how much they invested. B. Suleymanov Engaged in Deceptive Conduct to Cause Losses for Investors 19. As part of a scheme, Suleymanov engaged in deceptive conduct to cause losses for investors. One way that he achieved this was through the SpotFN trading model. The trading model worked in the following way: when investors placed a losing trade, they forfeited 100% of the amount of that trade. When they placed a winning trade, they typically received 70-80% of the amount of the trade. Because the amount of a loss was larger than the amount of a gain, on average, assuming a 50% win rate, an account would cumulatively lose value the more it was traded.   20. In addition, Suleymanov used a restrictive withdrawal policy to encourage SpotFN customers to place a large volume of trades which would lead to more losses. Although the website stated that the client™s success meant SpotFN™s success, the truth was just the opposite. The funds that the customers lost, SpotFN gained.  21. Suleymanov also acted behind the scenes and used software to manipulate the rates at which customers won or lost trades. Suleymanov admitted in a February 2016 email to the company that sold him the software that he used it to give new customers high rates of winning trades initially to encourage them to invest more funds, then he adjusted the setting so the investors would experience losses. Suleymanov stated:  ﬁWe use that as a marketing tool to lure customers in for the first time, get them to deposit as much as possible, let them win– then once all their funds and wires come in, we then turn that feature into a positive for the platform. –We are controlling the situation with them. The wins are their way of bringing in the funds to the company. We discussed this– that clients will be given bonuses in the beginning to see how easy they can win. But again, once the funds are in, that setting gets adjusted to a loss for them. This is not our first day at the park with this.ﬂ  Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 6 7  C. Suleymanov Falsely Promised Investors Easy Access to Their Funds 22. Suleymanov caused the SpotFN websites to promise investors ﬁhassle free withdrawalsﬂ that were ﬁfast and secure.ﬂ One of SpotFN™s selling points was that investments would generate profits that would be ﬁaccessible when needed anytime.ﬂ In reality, however, Suleymanov caused many investors to be unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds. 23. Suleymanov™s primary technique for retaining investors™ money was SpotFN™s so-called bonus policy. When investors opened accounts, SpotFN frequently credited them with ﬁaccount bonuses,ﬂ credits which increased an investor™s trading account balance beyond what he had personally funded. In some cases, investors recalled being offered these bonuses as an inducement to fund a certain amount into their accounts, but in other cases, investors simply discovered that the amounts had been added without their consent. Investors were not warned that the bonus money came with consequences: that every bonus dollar in an account had to be traded thirty times before SpotFN would approve any withdrawal request from that account. When an investor placed a withdrawal request for funds from his account, SpotFN would often cancel the request, citing this policy. 24. Some investors increased the volume of trading in their accounts, in order to be eligible for cash withdrawals. However, increased trading volume meant that the investors™ account balances depleted quickly as a result of trading losses.  25. Some investors received other excuses as to why their requested withdrawals never arrived. These excuses ran the gamut from supposed bank errors, to computer failures, to frozen accounting software, to accidental misrouting to the wrong account. A few investors did receive some amount of withdrawal or refund, after the investor threatened to pursue a fraud claim or charge-back against SpotFN with their bank or credit card company. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 7 8  26. The SpotFN websites are no longer operational. Once the websites were removed from the internet in early 2016, investors found that their telephone calls and emails to SpotFN were no longer answered. Since investors™ only access to their accounts had been through the SpotFN websites, all ability for investors to access or view their account balances, trade or transaction history, or any other data, vanished along with the site. There was no advance warning that SpotFN would be going out of business, and no procedure for investors to get refunds of the balances in their accounts.  D. Suleymanov Misrepresented That Investors™ Funds Were Held in Segregated Accounts and Used Only for Trading Binary Options  27. Suleymanov caused the SpotFN website to state that: ﬁUpon receipt of your deposit(s), SpotFN will place your trading capital into one or more segregated client account(s).ﬂ The website stated that the funds could not be used in the course of SpotFN™s business, adding, ﬁFunds are used only for trading options through our website upon client™s instructions and are never used for any other cause.ﬂ The website also stated, ﬁSpotFN™s Compliance Department ensures that your deposited funds and trading profits are secure,ﬂ adding that ﬁthe Compliance department specializes in combating fraud and money laundering, ensuring that your funds are always protected.ﬂ  28. Contrary to these representations, SpotFN did not have a Compliance Department, and investors™ funds were not placed into segregated accounts. When investors transferred money to SpotFN to fund their SpotFN trading accounts, their money was actually commingled in several bank accounts that were opened and controlled by Suleymanov. This was material because investors™ funds were not used as represented; the funds were not secure or protected as promised; and Suleymanov had access to investors™ funds to use for his own purposes, which was not disclosed to the investors.  Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8 9  E. Suleymanov Misused Investor Funds  29. Suleymanov misused certain investor funds. Instead of ensuring that investors™ funds were used only for the trading of options as the SpotFN website had claimed, Suleymanov used some of these funds to pay business expenses, such as the payment of salary and other compensation to employees, as well as personal expenses, such as payments on his personal mortgage. In addition, Suleymanov wrote checks from these accounts to his family members, and made transfers from these accounts to other business entities that he controlled, ultimately draining each account of funds.

Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds. Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds. As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses. In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses.The SEC's complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

At all relevant times in this Complaint, Hengen's wife was a vice president ofhuman capital at a UnitedHealth subsidiary. As part of her responsibilities, Hengen's wifeworked on human resource aspects of mergers and acquisitions, including the potential effects ofa transaction on employment contracts and the retention of key staff. As part of her work,Hengen's wife regularly received and worked with confidential information about companiesUnitedHealth was in negotiations to acquire.USMD Holdings, Inc.15. In June 2015, UnitedHealth initiated negotiations to acquire USMD. Thenegotiations, which were confidential, continued off and on for more than a year. In March 2016,UnitedHealth submitted a written proposal to acquire USMD, but negotiations continued overphysician and executive team retention and other issues, and the merger was not finalized foranother six months. Hengen's wife was involved in these negotiations and on occasion travelledto Texas as part of them.16. During the relevant time period, Hengen's wife typically worked from home atleast once a week. When she worked from home, she would frequently set up a workstation atthe dining room table.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 4 of 11 17. One morning in June 2016, before his shift began in the afternoon at the aiiport,Hengen, who was in the upstairs bedroom at the time, overheard his wife on a work conferencecall. He heard her mention the words ""USMD"" and ""Dr. House."" Hengen searched the internetfor both terms and learned that USMD was a healthcare company based in Texas and that ""Dr.House"" was Dr. John House, Chairman and CEO at USMD. Hengen knew that his wife had beentraveling to Texas frequently for work, and that her work involved mergers and acquisitions.Based on these facts, Hengen concluded that UnitedHealth was in negotiations to acquireUSMD.18. Hengen knew the information about UnitedHealth's potential acquisition ofUSMD was both material and nonpublic. He knew that it could be profitable to trade on theinformation and purchase shares of USMD stock. He also knew that it would be wrong to do so.For approximately two weeks, Hengen debated whether he should use this information topurchase shares of USMD.19. On or about June 27,2016, Hengen decided to trade on the material andnonpublic information concerning the acquisition of USMD. That day, in breach of his duty oftrust and confidence to his wife, Hengen bought 5,657 shares of USMD stock for an averageprice of $16.33 per share in two personal brokerage accounts.20. Beginning on or about the same date, and again in breach of his duty to his wife,Hengen also tipped his brother and three coworkers, recommending that they too buy USMDstock. Hengen did this because he wanted to provide them with a gift of a stock tip from whichthey could profit.21. On or about June 27,2016, Hengen recommended to his brother that he purchaseUSMD stock. Hengen told his brother that there likely would be a merger between USMD andCASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 5 of 11 UnitedHealth. On June 27,2016, acting on this tip, Hengen's brother purchased 300 shares ofUSMD stock for $16.19 per share.22. On or about June 27,2016, Hengen recommended to Coworker 1 that he purchaseUSMD stock. On June 28, Coworker 1 bought 100 shares of USMD for $16.83 per share. OnJune 30, Coworker 1 bought an additional 350 shares of USMD for $18.75 per share.23. On or before July 11,2016, Hengen saw Coworker 2 at work and recommendedto him that he buy USMD stock. On July 11,2016, Coworker 2, intending to buy 1,000 shares ofUSMD, mistakenly bought just 1 share of USMD for $17.50. On August 29,2016, Coworker 2bought the remaining 999 shares of USMD at $20.45 per share.24. On or before July 13,2016, Hengen recommended to Coworker 3 that he buystock in USMD. On July 13,2016, Coworker 3 bought 100 shares of USMD for $18.02per share.25. In July and August 2016, Hengen attempted to obtain updated information aboutthe status of the acquisition from his wife. He paid attention to her work phone calls that hecould overhear, and he asked how her work was going and whether her recent business trips toTexas had been successful. Hengen concluded from her responses that work was going well andthat the acquisition negotiations were progressing. By late August Hengen expected theacquisition to be announced within a few weeks.26. Through August 2016, Hengen continued to trade on material nonpublicinformation concerning the acquisition of USMD. On August 5,2016, Hengen sold 2,557 sharesof USMD stock for $19.90 per share. On August 16, Hengen purchased 2,000 shares for $20.01per share. On August 26, he purchased another 400 shares at $20.33 per share. On August 29,Hengen purchased an additional 46 shares for $20.49 per share.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 6 of 11 27. Hengen also continued tipping material nonpublic information concerning theimpending acquisition to his brother and coworkers throughout July and August 2016, and theycontinued purchasing additional shares of USMD.28. For example, in a text message exchange on July 22,2016, Hengen toldCoworker 1 to ""Hang on to usmd"" because ""Good news coming soon."" The next month, in a textmessage exchange on August 26,2016, Hengen told Coworker 1 that ""Big news [is] comingsoon for usmd"" and to ""Make sure u have usmd before market close."" That same day, Coworker1 bought an additional 1,000 shares of USMD for $20.43 per share.29. Between July 25 and August 19,2016, Coworker 3 bought an additional400 shares of USMD, at prices ranging from $19.99 to $20.77 per share. On August 26,2016,Hengen's brother bought an additional 50 shares of USMD for $20.33 per share.30.

Thatday, after the public announcement of the acquisition, the market price of USMD stock increasedmore than 8% on heavy trading and closed at a price of $22.18 per share.31. That day, after the acquisition announcement, Hengen sold 5,500 shares ofUSMD stock for $22.16 per share. Hengen later received $22.34 for his remaining 46 shares ofUSMD stock, which he held through the close of the acquisition on October 3,2016. Hengen'sillicit profits from trading in USMD stock totaled $32,315.32. Hengen's brother and coworkers sold all of their shares of USMD stock onAugust 30 and August 31,2016. Their combined profits from trading on Hengen's unlawful tipstotaled $8,340.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 7 of 11 Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc.33. In late July 2016, UnitedHealth entered into negotiations to acquire Surgical Care.Negotiations were put on hold in September 2016 and then resumed in December 2016. By lateDecember 2016, UnitedHealth bad taken substantial steps towards commencement of a tenderoffer for Surgical Care securities. These included a meeting on December 16 between the CEOsof UnitedHealth and Surgical Care at which they reached agreement on major terms of theproposed acquisition (including the per share acquisition price), the execution of a confidentialityagreement on December 19, and due diligence work.34. Hengen's wife was informed of UnitedHealth's potential acquisition of SurgicalCare on December 20,2016. She participated in two conference calls about the potentialacquisition on December 21 and 22,2016.35. On or about December 27,2016, on a day Hengen's wife was working fromhome, Hengen walked through the dining room where his wife was working. She was not in theroom at that moment. Hengen opened his wife's notebook that was on the table and sawreferences to Surgical Care Affiliates. Knowing that his wife worked on corporate acquisitionsfor UnitedHealth, Hengen concluded that UnitedHealth likely was in negotiations to acquire thecompany referenced in his wife's notebook. Hengen knew this information was both materialand nonpublic, and that it was wrong for him to trade on it.36. In breach of his duty to his wife, Hengen traded on the material nonpublicinformation he misappropriated from his wife concerning UnitedHealth's potential acquisition ofSurgical Care. Between December 27 and December 30,2016, Hengen purchased in his personalaccounts a total of 3,160 shares of Surgical Care stock, at an average purchase price of $46.54per share.CASE 0:18-cv-03135   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 8 of 11 37.

Robert Lozuk, age 39, lives in Carlsbad, California and between June 2015 and October 2016 was the Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations at Sequenom, where he was employed since October 2012.   RELEVANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUAL 10. Sequenom, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Diego, California.  Sequenom is a life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  Sequenom was acquired in a 2016 tender offer by LabCorp, and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of LabCorp.  Sequenom™s common stock was formerly registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and was traded on the NASDAQ (ticker: SQNM).    11. Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina.  The common stock of LabCorp is registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: LH).   12. Individual A is a childhood friend of Lozuk. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 13. Sequenom is a life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  On June 8, 2016, Sequenom™s board of directors instructed a large investment bank to contact LabCorp and a few other companies to assess their interest in acquiring Sequenom, which was Case 3:18-cv-01765-LAB-BGS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 7   4   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28    subject to a large amount of outstanding debt.  Sequenom engaged in due diligence and entered into negotiations with LabCorp, and on July 20, 2016, representatives of Sequenom and LabCorp agreed upon an acquisition price of $2.40 per share.   14. At the time of the acquisition, Lozuk was the Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations at Sequenom, and a direct report to the CEO.  In addition to the duties imposed on Lozuk as an officer and director of Sequenom, Lozuk was also subject to Sequenom™s written policy, applicable to all Sequenom employees, preventing insider trading and its code of conduct.  Further, Lozuk had signed a confidentiality letter in October 2015 acknowledging his obligation not to disclose to anyone, including certain other co-workers, material nonpublic information regarding Sequenom™s efforts to address the company™s outstanding debt obligations.   Ultimately, the board of directors decided to seek an outside buyer.   By at least June 8, 2016, Lozuk became aware of the potential for an outside company to acquire Sequenom. 15.   On July 21, 2016, Lozuk attended a concert with Individual A.  Having signed the October 2015 confidentiality letter, Lozuk knew that he owed a duty to Sequenom not to provide any material nonpublic information regarding the contemplated LabCorp-Sequenom deal to Individual A.  Nevertheless, while at the concert, Lozuk told Individual A that LabCorp was about to purchase Sequenom.   At the time of the tip, Sequenom™s shares were trading close to $1.  Individual A knew that Lozuk was providing this material nonpublic information in breach of a duty Lozuk owed to Sequenom.   16. On July 27, 2016, the companies announced that LabCorp, through its wholly owned subsidiary Savoy Acquisition Corp., would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sequenom in a cash tender offer for $2.40 per share, or $371 million including Sequenom™s net indebtedness.  After the announcement of the merger, Sequenom™s stock price increased 176% to $2.35 per share.  The total daily trading volume increased from 363,087 on the day before the announcement to 40,718,435 on the day of the announcement Œ an increase of 11,214.5% in one trading day.

Immediately following the announcement of the LabCorp-Sequenom merger on July 27, 2016, Individual A sold all of his shares for a realized profit of $26,643.80.   18. Lozuk tipped Individual A with information concerning the LabCorp acquisition that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, was material and nonpublic.  19. Lozuk knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he owed a fiduciary duty and other duties of trust and confidence to Sequenom and its shareholders, to maintain the confidentiality of the material nonpublic information that he possessed in his capacity as a senior vice president and employee of Sequenom.  By providing Individual A with material nonpublic information, Lozuk breached the fiduciary duty and other duties of trust and confidence that he owed to Sequenom and its shareholders.  Either directly or indirectly, Lozuk gained, or expected to gain, a personal benefit from conveying to Individual A material nonpublic information in the form of a gift to a childhood friend.  20. At the time Lozuk tipped Individual A, and at the time Individual A traded on the basis of material nonpublic information, LabCorp had taken a substantial step or steps to commence its tender offer for Sequenom.

(""Sequenom"") has agreed to settle charges that he engaged in insider trading after tipping his friend about Laboratory Corporation of America Holding's (""LabCorp"") bid to acquire Sequenom in a July 2016 tender offer.The SEC's complaint alleges that Robert Lozuk, who was formerly Sequenom's Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations, tipped his friend (""Individual A"") about the pending acquisition during a social event they both attended a week before the public announcement. According to the complaint, Lozuk was not only subject to Sequenom's written policy and to certain obligations as an officer of the company, but he had also signed a confidentiality letter acknowledging his obligation not to disclose to anyone the company's plans. Nevertheless, Lozuk tipped Individual A, and over the next two trading days Individual A purchased a total of 18,000 Sequenom shares. On the date of the public announcement, Sequenom's stock price increased 176%, allowing Individual A to sell his shares that same day for a profit of over $26,000.Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lozuk agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and to a five-year bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. Lozuk will pay a penalty of $26,643. Individual A, who provided timely and valuable assistance to the SEC's investigation, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement wherein he agreed to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $26,643, and among other things, agreed not to violate the federal securities laws for the deferred period of two years.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Adrienne Gurley and supervised by Marc Blau.

This SEC enforcement action is being brought to stop an ongoingoffering fraud, where the defendants have promoted a fake technology and illusoryprospects for its commercial success to enrich themselves with investors' funds. Thefederal securities laws vest in this Court the power to enjoin, on an emergency basis,further violations of the law. The Court also has the equitable authority to freeze theassets of securities law violators for the good of defrauded investors, order them toprovide a sworn accounting of their financial affairs, and prohibit them fromdestroying relevant documents. Because defendants continue to raise money frominvestors, and have a history of quickly dissipating investor funds for their personaluse, the SEC now brings this action to secure that emergency relief from this Court.2. Defendant Moddha Interactive, Inc. (""Moddha"") calls itself a""worldwide Positive Media and Technology Corporation."" Defendants Sandor andPorrazzo, who are married, are Moddha's only officers or directors. Moddha claimsto own an ""exclusive proprietary portfolio of patents based on the QuantumTransducer ('QT'),"" a technology that will ""revolutionize"" conventional mobilephones, allow consumers to operate tablet devices ""with the wave of your hand as ifyou were Tony Stark in Iron Man,"" and produce ""a more elegant, thinner, healthierand more energy-efficient device than iPhone and Android."" In meetings withpotential investors, Moddha demonstrated a tablet device, similar to an iPad butcapable of displaying 3D images, that supposedly incorporated Moddha's patented""QT"" technology. Sandor and Porrazzo also burnished Moddha's commercial bonafides with claims that it had just become a ""Registered Supplier"" of a globaltelecommunications firm (""Global Telecommunications Firm""). On the basis of thispresumed technology, Moddha has raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors since2012 through a private placement offering of its unregistered securities. These funds,however, were procured by fraud: Moddha's purported ""Quantum Transducer""COMPLAINT 1Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 2 of 27     PageID #: 2 technology is a sham.3. In truth, Moddha's intellectual property portfolio consists of only ahandful of patents, all of which are expired and thus commercially worthless. Thedevices touted by Moddha's offering materials and demonstrated by Sandor andPorrazzo to potential investors were either fake, or were designed and developed byother companies. Moddha never had, and continues to have no business relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm. And instead of using investor funds instrict accordance with the limitations contained in Moddha's private placementmemorandum, the majority of the money Moddha raised in the last year has beenmisappropriated through transfers to Sandor and Porrazzo's personal accounts andspent on personal things that have nothing to do with the business, including a 7-nightstay at a luxury hotel the week of Thanksgiving in 2017.4. Investor money was also funneled to defendant Spar Street, to pay himsales commissions for acting as a sales agent for the offering and drumming up newinvestors. Street, however, has never registered with the SEC to be a broker.5. When confronted by their investors, Sandor and Porrazzo compoundedtheir lies, repeatedly claiming that a large influx of funds was imminent andModdha's investors would soon be made whole through a dividend share buyback.They claimed this new money would come from the Global TelecommunicationsFirm, or from a wealthy investor whose forthcoming $150 million investment inModdha was delayed, the defendants claimed, due to a variety of excuses, includingsickness, gun violence at an embassy, and the eruption of a volcano in Iceland. Thiswas false - the Global Telecommunications firm does not do business with Moddhaat all, and there is no imminent new funding from some alleged wealthy investor. Inspite of defendants' increasingly outlandish excuses, Moddha's expired patentportfolio and sham business had no prospect of generating real returns for itsinvestors.6. By engaging in this conduct; (i) defendants Moddha, Sandor, andCOMPLAINT 2Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 3 of 27     PageID #: 3 Porrazzo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15U.S.C. § 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and RulelOb-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5; and (ii) defendant Street violated thebroker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.§ 780(a).JURISDICTION AND VENUE7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b),20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d)(l) & 77v(a), and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e) and 27(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(l),78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e) & 78aa(a).8. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means orinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a nationalsecurities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses ofbusiness alleged in this complaint.9. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the SecuritiesAct, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of conduct constitutingviolations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district. In addition,venue is proper in this district because defendants Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street residein this district, and defendant Moddha has its principal place of business in thisdistrict.DEFENDANTS10.

Moddha's Securities Offering14. In a November 2014 filing and a February 2018 amended filing with theSEC, Moddha stated that it had been engaged in an offering of unregistered securitiessince July 7, 2012. Moddha's SEC filings further stated that as of December 31,2017, the company had raised over $2.6 million from 51 investors located in multiplestates.15. Moddha solicits investors for its securities offering through thecompany's website, online professional profiles for Sandor and Porrazzo, the use ofsales agents, in-person meetings with potential investors, and written offeringmaterials provided to investors and potential investors, including a private placementmemorandum (""PPM""), and has been doing so since at least 2015.16. Porrazzo and Sandor are Moddha's chief technology officer andchairman/chief executive officer, respectively; they are Moddha's only officers ordirectors; they possess sole control over decisions concerning Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 4Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 5 of 27     PageID #: 5 management, operation, and policies; they affixed their names to many of the writtenmaterials provided by the company to potential investors, and thus, on informationand belief, Porrazzo and Sandor each had ultimate authority over the content ofModdha's offering materials, including its PPM, and whether and how tocommunicate that content to investors and potential investors.17. In its offering materials, Moddha dubbed itself as a ""worldwide PositiveMedia and Technology Corporation.""18. Moddha's PPM described its purported business in sprawling terms,claiming that it is; (i) poised to profit from ""consumer product sales, subscriptionservices; including vast licensing dollars with its proprietary hardware, software andoriginal content in diverse global industries""; (ii) ""currently offeringtelecommunications products and services licenses worldwide, with an initial focuson the Middle East and Africa, Western and Eastern Europe, South America, Mexico,Central America and the Caribbean, with future plans to expand into Asia, India,North America and beyond""; and (iii) creating ""its own proprietary content and alsoacquiring existing media, such as documentary films and educational games as wellas feature films, for providing to its Global Digital Subscription Network, connectingschools world-wide.""19. A key representation in the PPM is that Moddha ""owns an exclusive,proprietary portfolio of patents based on the Quantum Transducer (QT).""20. When describing its purported Quantum Transducer, ""QT"" technology,the company's PPM claimed that:a. ""There is at least one transducer in everything electronic andabout 15 transducers in a cellphone. All other transducers perform only one function... QT performs multiple functions and frequencies simultaneously, sending andreceiving without interference on the same paper-thin surface.""b. ""QT replaces conventional transducers ...

""QTs operate with such levels of efficiency, improvement andcost-effectiveness that QT's transform all electronics and offer entirely new ways ofharnessing wireless electricity that can help bring balance to the planet.""21. Moddha also represented in its offering materials that its proprietary QTtechnology had been incorporated in an array of Moddha products, including whatModdha called its ""Q-Tablet"" and ""Q-Connect Smart Phone"" devices.22. According to Moddha's PPM, its ""patented revolutionary QT technologyprovides a new interface to create and distribute 3-D interactive content"" through aproprietary touchscreen that Moddha called, ""WaveScreen,"" which ""allows you tomanipulate and interact with your device in 3-D with the wave of your hand, as if youwere Tony Stark in Iron Man. But QT and the WaveScreen aren't science fiction;they are science-fact.""23. Having incorporated the QT-enabled ""WaveScreen"" interface into itsproducts, Moddha's PPM claimed that ""MODDHA is positioned to change the faceof consumer electronics, media, telemedicine and education by featuring the QTWaveScreen interactive display interface technology, on its Q-Tablet and Q-ConnectSmart Phone devices.""24. This was all a sham. Moddha's extravagant claims of having secured theintellectual property rights for a ground-breaking technology that would transform theconsumer electronics, media, telemedicine, and educational markets were uniformlyfalse.25. Moddha had no true revenue-generating relationships with anyone, muchless as a ""Registered Supplier"" to the Global Telecommunications Firm.26. At bottom, Moddha's unregistered securities offering was simply ameans to fund Sandor's and Porrazzo's lifestyle, in stark contravention of Moddha'sCOMPLAINT 6Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 7 of 27     PageID #: 7 PPM, which explicitly set forth how investor funds were to be used.27. Moddha's offering is ongoing, and defendants are continuing to solicitinvestors and obtain investor funds.B. The Material Misrepresentations and Omissions1. Moddha's Expired and Worthless Patent Portfolio28. To convince potential investors that it could profit from its technology,Moddha needed them to believe that the company had intellectual property rights toQT.29. On that subject, Moddha's PPM repeatedly stressed that it owned avaluable and expansive portfolio of patents which covered the purported QTtechnology:a. ""MODDHA owns its own exclusive proprietary portfolio ofpatents based on the Quantum Transducer ('QT') that simplifies, harmonizes andexpands the capabilities currently offered by conventional communications,electronics, display interfaces and wireless delivery.""b. ""MODDHA believes its patents comprise the hardware formodem-day touch-screens.""c. ""MODDHA is poised to capture a dominant position in today'scellular telecom market with its patented QT technology that increases reception andtransmission quality ...""d. ""MODDHA'S patented, multi-functional transducer technologyhas the potential to provide not only significant incremental changes, but also long-term, dismptive replacements in nearly every major industry worldwide.""e. ""The proven history of QT has opened the door for manysuccessful high-tech companies like Apple, Philips Electronics,Google/HTC/Motorola and Samsung, to catapult themselves to over $50 billionannually with the use of trade secrets, IP and patented technologies that are nowowned and protected by MODDHA. MODDHA desires to collect infringementCOMPLAINT 7Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 8 of 27     PageID #: 8 damages from companies once they have been legally judged to have infringed or tohave agreed to settle.""30. In the same vein, Moddha's offering summary - which bears bothSandor and Porrazzo's names - claims that ""MODDHA owns its own exclusiveproprietary portfolio of patents based on Quantum Transduction ('QT') that iselegant, simple and expands the capabilities currently offered by conventionalcommunications, electronics, display interfaces, wireless delivery, wearabletechnology and 3D interactivity.""31. Sandor and Porrazzo also affixed their names to a PowerPointpresentation used with investors, which referred to Moddha's ""proprietarytechnologies"" and similarly represented that Moddha had a ""Well Protected,Established, Mature Intellectual Property Estate.""32. Porrazzo and Sandor also represented, during in-person meetings withpotential investors, that Moddha owned patents which covered its technology. Theserepresentations were specifically made in an October 2017 meeting with a marriedcouple who were solicited to invest.33. These representations of an immensely valuable and enforceable patentportfolio were false.34. Moddha owns only five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (""USPTO"") related to transducers and speakers. The five patents wereassigned to Moddha in 2011.35. At the time they were assigned to Moddha, two of Moddha's five patentshad already expired. Those two patents had expired by operation of law in 2004because of the patent-holder's failure to pay the required maintenance fees with theUSPTO.36. The last three Moddha patents had all expired as of May 2014 becauseeach patent's statutory patent term had expired.37. In 2017, a consultant to several of Moddha's investors confrontedCOMPLAINT 8Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 9 of 27     PageID #: 9 Porrazzo and Sandor about Moddha's expired patent portfolio. Porrazzo and Sandoradmitted that Moddha's patent portfolio had expired.38. Moddha, Sandor, and Porrazzo's representations that Moddha heldenforceable intellectual property rights for its claimed technological innovation wereimportant to Moddha investors when they decided to invest their money in Moddha'sunregistered securities. The purported QT technology was central to the company'sbusiness, and without patent protection for that technology and the products whichembodied it, Moddha would not be able to commercially profit from it.2. Lies About Moddha's Ability to Buyback ""Share Dividends""39. Since at least 2015, when offering Moddha securities, Sandor andPorrazzo communicated to investors and potential investors that Moddha was a safeinvestment because they would at least get all of their invested capital back throughModdha's ""founder's"" share program.40. Sandor and Porrazzo represented that if investors purchased Moddha'ssecurities within a limited window of time, investors would receive ""founder's""shares that provided an automatic share dividend equal to the amount invested; inother words, a ""two for one"" deal. For example, a purchase of 100 ""founder's"" shareswould entitle the investor to an immediate dividend of another 100 shares.41. Sandor and Porrazzo also told investors that Moddha was on the cusp ofreceiving a large infusion of capital that would allow the company to buy back thedividend shares, thereby returning the investor's capital while still giving them theability to participate in future gains.42. In 2015, Porrazzo and Sandor claimed that this impending infusion ofcapital was going to come from a wealthy investor who would put $ 150 million intoModdha.43. In one case, in or about 2015, Sandor showed an investor an email thatpurportedly confirmed another person's commitment to transfer $150 million toModdha.COMPLAINT 9Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 10 of 27     PageID #: 10 44. As time passed, however, and the investor questioned Porrazzo andSandor about when the capital infusion would in fact occur, Sandor provided thatinvestor with increasingly absurd explanations for the delay.45. Sandor claimed first, that the $150 million investor was sick, and thenthat he was delayed by a shooting at a foreign embassy, and finally that the $150million payment was held up because the investor's flight had been grounded by theeruption of an Icelandic volcano.46. In the end, the purported $ 150 million cash infusion never came, andModdha never returned the inquiring investor's funds.47. More recently, Sandor and Porrazzo have told investors that thecompany would be able to buy back investors' dividend shares with revenues from itscommercial relationship with the Global Telecommunications Firm.48. As just one example, Porrazzo and Sandor met in October 2017 with twopotential investors who owned a local business in Hawaii.49. After demonstrating Moddha's purported Q-Tablet and claiming that theproduct had been patented, Sandor also provided the potential investors with aPowerPoint presentation that prominently featured the Global TelecommunicationsFirm's trademark logo throughout, which was entitled ""[Global TelecommunicationsFirm] Business Case for Moddha Spatial 3D Q-Tablet & Software Apps.""50. In her transmitting email, Sandor told the potential investors that:As I mentioned, we have just become a registered supplier with[Global Telecommunications Firm]. I have included our veryCONFIDENTIAL MODDHA - [GLOBALTELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRM] Deck. (Please do notdistribute). It is only 7 slides and encapsulates much and willexplain the products we will be bringing to the market. :)51. Every slide of the PowerPoint presentation Sandor sent contained theGlobal Telecommunications Firm's trademark, and the presentation stressed amongother things that, ""[Global Telecommunications Firm] profits from the $113 billionCOMPLAINT 10Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 11 of 27     PageID #: 11 3D Display market, selling exclusive Moddha S3D Tablets.""52. The husband and wife business owners subsequently invested $500,000in exchange for 5,000 of the company's supposed ""founder's"" shares. Like otherinvestors, the couple were told by Sandor and Porrazzo that they would be receiving ashare dividend of another 5,000 shares, which they could quickly redeem withModdha through a share buyback, thus recouping their $500,000 capital investmentwhile still holding on to their original 5,000 shares of Moddha stock.53. In a November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor again touted thecompany's supposed dividend share buyback program: ""MODDHA intends to offera full cash redemption of your MODDHA Dividend Share Certificates at the issueprice the dividend was made equaling $100 per share ... To our knowledge and byour research, MODDHA is the only Private Company in history, who will have everprovided a 100% return dividend, and we are excited to blaze the trail for othercompanies to follow.""54. In this same November 3, 2017 shareholder update, Sandor repeated theclaim that Moddha was ""now a Registered Supplier to [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm]"" and also included the same PowerPoint presentationcontaining the Global Telecommunications Firm's trademark.55. The November 3, 2017 shareholder update also included new claims that""the powerpoint [sic] ... was circulated amongst the higher ups of [the GlobalTelecommunications Firm] and received a resounding unanimous vote to partner withMODDHA. [The Global Telecommunications Firm] has requested to sell MODDHAproducts in all [the Global Telecommunications Firm's] Stores Nationwide. There isa desire from [the Global Telecommunications Firm] to co-brand the Q-Tablet andQuartz headset. We are considering the request.""56. Months later, after their share redemption still had not occurred, thehusband and wife Moddha investors received a January 2018 email from Sandorattempting to explain the delay:COMPLAINT 11Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 12 of 27     PageID #: 12 Greetings and Aloha MODDHA Shareholders ... This is a quicknote to let you know that our executive team, Fsicl were all downand offline for the past 5 weeks with this horrible high feverbronchial flu. Fortunately, we have all recovered and despite nothaving any holiday at all, nor any Christmas, nor New Year'scelebration with our families, we have made it through and aretoday back to work.We have been advised that there were some remaining ...documents required to be executed with [Moddha's transferagent.] We are now executing those documents so that [thetransfer agent] can be fully empowered ... and provide therequired services for your share dividend redemption ... Althoughit was out of our control that our whole team came down with thisviolent influenza at such a critical moment, we wish to apologizeto each of you, for any hardship this delay, and/or our being out oftouch has caused to you.57. Then in April 2018, Sandor sent another shareholder update claimingthat the share buyback was merely awaiting ""final approval from securities counsel.""58. Despite Sandor's promises, Moddha has never redeemed the husbandand wife's ""founder's"" shares. The company has not returned any portion of the$500,000 they invested in the company last fall.59. Sandor and Porrazzo have never told investors that Moddha didn't havethe financial wherewithal to make a share buyback or that the claimed relationshipwith the Global Telecommunications Firm was categorically false.60. From January 2017 to April 2018, the daily ledger balance on Moddha'sbank account has never exceeded $200,000.61. Moddha is not a ""Registered Supplier"" of the GlobalTelecommunications Firm.62. The Global Telecommunications Firm never authorized Moddha to useits name or trademark in connection with Moddha's solicitation of investors, or forany other purpose.COMPLAINT 12Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 13 of 27     PageID #: 13 63. The Global Telecommunications Firm has never asked to sell Moddhaproducts in any of its stores.64. Moddha has not received a single dollar in sales, licensing, or otherrevenue from the Global Telecommunications Firm.65. Moddha's, Sandor's, and Porrazzo's representations that investors wouldbe able to quickly recoup their invested capital, while still maintaining an equity stakein Moddha going forward, were important to Moddha investors. Moddha, Sandor,and Porrazzo's claims that the dividend share buyback would be paid for by,alternatively, an impending $ 150 million transfer from an individual investor, orrevenues generated through Moddha's commercial relationship with the GlobalTelecommunications Firm, were likewise significant to investors' decision to invest.That is because these false statements went to a fundamental feature of theinvestment Š the safety of the investment and whether Moddha investors wereguaranteed to at least the return of their invested capital.3. Misrepresentations About How Investor Funds Would Be Used66. Sandor and Porrazzo are the only signatories on Moddha's corporatebank accounts.67. Moddha's PPM contains a detailed description and table stating thatfunds raised from investors would be used on specific business-related costs.68. Among other things, the PPM stated that funds were to be used to ""buildand install the dedicated servers for the global network, to produce the Q-ConnectSmart Phone and Q-Tablet, to manufacture the ready prototype products, [and] todevelop and integrate the Wave Screen interface onto the QT products.""69. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo made specific representations toinvestors in personal meetings about how their investments would be used.70. For example, one investor was told, in or about summer 2015, thatModdha specifically needed the funds for manufacturing its Q-Tablet in China.71. Other investors understood from Porrazzo and Sandor that the moneyCOMPLAINT 13Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 14 of 27     PageID #: 14 they invested would be used by Moddha for its business, rather than for Porrazzo'sand Sandor's personal expenses.72. These representations concerning how Moddha, Porrazzo, and Sandorwould use money raised from the company's investors were false. Of theapproximately $827,025 in investor funds raised from January 2017 to April 2018,for instance, the majority of that money was diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo for theirpersonal use or to co-defendant Street as commissions.73. The following chart shows how the $827,025 of investor money wasdiverted to Sandor, Porrazzo and Street:n-Tvpe^ExpenseNet Transfers to Sandor's and Porrazzo's personalaccounts, including transfer to overseas account$221,373Commission payments to Spar Street, the sales agent$104,835Travel (including airfare, Airbnb, and hotels)$51,227Auto (including lease, service, and fuel)$15,372Retail (including grocery, liquor, and departmentstores)$13,830Restaurants$7,461ATM cash withdrawals$3,953Sandor and Porrazzo's charity in Kenya$2,200Percentage of Investor FundsŁ 51%74. Included in these funds diverted to Sandor and Porrazzo were amountsspent at retailers of products that have no evident business purpose, such as TheHome Depot, Liquor Barn, Target, and Walgreens.75. One egregious example occurred from November 19 to 26, 2017 duringThanksgiving week. In that week, Sandor and Porrazzo used Moddha investor fundsto stay at a luxury hotel in Santa Monica, California, where they spent upwards ofCOMPLAINT14Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 15 of 27     PageID #: 15 $2,400 a night on a room and purchased hundreds of dollars of food, drink, and spatreatments, including a $425 bottle of wine. All told, Sandor and Porrazzo's seven-night stay at the hotel was paid for with $15,884.01 in investor funds.76. In the same vein, on May 3, 2017, a Moddha investor transferred$50,000 to the company. Sandor and Porrazzo immediately misappropriated thesefunds, transferring $20,000 of that amount to Porrazzo's bank account the same day.77. And in the most recent set of corporate bank records obtained during theSEC's pre-filing investigation, Moddha's beginning account balance on April 1, 2018had dwindled to $6,036.91. On April 3, 2018, a Moddha investor transferred $50,000to the company. Once again, Sandor and Porrazzo quickly caused $10,000 ininvestor funds to be diverted to their personal and joint bank accounts, on the verysame day those investor funds first came in to Moddha's corporate account.78. In addition to these personal transfers, Sandor and Porrazzo spent$182,964 to satisfy two legal judgments against Moddha from January 2017 to April2018.79. In that time period, there is no indication in Moddha's bank records thatinvestor funds were used to manufacture QT products.80. Investors would have wanted to know that money raised by Moddha'sstock offering would not be used for working capital, as stated in the PPM, andinstead be diverted to Sandor, Porrazzo, and Street.C. The Scheme to Defraud Investors81. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated investor money bytransferring funds from Moddha's corporate account, for which Sandor and Porrazzowere the only two signatories, for their personal use.82. Moddha, Sandor and Porrazzo also gave potential and current investorsthe false appearance that Moddha's business was real, and that its supposed QTtechnology had already been incorporated into tangible and innovative products.83. Their artifice was simple, yet effective: Sandor and PorrazzoCOMPLAINT 15Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 16 of 27     PageID #: 16 demonstrated products in meetings with investors, including the Q-Tablet featured inthe company's offering materials, when in fact the products they showed investorswere made by unrelated companies and did not incorporate any of Moddha's claimedtechnology.84. In particular, the Q-Tablet - which did generate a 3D image that manypotential investors found impressive - used by Sandor and Porrazzo for productdemonstrations was instead designed and manufactured by a wholly-unrelated third-party technology company. In 2017, Sandor admitted to an investor consultant thatanother company owned and had developed the tablet used in Moddha'sdemonstrations, but insisted that Moddha owned 51 % of that other company. Whenpressed for documentation of Moddha's ownership, Sandor changed her story andsaid that the demonstration tablet had really been manufactured by a San FranciscoBay Area company that she refused to identify.85. Similarly, Moddha's offering materials contained images of otherproducts supposedly being developed by Moddha, including ""wearable technology,""""bone induction headphones,"" and a QT-powered speaker. Those images, though,were faked - the photos were of other companies' products that had been altered toappear as if they had been developed by Moddha.86. In addition, Sandor and Porrazzo showed investors pre-produced videosthat purported to show Moddha's products working as claimed, but when an investorconsultant asked them to reproduce those results in a real-life setting, Sandor andPorrazzo refused to do so.87. Sandor and Porrazzo engaged in a bait and switch, enticing investors toinvest by telling them they would get a share dividend equal to 100% of theirinvestment (the bait), when in reality, Moddha lacked the funds to follow through ona promised buyback of investors' share dividend, and instead gave investorsprogressively more absurd excuses as to why the new funding never came (theswitch).COMPLAINT 16Case 1:18-cv-00264-DKW-RLP   Document 1   Filed 07/09/18   Page 17 of 27     PageID #: 17 88. Sandor and Porrazzo also lied to investors to lull them into believingnothing was wrong and to avoid any detection of their fraud.89. In November 2017, Sandor","The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to halt an ongoing offering fraud carried out by Marianne Veronika Sandor, her husband Edward Michael Porrazzo and their company, Moddha Interactive, Inc.The SEC's complaint, which was unsealed on July 13, in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo told investors that Moddha Interactive had a valuable portfolio of patents for a supposed 3-D technology that can be used with tablet devices. As alleged in the complaint, however, this was false because Moddha Interactive's patents had expired and were worthless, and the technology they promoted either did not exist or was developed by other, unrelated companies. Also, according to the SEC's complaint, in an effort to promote the safety of the investment in Moddha Interactive, Sandor and Porrazzo lied about a share dividend buy-back program and how they would use the investor funds they raised. The complaint alleges that Sandor and Porrazzo misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds to support their lifestyle. In addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that Moddha Interactive paid over $200,000 in sales commissions to their co-defendant, Spar Street, who illegally acted as an unregistered broker in selling Moddha Interactive's shares to investors.The SEC's complaint, filed under seal on July 9, 2018, charges Sandor, Porrazzo and Moddha Interactive with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint also charges Street with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as other emergency relief. The SEC's complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jasmine M. Starr and Carol Shau and supervised by Victoria A. Levin of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gary Leung and supervised by Amy J. Longo."

When soliciting investors. Defendants used complex and confusing language tomisrepresent the operation and safety of the PBF program, as well as their use of investor funds.In fact, the PBF program had little substance and never generated profits. Investors lost all oftheir money.4. Defendants misappropriated investors' funds. They used the bulk of the money topay Young's personal expenses and the child support of another individual, as well as to fund aseparate entity controlled by that individual.5. Defendants also never disclosed to investors Young's criminal and disciplinaryhistory, including past sanctions against him for fraud and theft, despite statements on theGuardians Trustee website touting Young's industry background.6. The interests Defendants offered were investment contracts, which are securities.Defendants also improperly failed to register their securities offering.7.

Defendants invited PGO members to placemoney in an irrevocable inter-vivos life insurance trust (""ILIT"") with the investor and GuardiansTrustee serving as co-trustees. The Defendants represented that these funds would then beplaced in the PBF program to generate retums.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 4 of 15 15.

Defendants promised investors that theirreturns would be generated from the efforts of Young and others through the PBF program.16. Defendants used a variety of written materials, including the www.Perfectlight.uswebsite, trust creation documents, and ""bond trust indenture operating agreements"" (collectively,the ""Offering Materials"") to describe the PBF program and inform investors about the offering,the safety of investor funds, and promised retums. Young drafted, posted on the Internet,mailed, and emailed the Offering Materials using means of interstate commerce.17.

Defendants raised at least $170,000 from the offering. Defendants directed all ofthese fimds into Guardians Trustee bank accounts controlled by Young. These funds weredeposited via electronic funds transfer systems using means of interstate commerce.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 5 of 15 B. Defendants Made False and Misleading Statements About the PBF Program'sOperation, Safety, and Use of Funds and Failed to Disclose Young's Criminal andDisciplinary Background.20. In the Offering Materials, Defendants represented that the fiinds investors used tocapitalize an ILIT would be ""hypothecated"" (loaned) by Guardians Trustee to the PBF program.The PBF would then engage in bank-like activities to generate income, including making loansto other PBF program participants.21. Also in the Offering Materials, Defendants represented that income from theseactivities would then be available to the investor in the form of a revolving line of credit(""RLOC""), allowing the investor to access 400% of the amount of funds the investor contributedto the trust. Defendants represented that investors would be required to repay their draws fromthe RLOC, but that each payment an investor made would also increase the amount of fundsavailable to the investor by four times the amount of the payment.22. Defendants further represented in the Offering Materials that investors' fundswere safe and would be indemnified against loss through the operation of the ""US LegalReserve."" Defendants described this purported reserve as a Federal Reserve-like entity thatguarantees the payment of life insurance claims.23. Defendants used complex and confusing language to hide the lack of substance totheir investment program. In reality. Defendants did not have the means to use PBF programactivities to generate 400% returns, or to use any insurance reserve fund to secure investormonies that were invested in the PBF program.24. For example, Defendants made the following statements about the operation ofthe PBF program on the Website. The other Offering Materials made similar representations.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 6 of 15 a. ""The PBF has ""developed and utilizes a series of proprietary, highly sophisticatedma±ematical algorithms that match hypothecated capital assets with long termliabilities... held with a separate Equity Depository Trust.""b. ""The core component of the PBF is a unique Credit Facility that has the effect ofplacing capital in motion, initiating a process called Continuous CapitalFormation.""c. ""This mechanism is ""combined with Aggregation of solid, unwavering Collateralsupported by the US Legal Reserve to provide an entirely new class of monetaryassets, called Collateral Based Assets, offered exclusively through PBF CapitalReserve System.""25. On the Website, Defendants also described the returns available to investors asfollows. The other Offering Materials made similar representations.a. ""The PBF Credit Facility drives the PBF mechanism. As new capital (cash) isdeployed. Capital Reserves are established. The Credit Facility is subsequentlyable to provide leverage of these funds equal to 400% of the Capital Reserves. Aminimum of $4,000 (cash) of new initial capital is required to start the PBFContinuous Capital Process.""b. ""Thus, a $4,000 new initial Capital contribution yields a $16,000 Credit Reserve""accessible to the investor in the form of a revolving line of credit.c. ""[A] Credit Asset is equal to four times the cash value of the Capital Asset(cash).""d. ""[C]redit Assets allow consumption of good and services and the building ofcapital wealth, measured in US Dollars, through the surplus of Credit Assets(400%) over and above the more limited cash value (100%).""26. On the Website, Defendants summarized the PBF program as follows. The otherOffering Materials made similar representations.In short, money is being employed by the Co-Tmstee such that capital isconstantly being created and recreated, as he or she elects to engage in the processof Continuous Capital Formation, and ultimately unlimited Disposable CashFlow. As a result, the ILIT continues to grow Assets, and the Assets are under thelegal and financial protection of the Trust at all times, while being indemnifiedagainst loss... through the Collateral Based Assets backed by the US LegalReserve.Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 7 of 15 27. In fact, contrary to Defendants' representations in the Offering Materials, the PBFprogram did not engage in any activities to generate income and could not have generated thepromised 400% retums.28. In addition, contrary to Defendants' representations in the Offering Materials,Defendants did not use investor funds for investment purposes. Instead, Defendantsmisappropriated all funds, using the money to pay for Young's personal expenses and travel, forthe back child support obligations of another individual, and for start-up costs for an unrelatedentity controlled by that individual. Defendants did not disclose any of these uses of investorfunds.29. Furthermore, contrary to Defendants' representations in the Offering Materials,the funds investors placed in the program were not safe or guaranteed through any reserve fund.Investors lost all of the money they invested.30. In addition, despite touting on the Guardians Trustee website Young's ""manyyears of experience in the Insurance, Investment, and Commercial Banking Industries[,]""Defendants did not disclose in any of the Offering Materials the prior criminal and regulatorydisciplinary actions against Young - all of which were known to Defendants - which include thefollowing:a. In 2015, Young was convicted in Indiana of felony insurance fraud, forgery andtheft for a scheme in which he unlawfully used another person's identity to sellinsurance products and misappropriate the commissions from those sales. Heserved approximately 30 days in jail as a result of that conviction.b. In 2010, Young was found liable by the Indiana Securities Division of theDepartment of State for securities fraud in connection with the sale ofCase 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 8 of 15 unregistered securities. Young was permanently barred from the securitiesindustry in Indiana, ordered to repay investors over $186,000 and assessed a$25,000 civil penalty. To date, Young has not paid any of the ordered restitutionor penalty.c. In 2011, Young had his license to sell insurance in Indiana permanently revokedby the Indiana Commissioner of Insurance for engaging in the sale of insuranceand trusts through the use of fraudulent and dishonest business practices.31. Each of these misrepresentations and omissions would be material to thereasonable investor since each of them related to the fundamental nature of the investment: theuse of investors' funds, the means by which Defendants would use investors' funds to generateprofits, the returns investors would receive, the safety of their investments, and prior actionsagainst the person responsible for generating investment returns.32. Defendants each knew or was reckless in not knowing, and was negligent in notknowing, that the misstatements and omissions in the Offering Materials were materially falseand misleading.C. Defendants Engaged in Fraudulent Acts, Practices, Courses of Business, and aScheme to Defraud Investors.33. From at least November 2016 through February 2018, Defendants engaged infraudulent acts, practices, courses of business, and a scheme to defraud investors in the PBFprogram.34. Defendants' fraudulent acts, practices, and courses of business, and acts infurtherance of their fraudulent scheme, included, but were not limited to:a. Drafting and disseminating false and misleading statements about the PBFinvestment program and using complex and confiising language to misleadCase 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 9 of 15 investors about the operation of the program, the returns it would generate, andDefendants' uses of investment funds;b. Misappropriating investors' monies for Young's personal use, as well as to paythe debts of another individual and an entity that individual controlled; andc. Keeping secret the information about Young's criminal and other history of thefland fraud, including securities fraud, which information is necessary to maketruthful statements in the Offering Materials describing Young's industryexperience and professional history, and the disclosure of which might alertinvestors to the possibility for fraud in this offering.35. Defendants' actions in furtherance of the scheme were knowing or reckless andresulted from Defendants' negligence.36. Defendants' fraudulent acts, practices, courses of business, and fraudulent schemewere material to the reasonable investor because Defendants' conduct related to the fundamentalnature of the investment: the use of investors' funds, the means by which Defendants would useinvestors' funds to generate profits, the returns investors would receive, the safety of theirinvestments, and prior actions against the person responsible for generating investment retums.D. Defendants' Offering was Unregistered and not Exempt from Registration.37. From approximately November 2016 through February 2018, Defendants offeredand sold interests in the PBF program, which were investment contracts and therefore securities.38. Defendants offered and sold PBF program investment contracts when noregistration statement was filed or in effect for the transactions. Defendants raised at least$170,000 from ten investors in multiple states in the PBF investment contract offering. Noexemption from registration was available for this offering.10Case 2:18-cv-00115-SWS   Document 1   Filed 07/11/18   Page 10 of 15 39. Defendants offered and sold PBF program investment contracts to investors usingthe means or instruments of interstate commerce including but not limited to telephones, theInternet, and the mails.40. Defendants offered and sold PBF program investment contracts to somermaccredited investors. Neither of the Defendants had a reasonable basis to believe that all PBFprogram investment contracts investors were accredited.41. Defendant Young cannot rely on any Regulation D exemption under theSecurities Act due to his 2015 felony conviction.V.

18,"SEC v. Caufield         Page 1 Complaint IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS DALLAS DIVISION                  § SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, §         § Plaintiff,      §         § v.        § Case No. __________            §  THOMAS J. CAUFIELD,     §         §   Defendant.      §         §  COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ), for its Complaint against Defendant Thomas J. Caufield (ﬁCaufieldﬂ), alleges: SUMMARY 1. From at least as early as 2013 through 2017, Defendant Thomas J. Caufield convinced investorsŠincluding his advisory clientsŠto invest more than $6 million in his high-yield promissory notes by misrepresenting key aspects of the offering.  Caufield represented that he would use investor funds to acquire and operate a franchise that offered investment education programs.  Instead, he used a large portion of the funds for other purposesŠincluding paying returns to earlier investors and paying past-due franchise expenses.  He also misled investors about the franchise™s financial condition and the safety of the investments.  The investor victims included both students of the franchise and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC (ﬁDAT Capitalﬂ)Ša former state-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield. 2. Caufield conducted his offering through a collection of entities he wholly owned and controlled.  These entities offered and sold the notes, which promised 10%-18% annual                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 1 of 11   PageID 1 SEC v. Caufield         Page 2 Complaint returns.  Caufield used a combination of verbal pitches and written offering materials to solicit investors, falsely portraying the investment as lucrative and safe.  He did not disclose that: (1) the franchise routinely failed to meet its current financial obligations; (2) the notes were not secured by the franchise™s business assets, as claimed; and (3) investor funds would be used to pay his obligations on the prior, past-due notes.  Additionally, Caufield did not register the offering with the SEC as required. 3. By engaging in this conduct, Caufield violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  He also violated the fiduciary duties he owed to his advisory clients.  In the interest of protecting the public from any further violations of the federal securities laws, the SEC brings this action.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The SEC brings this action under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)], Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], and Section 209(d) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)] seeking to permanently restrain and enjoin Caufield from engaging in the unlawful acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein. 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)], Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], and Section 214(a) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14]. 6. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails or of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, or courses of business described in this Complaint.                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 2 of 11   PageID 2 SEC v. Caufield         Page 3 Complaint 7. Venue is proper because the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business described below occurred within the jurisdiction of the Northern District of Texas. PARTIES 8. Plaintiff SEC is an agency of the United States of America charged with enforcing the federal securities laws. 9. Defendant Caufield, age 59, resides in Colleyville, Texas.  Caufield started in the securities industry in 1984 as a registered broker-dealer representative and worked in the securities industry in various capacities until 2015.  Although not presently registered with the SEC or associated with a regulated entity, Caufield was the sole associated person, operator, and owner of DAT CapitalŠa state-registered investment adviser from 2008 to 2015.  During the offering, Caufield operated the franchise out of Irving, Texas and Frisco, Texas. FACTS A. Caufield acted as an investment adviser. 10. For more than 30 years, Caufield worked in the securities industry in various capacities.  In 2008, he established DAT CapitalŠwhich was registered as an investment adviser in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Texas.  Through DAT Capital, Caufield provided investment advisory servicesŠincluding recommending investments in different securities.  He provided these services for a fee, which was based on the amount of client assets under management.  Caufield managed as much as $13 million in client assets as part of his advisory business. 11. As an investment adviser, Caufield was a fiduciary to his clients.  Consequently, he had a fundamental obligation to act in his clients™ best interests and to provide investment advice that was in their best interests.  He also owed his clients a duty of undivided loyalty and                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 3 of 11   PageID 3 SEC v. Caufield         Page 4 Complaint utmost good faith.  Finally, he was required to employ reasonable care to avoid misleading his clients and to provide them full and fair disclosure of all material facts. B. Caufield offered unregistered securities. 12. In 2011, Caufield sought to expand his business activities and entered into discussions with a franchisor about purchasing its Dallas, Texas based franchise.  The franchisor and its franchises were in the business of providing investment education classes.  Caufield ultimately acquired the franchise later that year.   13. After that, from at least as early as 2013 until 2017, Caufield coordinated a series of integrated securities offerings to raise capitalŠpurportedly to finance and operate the franchise.  In these offerings, he offered high-yield notes with annual interest rates ranging from 10% to 18%.  The maturities on the notes ranged from 60 days to 24 months.  These offerings, which were not limited to accredited investors,1 were not registered with the SEC. 14. These offerings were an integrated offering, since they shared a number of key characteristics: (1) Caufield controlled the operations of each of the note issuers and their bank accounts and facilitated the transfer of funds between the issuers and the franchise; (2) Caufield did not take any steps to verify whether the investors were accredited; (3) Caufield represented that franchise revenues would be used to repay investors; (4) Caufield represented that investor funds would be used to pay the expenses of acquiring and operating the franchise; (5) Caufield represented that each note would be secured by franchise assets; and (6) Caufield portrayed the franchise as a financially successful business venture.                                                  1 An accredited investor is high-net-worth and/or sophisticated investor, as defined by the relevant statutes, rules, and regulations.                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 4 of 11   PageID 4 SEC v. Caufield         Page 5 Complaint 15. Between 2013 and 2017, Caufield raised approximately $6.8 million through the integrated securities offering.  He received investments from more than 30 investorsŠincluding his advisory clients, to whom he recommended the investments. C. Caufield made material misrepresentations in connection with the securities offering. 16. Caufield marketed the notes through both verbal presentations and written materials.  When doing so, he misled investors regarding the financial condition of the franchise and the risks of the notes. 17. As Caufield knew as its owner and operator, the franchise was strained financially throughout the time of the offering.  It was not generating sufficient revenue to pay its current liabilities.  As a result, the franchise could only stay afloat by using proceeds from the offeringŠrather than business revenuesŠto pay these liabilities. 18. For example, Caufield knew that the franchise was regularly delinquent in its franchise payments to the franchisor.  This resulted in the franchise violating the terms of the franchise agreement, which jeopardized Caufield™s ownership of the franchise.  Caufield cured these delinquencies by using incoming investor funds from the offering to pay the past-due obligations.  On at least six occasions, Caufield used a total of $368,362.31 in investor funds to pay the franchise™s obligations to the franchisor. 19. Despite the franchise™s strained financial condition, Caufield touted its supposed financial success when offering the notes to prospective investors.  In both written offering materials distributed to investors and verbal pitches, Caufield claimed that the franchise was a profitable and financially successful enterpriseŠeven though it was not. 20. Caufield also sometimes included unaudited financial information for the franchise in his written offering materialsŠincluding a profit-and-loss statement and facts on                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 5 of 11   PageID 5 SEC v. Caufield         Page 6 Complaint student enrollment and tuition.  This financial information was misleading because it portrayed the franchise to be financially successful.  It did not disclose important information regarding the franchise™s liabilities, including details about the millions of dollars in notes payable from the offering. 21. Caufield also representedŠboth verbally and in writingŠthat the notes were secured by the franchise™s assets.  In reality, however, Caufield never caused the franchise, or any of the entities he controlled, to file a financing statement in favor of the investors.  Nor did he ever cause the franchise to segregate proceeds for the purpose of repaying the notes.  Therefore, in reality, the notes were completely unsecured. D. Caufield misapplied investor funds in order to keep the franchise afloat and to pay promised returns on the notes. 22. Due to the franchise™s strained financial condition, Caufield deceptively misapplied investor funds to keep it afloat.  He also failed to disclose this deceptive conduct to investors.   23. Caufield represented that: (1) he would use investor funds to finance franchise operations (typically advertising campaigns or expansion and relocation expenses); and (2) he would use franchise operating revenues (not funds from other investors) to repay investors.  However, as the controller of the bank accounts, he did not actually do this.  In realityŠsince the franchise was failing financially, as detailed aboveŠCaufield resorted to misapplying investor funds both to pay unauthorized business expenses and to pay the promised investment returns.                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 6 of 11   PageID 6 SEC v. Caufield         Page 7 Complaint E. Funds were repaid to investors through payments from later investors and the sale of the franchise. 24. From 2013 to 2017, Caufield raised $6,762,031.37 from investors while returning $6,147,216.23 to them.  This left a shortfall to investors of $614,815.14. 25. After the SEC™s investigation began, the franchisor placed Caufield and the Dallas franchise on heightened supervision.  Then, in 2018, the Dallas franchise was sold to an independent third party.  The sale of the franchise, pursuant to terms set by the franchisor, resulted in an additional distribution of $1,329,976.97 to the franchise™s student investors.

Caufield convinced more than 40 investors to invest over $6 million in his high-yield promissory notes by promising investors significant returns generated from the revenues of what he claimed was a profitable franchise. Caufield allegedly used a combination of false pitches and offering materials to lure investors, who included both students of the franchise and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC-a former state-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield. According to the complaint, Caufield misled investors about the franchise's bleak financial condition, used new investor money to repay earlier investors, and falsely claimed that investors' notes were secured by assets.The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas, charges Caufield with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Caufield consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating these provisions, and from engaging in certain future activities in connection with the purchase, offer and sale of securities. The final judgment orders disgorgement of $614,815.14 plus prejudgment interest of $126,032.11, both of which will be deemed satisfied by proceeds repaid to certain investors from Caufield's 2018 sale of the franchise. Caufield also agreed to a $160,000 civil penalty and will be barred from further association with certain regulated entities.The SEC's investigation was led by Robert C. Hannan and Melvin Warren with litigation assistance from Christopher A. Davis, and supervised by Scott F. Mascianica and Eric Werner."

CARR AND KATHERINE M. HANRATTY, )  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED         )     Defendants.   )          ) COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ or ﬁSECﬂ) alleges the following against defendants Robert O. Carr (ﬁCarrﬂ) and Katherine M. Hanratty (ﬁHanrattyﬂ).   SUMMARY 1. This case involves insider trading by Carr, a New Hampshire resident, and Hanratty, a Connecticut resident, in the shares of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. (ﬁHeartlandﬂ), a New Jersey-based company, ahead of its December 15, 2016 announcement that it was to be acquired by Georgia-based Global Payments, Inc. (ﬁGlobalﬂ).  Carr, then the Chief Executive Officer (ﬁCEOﬂ) of Heartland, tipped Hanratty, his romantic partner, to material, nonpublic information that was expected to Œ and did Œ dramatically increase the value of Heartland™s stock.  Specifically, Carr tipped Hanratty concerning the acquisition of Heartland by Global, and Hanratty purchased Heartland stock while in possession of, and on the basis of, that material, nonpublic information provided by Carr. 2. Carr, as the CEO of Heartland, was intimately involved in the negotiations from October to December 2015 that led to his company™s acquisition by Global.  Carr shared material, nonpublic information about the potential acquisition of Heartland by Global with Hanratty at various times during this period.  For example, on or before November 9, 2015, Carr Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 1 of 13 2  revealed to Hanratty that he would be meeting with the CEO of Global on November 9, 2015, to discuss the potential acquisition of Heartland by Global.  That same day, after Carr™s meeting with the Global CEO had concluded, Carr sent an email to Hanratty and told her on that Global had offered to acquire Heartland for a premium per share of Heartland™s stock, and told Hanratty that the acquisition of Heartland would be completed by mid-December 2015.  Thereafter, on November 15, 2016, Carr provided Hanratty a check for $1 million and instructed her to use that money to open a brokerage account and purchase $900,000 worth of Heartland stock.  Hanratty acquired the Heartland securities as instructed by Carr, completing the purchases of Heartland stock weeks prior to the news of the acquisition of Heartland by Global became public in December 2015.   The acquisition of Heartland by Global caused Heartland™s stock price to significantly increase, and Hanratty eventually sold the stock for a profit of over $250,000.  3. By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Carr and Hanratty violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder. NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT 4. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)].  The Commission seeks a permanent injunction against the defendants, enjoining them from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint; disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, derived from the unlawful insider trading activity set forth in this Complaint, together with prejudgment interest; and a civil penalty pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u-1] and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988.  In addition, the Commission seeks any other relief the Court may deem appropriate pursuant to Section 21(d)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(5)]. Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 2 of 13 3  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Exchange Act Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. 6. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Exchange Act Sections 21(d), 21A, and 27 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u-1, and 78aa].  Hanratty resides and works in the District of Connecticut, and many of the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred within the district. DEFENDANTS 7. Katherine M. Hanratty, age 65, is a resident of Watertown, Connecticut.  Hanratty co-owns a Connecticut-based staffing agency.  Hanratty has been romantically involved with Carr since approximately 2011. 8. Robert O. Carr, age 73, is a resident of New London, New Hampshire.  Carr founded Heartland in 1996 and was its CEO until the company™s acquisition by Global in April 2016.  Carr has been Hanratty™s romantic partner since approximately 2011. RELEVANT ENTITY 9. Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. was a Delaware company with a principal place of business in Princeton, New Jersey.  It was in the business of payment processing.  Heartland became an SEC-reporting company in 2005.  On December 15, 2015, Global, a Georgia-based payment technology company with a principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia, announced that it would acquire Heartland for approximately $4.3 billion.  Global has been an SEC-reporting company since 2001 and Global completed its acquisition of Heartland on April 25, 2016.      Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 3 of 13 4   STATEMENT OF FACTS A. Carr/Hanratty Relationship 10. In 2011 Carr and Hanratty began a romantic relationship.  Carr and Hanratty communicated frequently.  They often traveled together, visiting family and friends.  Hanratty also occasionally accompanied Carr on business trips and he routinely confided to her regarding his work.  Hanratty was also in frequent communication with Carr™s family and friends. 11. Over time, Hanratty repeatedly expressed concern to Carr regarding her financial security.  In March of 2015, while on vacation together in Mexico, Carr offered to give Hanratty some money for her financial security.  Hanratty rejected Carr™s offer at the time, but it remained a topic of conversation between them at least through the end of 2015. B. Carr Provided Hanratty with Material Nonpublic Information, which Hanratty Uses to Purchase Heartland Shares. 12. On or about October 15, 2015, while attending a conference, the CEO of Global approached Carr to request a meeting to discuss Global™s potential acquisition of Heartland.   13. On or about November 9, 2015, Carr and Global™s CEO met in person in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss the possibility of a strategic combination between Heartland and Global.  On the morning of November 9, 2015, Hanratty emailed Carr stating: ﬁHave a good meeting with Global!ﬂ   14.  Later on November 9, 2015, Carr emailed Hanratty regarding the progress of the negotiations, stating that the meeting with the Global CEO had been ﬁgoodﬂ and that the offer price was $97.50 per share of Heartland stock, a premium to the then current trading price.  In the email Carr also informed Hanratty that he thought the proposed acquisition of Heartland would close in mid-December 2015.  She replied in a return email: ﬁWow quite an offer.ﬂ  Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 4 of 13 5  15. On November 10, 2015, at a regularly scheduled Heartland board of directors meeting, Carr informed the board of the discussions with the Global CEO regarding a merger and received authorization to continue the discussions.    16. Subsequently, during the afternoon of November 10, 2015, Carr discussed with Heartland™s investment advisors a potential script for a phone call with Global™s CEO, planned for at 9:30 am on November 11, 2015.  Among the topics identified in the script were the following: 1) Heartland board™s interest in Global potentially acquiring Heartland; 2) the need that the offer would have to be in the $100 per share range (a 30% premium over the current price per share of Heartland stock); and 3) time and certainty was a necessity so Heartland wanted a deal before Christmas.   17. Later that day Hanratty emailed Carr hoping that the board of directors meeting was ﬁgood.ﬂ  Carr responded via email that the board of directors meeting had been good.  Hanratty in turn responded via email that she was ﬁ[g]lad it went well.ﬂ  18. On November 11, 2015, Carr spoke by telephone with Global™s CEO.  After the phone call, Global™s CEO emailed Carr indicating that he had spoken to Global™s Chairman of the Board and wanted to meet on Friday, November 20, 2015 in Toronto, Canada to continue discussions.  Global™s CEO informed Carr that he was bringing Global™s Chief Financial Officer (ﬁCFOﬂ) and President to the meeting.  Finally, Global™s CEO requested that Carr bring Heartland™s CFO and its President of the Strategic Markets Group. 19. By November 13, 2015, in preparation for the planned November 20, 2015, meeting with Global, Heartland™s investment banking firm had provided an analysis to Carr to determine the implications of a potential acquisition of Heartland by Global, including its effects on Global going forward. Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 5 of 13 6  20. On or about November 15, 2015, Carr provided Hanratty with a check drawn from his personal checking account dated November 16, 2015 for $1 million.  Carr wrote ﬁloanﬂ in the memo section of the check. 21. Later on November 15, 2015, Hanratty emailed herself a to-do list that included ﬁHPY,ﬂ the stock ticker symbol for Heartland, and conducted internet searches on how to buy stock.  22. On November 17, 2015, Hanratty went to her local bank branch and deposited the $1 million check into her checking account.  During that visit she inquired of the bank manager as to how to open a brokerage account.   23. On November 17, 2015, Hanratty emailed Carr and stated that she had made arrangements to ﬁpurchase the HPY [Heartland] stock as soon as the out of state check clears.ﬂ  In her email she also informed Carr that ﬁI am following your advice to the letter and keeping the amount you suggested in a saving [sic] account for now.ﬂ 24. On November 18, 2015, Hanratty opened a brokerage account with a broker-dealer firm that she was referred to by her local bank and then wrote a check to the brokerage firm for $900,000 to fund the account.  She stated in her brokerage account opening paperwork that she owned no securities as of the opening of the brokerage account.  In her brokerage account opening paperwork, Hanratty also stated that the source of her funds was a ﬁgiftﬂ and she listed Carr as the beneficiary of the brokerage account upon her death.  In fact, while in the midst of opening her brokerage account, Hanratty emailed Carr requesting his social security number to allow her to name him as a beneficiary.   Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 6 of 13 7  25. In communications with her broker while opening the brokerage account, Hanratty stated that she felt obligated to purchase Heartland stock because she received the gifted money from the owner of the company. 26.  Later on November 18, 2015, Hanratty emailed Carr that she had become a shareholder of Heartland.  In a reply email, Carr thanked Hanratty for the purchase.  In her subsequent email reply to Carr, Hanratty informed Carr that she had purchased 8,500 shares of Heartland stock and intended to obtain additional shares the next day.   27. On November 18, 2015, Hanratty purchased 8,500 shares of Heartland stock at $78.84 per share.  On November 19, 2015, she bought an additional 2,500 shares at $78.88 per share.  Finally on November 23, 2015, she purchased an additional 393 shares for $79.49 per share.  In total, between November 18, 2015, and November 23, 2015, Hanratty purchased 11,393 shares of Heartland stock for $899,852 for an average cost of $78.98 per share. 28. In the midst of Hanratty™s purchases of Heartland shares, on November 19, 2015, after a conversation between Carr and the Global CEO, the two companies entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement Œ an agreement by the companies to keep information confidential during Global™s due diligence of Heartland™s financial condition prior to an acquisition.   29. On November 20, 2015 the Heartland and Global management teams met so that Global could start its due diligence investigation, a common business practice that, in this situation, would involve one company taking steps to research and analyze another company it is considering acquiring.   30. On November 21, 2015, during a trip to Chicago for Carr™s 70th birthday party with Hanratty and members of Carr™s family, Carr announced to his children and their spouses that an Atlanta-based company named Global had offered to buy Heartland and that he would Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 7 of 13 8  not sell Heartland to Global unless the offer had a ﬁ1ﬂ in the price, implying that he wanted at least $100 per share.   31. On November 23, 2015, Hanratty emailed Carr to express her gratitude and stated ﬁfor the first time ever I feel a sense of relief knowing that I have some security.ﬂ  Referring to the $1 million, Hanratty repeated that ﬁI have done exactly what you recommended I do with it and made you the beneficiary of the account.ﬂ  Carr replied via email that he was glad that she was not so stressed anymore. 32. On November 24, 2015, Global sent a preliminary letter proposal to Heartland offering $97.50 per share to acquire Heartland, the same price in Carr™s email to Hanratty two-weeks earlier.   33. Negotiations between Heartland and Global continued and on December 10, 2015, multiple news organizations publicly reported that the two companies were negotiating an acquisition and that a deal was likely.   34. On that day, after the news reports, Heartland™s stock price increased by $6.95 per share (8.93%) to close at $84.79 per share.  Although the news reports did not reveal any pricing or deal terms, Heartland and Global nevertheless decided to accelerate the acquisition discussions as a result of the reports. 35. Between December 12 and December 14, 2015, Hanratty repeatedly emailed Carr about his ﬁcrazy busyﬂ preparations at Heartland.  On December 13, Carr emailed Hanratty his draft quote to be used for the press release of the pending acquisition.  Just minutes later, she replied ﬁlove itﬂ and provided a suggestion for the draft quote. 36. On December 15, 2015, after the close of trading of the securities markets, Heartland and Global announced that they had entered into a merger agreement whereby Global Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 8 of 13 9  would acquire Heartland in a cash-and-stock transaction for $100.00 per share.  The public announcement prompted Heartland™s stock price to increase by $9.87 (11%) per share to a price of $94.97 per share by the close of markets the next day. 37. Hanratty held on to her Heartland stock and on January 28, 2016, she emailed her broker stating that Carr had decided to resign from Heartland and she planned to sell her stock. 38.  On April 11, 2016, Hanratty emailed Carr asking for his guidance on when she should sell the Heartland stock.  The very next day, Carr emailed Hanratty that he saw ﬁno reason at allﬂ why she should not sell that day as the stock had risen to $101.37 per share.  Hanratty then emailed Carr that she would sell all of her Heartland stock that day.   39. The next day, Hanratty emailed Carr again, stating that she sold her stock according to Carr™s instructions.  Hanratty sold her 11,393 shares of Heartland at $101.066 per share, for a profit of $250,628 when compared to the prices at which she bought the stock in November 2015.   C. Carr Violated His Duty to Heartland by Tipping Hanratty as to Material, Nonpublic Information. 40. Heartland™s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (ﬁthe Codeﬂ) explicitly prohibited all employees from trading in securities or other types of property based on knowledge derived from their employment.  The Code stated that ﬁ[i]t is also illegal to give tips to others which [sic] allow them to trade securities and property using such ‚insider information.™ﬂ  We follow these laws strictly and without exception.ﬂ  Finally, the Code required Carr to read carefully ﬁHeartland™s Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securitiesﬂ (ﬁInsider Trading Policyﬂ).  41. The Insider Trading Policy specifically stated that no officer ﬁwho is aware of material nonpublic information relating to [Heartland] may (a) buy or sell securities of the Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 9 of 13 10  Company –or engage in any other action to take personal advantage of that information, or (b) pass that information on to others outside the Company including family, friends, and acquaintances.ﬂ 42. The Insider Trading policy provided detailed examples of material nonpublic information including ﬁ[a] pending or proposed merger, acquisition, tender offer or other corporate consolidation or restructuring transaction.ﬂ  Further, the policy warned that the Commission has successfully prosecuted cases against employees ﬁtrading by family members and friends.ﬂ 43. Carr, as the CEO of Heartland, was subject to its insider trading policy.  On information and belief, Carr was required to certify in writing that he had read and complied with the policy on a regular basis.   44. Information regarding Global™s potential acquisition of Heartland, which Carr obtained as a result of his employment as CEO of Heartland, was not publicly disseminated prior to December 10, 2015 news reports.  In fact, both Heartland and Global had mutually agreed to keep the information strictly confidential.   45. The information regarding the potential acquisition of Heartland by Global was material.  A reasonable investor would have viewed this information as being important to his or her investment decision or a significant alteration of the total mix of information made available to the public about Heartland™s stock. 46. By providing Hanratty the material, nonpublic information about the potential acquisition of Heartland and the funding to trade Heartland™s stock, Carr violated the company™s Code, which ﬁstrictlyﬂ prohibited giving ﬁtips to others which allow them to trade securities and Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 10 of 13 11  property using – ‚insider information.™ﬂ More generally, Carr breached his duty to the shareholders of Heartland.   47. Carr knew or recklessly disregarded that tipping Hanratty was in breach of a fiduciary duty he owed to Heartland and its shareholders. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF  Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  48. The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 47 above. 49. The information described in the Complaint was material and nonpublic and was considered by Heartland to be confidential.  Heartland had policies and procedures protecting confidential information. 50. Carr learned of the material nonpublic information described in the Complaint during the course of his employment as CEO of Heartland and had an obligation to protect the confidentiality of that information, as well as a fiduciary duty not to misuse such information for personal gain to himself or others. 51. Carr tipped Hanratty to trade in the stock of Heartland based on the material nonpublic information in exchange for a direct or indirect personal benefit. 52. Hanratty knew or should have known that Carr breached his duty to Heartland and its shareholders when she traded in the stock of Heartland while in the possession of material nonpublic information.   53. As alleged herein, Carr and Hanratty directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, by the use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, intentionally, knowingly or recklessly:  (a) employed or Case 3:18-cv-01135   Document 1   Filed 07/10/18   Page 11 of 13 12  are employing devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; (b) made or are making untrue statements of material fact or omitted or is omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and/or (c) engaged or are engaging in acts, practices or courses of business which operate as a fraud or deceit upon other persons. 54. By reason of the foregoing, Carr and Hanratty have violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5].   PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court enter a Final Judgment:  A. Permanently restraining and enjoining Carr and Hanratty from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder; B.

Carr provided his longtime girlfriend, Katherine M. Hanratty, with confidential information about a potential acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. by another payment processing company. In the weeks leading up to the merger announcement, Carr allegedly gave Hanratty $1 million to open a brokerage account and instructed her to use almost all of the funds to purchase Heartland stock. The SEC alleges that Hanratty followed Carr's instructions, opening the account and purchasing more than 11,000 shares of Heartland stock. After the merger was announced, Heartland's stock price rose substantially, and Hanratty allegedly sought Carr's advice about when to sell the stock. Hanratty ultimately liquidated her entire position in a single day, earning substantial profits on the sale.The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges Carr and Hanratty with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The SEC's complaint further seeks to bar Carr from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-reporting company.The SEC's case is being handled by Xinyue Angela Lin, Deena Bernstein, and Paul G.

Matthews also met with sales agents, investors, and prospective investors multipletimes regarding the Hotel project.C. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions to PHH Investors1. MisaDnropriation of Investor Funds bv Walsh. PHH. SARC. andMatthews27. Between November 2012 and at least December 2014, the offering materialsmisrepresented that investor funds would be loaned to Palm House to acquire, develop andoperate the Hotel. In reality, PHH, SARC, and Walsh misappropriated approximately$ 13,578,000 of investor funds. First, Walsh kept at least $8,078,000 of investor funds earmarkedfor the Hotel project. Walsh co-mingled these funds with other funds he controlled for his ownuse and to pay expenses unrelated to the Hotel project. Second, in December 2013, Walshloaned Matthews at least $5.5 million of investor funds to save Matthews' personal Palm Beach,Florida mansion from foreclosure. The loan, which was undocumented, was never disclosed toinvestors. In March 2014, Matthews sent Walsh an email expressing his ""gratitude"" for Walsh""saving [his] house.""28. Between approximately June 2014 and December 2014, Matthewsmisappropriated at least $3.4 million of investor funds to obtain title for and pay expenses-8-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 8 of 18 associated with a 151-foot yacht and a piece of property located next to the Hotel. Both weretitled in the names of entities owned and controlled by a member of Matthews' family.Matthews' use of investor funds in this manner was neither permitted by the olTering materialsnor disclosed to investors.29. Between February 2014 and June 2014, Matthews also directed the transfer ofapproximately $4.5 million of investor funds that, through a series of transactions, were used topurchase his former home in Connecticut out of foreclosure and for other related expenses.Matthews then extracted $1.2 million from the Connecticut home through a business purposeloan secured by the property, from which he and his family received $825,000.2. Misrenrcsentations Regarding Escrow RcQuiremcnts and the Returnof Investor Funds30. Between November 2012 and at least June 2014, PHH's offering materialscontained material misrepresentations regarding PHH's use of an escrow account for investorfunds. PHH falsely and fraudulently claimed that investor funds would be held in an escrowaccount at PNC Bank, pursuant to an escrow agreement between PHH, SARC, and PNC Bank,through at least the filing of the investor's 1-526 petition. Contrary to these representations, noescrow account even existed for investor funds. Prior to the PHH offering, the former CFO forSARC and USREDA informed Walsh that the account receiving investor funds would not evenbe administered by PNC Bank.31. PHH's offering materials also contained material misrepresentations regarding thereturn of funds paid by investors. PFIH's PPMs falsely and fraudulently stated that if aninvestor's 1-526 petition were denied by the USCIS for reasons ""within the control"" of PHH, theinvestor's funds would be returned without deduction. The offering materials and SARC's ownwebsite also falsely, fraudulently, and repeatedly stated that investors' funds would be returned if-9-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 9 of 18 their 1-526 petitions were denied generally or without ""cure."" For example, the brochures slatedthat ""[USREDA] and South Atlantic Regional Center offers a 100% Full Refund of all fees andinvestment if your 1-526 is not approved."" Some of these documents and SARC's websitefalsely and fraudulently referred to the promise of a return of the funds as a money back""guarantee.""32. PHH, SARC, and Walsh knew or recklessly disregarded that USREDA andSARC would not be able to repay investors whose petitions were denied because theymisappropriated for their own use millions of dollars of investor funds, and never escrowedinvestor funds prior to their release to Palm House. To date, the USCIS has denied all of theinvestor 1-526 petitions except one, for which it has issued a Notice of Intent to Deny. TheUSCIS denied the 1-526 petitions because, among other reasons, investors failed to demonstratethat the Hotel project would create sufficient jobs given the uncertainty of the project's future.PHH never returned any money to investors.3. Misrcnrcscntations and Omissions Regarding Walsh and Matthews*Backgrounds33. PHH's PPMs and business plans contained misrepresentations and omissionsregarding the backgrounds of Walsh and Matthews, who are both described in a section on""Management."" The description of Walsh's background, which he drafted, stated that he ""hasextensive experience in merger and acquisition strategy and law"" and experience with ""theintricacies of U.S. Securities and Exchange laws."" Walsh did not have any such merger andacquisition or securities law experience.34. Matthews was described as the chairman of Matthews Ventures Holdings, LLC(""MVH""), a diversified holding company with interests in, among other things, real estate,hotels, and construction. However, PHH's PPMs and business plans materially omitted that in-10-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 10 of 18 2009, one of Matthews' companies, PB Realty Holdings LLC, was placed into involuntarybankruptcy with subcontractors obtaining approximately $2 million in judgments againstMatthews, and that Matthews had lost to foreclosure both his own home, as well as the veryHotel in which investors were purportedly investing. Matthews provided his biography to the in-house counsel for inclusion in the PPMs.35. The offering materials also included a section on G. Matthews but did not disclosethat he was a nominee for Matthews in the ownership of the Hotel because of Matthews'financial problems, a material omission. Walsh knew G. Matthews was a nominee for Matthewsbecause of Matthews' financial problems.4. Other Misrepresentations to PHH investors36. PHH's offering materials also materially misrepresented the conditions underwhich investor funds would be loaned to Palm House. In particular, the PPMs stated, ""it shall bea condition of each advance that as of such time there shall not have been a material adversechange in the operations, assets or financial condition of the [bjorrower and its subsidiaries,taken as a whole."" The loan documents made similar representations and stated that thedetermination as to material adverse changes would be made by PHH. Walsh and PHHŠwhichloaned at least $30,413,462 of investor funds to Palm HouseŠnever ascertained whether PalmHouse met these pre-conditions for any loan advance.37. Matthews' misappropriation of approximately $7.9 million dollars of investorfunds represented material and adverse changes in the operations, assets, and financial conditionof Palm House, 160 Royal, and the Hotel, all of which he controlled. Despite being granted theauthority by the loan documents to access Palm House's financial statements and the right toinspect its books and records, PHH never exercised this authority.-II-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 11 of 18 38. The offering materials also materially misrepresented that PHH would provideaudited financial statements or other financial information to investors on an annual or quarterlybasis. PHH never prepared audited financial statements and did not provide audited statements,or any other fmancial reports, to investors.39. The offering materials also misrepresented that Palm House would make monthlyinterest payments to PHH on its loan for five years. Palm House did not make any monthlyinterest payments to PHH.40. In order to bolster investor confidence in PHH's securities offering, PHH'sbusiness plans and brochures also made materially misleading statements suggesting that PalmHouse had substantial funds at stake in the Hotel, and that investor funds were only part of analready well-financed development project. Based on information provided in part by Matthews,PHH's business plans falsely and fraudulently represented that Palm House had $22 million inequity in the Hotel, and the brochures fraudulently stated the project was ""very safe"" based inpart on a substantial equity investment from Palm House. In reality. Palm House acquired theHotel on August 30, 2013 through a $27,468,750 mortgage on the Hotel, with no pre-existingequity in the Hotel.D. Relief Defendants41. Matthews controlled 160 Royal and its bank accounts through his control of PalmHouse. During the course of the fraudulent scheme, PHH, Walsh, and SARC advanced millionsof dollars of investor funds to 160 Royal. During this same time period, Matthews divertedmillions of dollars of investor funds from 160 Royal to other accounts he controlled.42. Walsh controlled and was the manager of USREDA, which handled businessactivities and USCIS petition work for PHH and other SARC-associated offerings. USREDA-12-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 12 of 18 received millions of dollars of investor funds which were fraudulently obtained by Walsh and hisentities.VI.

Walsh and Robert V. Matthews defrauded dozens of foreign investors participating in the EB-5 program administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which provides foreign nationals with an opportunity to qualify for permanent U.S. residency by investing in domestic, job-creating projects. According to the SEC's complaint, Walsh raised close to $44 million from foreign investors which, through a loan, was to be used to acquire, develop, and operate a Palm Beach hotel controlled by Matthews. The complaint alleges that Walsh misappropriated more than $13 million of the investor funds and that Matthews misappropriated approximately $8 million, some of which he used to acquire a 151-foot yacht and to purchase his former Connecticut home out of foreclosure. According to the SEC's complaint, Walsh and two companies he controlled - Palm House Hotel LLLP (PHH) and South Atlantic Regional Center, LLC (SARC) - also misled investors about the use of an escrow account that purportedly held investor funds prior to disbursement to the hotel, and about Walsh's and Matthews' backgrounds.The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida, charges Walsh, PHH, and SARC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties. The SEC's complaint also charges Matthews with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and with aiding and abetting PHH, SARC, and Walsh's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.

In addition, venue is proper in this district because Defendant David Harbour resides in this district.   SUMMARY 4. This matter is based on misrepresentations by Defendant David A. Harbour (ﬁHarbourﬂ) concerning the use of investor funds in connection with his fundraising activities.  Between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour, through various entities he managed and controlled, raised money from his friends and business acquaintances by representing to them that their funds would be used to finance various businesses, including an American Indian business entity engaged in high-interest installment lending to consumers.  Instead of directing the money to revenue-generating businesses that could achieve the high returns he promised, Harbour used substantial portions of the invested funds to finance his personal lifestyle and pay off his personal debts.  Harbour ultimately used $1,535,000 of the $2,450,000 that he raised from four investors to pay his personal expenses and pay off his debts. 5. By engaging in this conduct, Harbour violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) and Rule 10b-5(b) promulgated thereunder and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ).

Harbour™s Relevant Business Activities 1. Tribal Lending Entity A 12. In 2014, Harbour, who had long been involved in the ﬁpayday loanﬂ industry, began working with others to develop Tribal Lending Entity A.    13. In August 2014, Harbour, on behalf of his company, Oak Tree, entered into Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 3 of 12  COMPLAINT 4   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728a loan agreement with Tribal Lending Entity A.  The agreement specified that Oak Tree would extend up to $10 million in credit to Tribal Lending Entity A at an annual interest rate not to exceed 16% so that Tribal Lending Entity A could ﬁimplement, operate and maintain its online consumer lending businesses currently in development.ﬂ  Harbour signed the loan agreement as Oak Tree™s ﬁManager.ﬂ  Between August 2014 and October 2015, Oak Tree provided approximately $2.9 million in capital to Tribal Lending Entity A.   14. From its inception in 2014 until late 2016, Harbour was actively involved in Tribal Lending Entity A™s business.  In late 2016, a third party creditor of Tribal Lending Entity A took over the entity™s operations. 2. Other Harbour Ventures 15. Between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour was engaged in other business ventures, including a merchant cash advance business, as well as businesses associated with the same American Indian tribe that related to healthcare and fire-fighting.  Harbour described some of these ventures when seeking to raise money from the four investors.   B. Harbour™s Misrepresentations Regarding Use of Investor Funds 16. Harbour sought to raise money from investors to finance these enterprises, and particularly Tribal Lending Entity A.  Between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour, through four entities he created and controlled, raised money from four individual investors, telling them their investments would be used to finance Tribal Lending Entity A or other revenue-generating businesses, and promising substantial returns.  Instead of using the invested money as represented, Harbour used $1,535,000 of the $2,450,000 raised from these four investors to finance his personal lifestyle and pay off his debts. 1. Investor A 17. In July 2014, Harbour, through Oak Tree, raised $500,000 from a limited liability company controlled by Investor A, a resident of Illinois.  Harbour orally represented to Investor A that the $500,000 would be used solely to finance a consumer Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 4 of 12  COMPLAINT 5   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728installment lending operation to be run by an American Indian tribal entity.   18. Harbour signed the promissory note for $500,000 that Oak Tree issued to Investor A™s LLC and that included 12% annual interest.   19. Harbour was a signatory on the Oak Tree bank account to which Investor A transferred the $500,000 and had control over the money in that account and transfers or withdrawals from the account. 20. Contrary to Harbour™s representations, much of the money invested by Investor A never went to Tribal Lending Entity A or any consumer lending business but instead was used by Harbour to pay his personal living expenses and debts.  For example, days after receiving the $500,000, Harbour wired $35,000 to pay an individual who had loaned him money.  Harbour also spent $144,000 to pay his credit card bills.  The credit card charges included tens of thousands of dollars of Harbour™s personal expenses such as private jets, Disney cruise trips, a visit to Universal Studios, golf tournament tickets, and a roughly $2,300 restaurant bill.  Altogether, Harbour used $310,000 of the $500,000 provided by Investor A in ways that were inconsistent with his representations to Investor A.   2. Investor B 21. In December 2014, Harbour, through his Pujanza entity, raised $1 million from Investor B, a resident of California.    Harbour told Investor B that his $1 million investment would be pooled with other investor funds to finance various businesses connected to Harbour, including a consumer lending operation and a project related to healthcare.  Harbour also promised Investor B that through these investments Investor B would achieve a 20% annual return.  Based on these representations from Harbour, Investor B understood that his money would be invested in revenue-generating businesses, including a consumer lending operation, that would get him the promised high return.   22. Investor B™s investment was structured such that he received a 1% membership interest in Pujanza, with Harbour, the ﬁmanaging memberﬂ of Pujanza, Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 5 of 12  COMPLAINT 6   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728retaining a 99% membership interest.  The ﬁFirst Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for Pujanza Management, LLC,ﬂ the only written agreement related to Investor B™s investment, indicated that ﬁ[t]he Company is formed for the purpose of making investments in the form of equity investments or debt investments in various industries.ﬂ   23. Investor B played no role in running Pujanza™s business operations and was relying solely on Harbour™s efforts to achieve profits.   24. As a signatory on the Pujanza bank account, Harbour exercised control over money in that account including Investor B™s $1 million investment.    25. Contrary to his representations to Investor B, Harbour used $650,000 of the $1 million invested by Investor B to finance his personal lifestyle.  For example, within two days of receiving the $1 million from Investor B, Harbour spent $223,000 to pay his credit card bills.  The personal credit card charges related to, among other things, private jets, a Disney cruise vacation, concert tickets, a week-long stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in Orlando, Florida, and daily living expenses for Harbour and his family.  Harbour also used Investor B™s money to pay over $12,000 to a country club and to repay $36,000 to an investor from a prior business venture.   3. Investor C 26. In October 2015, Harbour, through his Oak Tree and Milagro entities, raised $500,000 from Investor C, a resident of Texas.  Harbour orally told Investor C that the $500,000 investment would be used to finance Tribal Lending Entity A™s lending operations and that the returns on the investment would allow Investor C to recover money he had lost in a previous investment to which Harbour was connected.  Harbour sent Investor C marketing presentations for Tribal Lending Entity A and other information about its business, including an opinion letter from a law firm attesting to the legality of Tribal Lending Entity A™s lending operations.   27. Investor C™s investment was structured as a promissory note that also included a loan agreement.  The promissory note executed by Oak Tree and Milagro (and Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 6 of 12  COMPLAINT 7   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728signed by Harbour) stated next to ﬁUse of Proceedsﬂ that ﬁBORROWER [Oak Tree] shall use proceeds under this Note solely for the purpose of lending money to [the American Indian tribe that formed Tribal Lending Entity A].ﬂ  The loan agreement similarly stated that the purpose of the loan was for Oak Tree and Milagro ﬁto implement, operate and maintain [their] commercial lending business to [Tribal Lending Entity A].ﬂ  The promissory note issued by Oak Tree and Milagro to Investor C provided for an annual return of 15%.  Harbour also personally guaranteed Investor C™s $500,000 investment.   28. Investor C was relying solely on the efforts of Harbour to achieve a return on his investment and played no role in the operations of Oak Tree, Milagro, or Tribal Lending Entity A.   29. Harbour was a signatory on the Oak Tree bank account to which Investor C transferred his $500,000 and had control over the money in that account and transfers or withdrawals from the account. 30. Contrary to his representations to Investor C, Harbour used $275,000 of Investor C™s $500,000 investment on personal expenses that had no connection to Tribal Lending Entity A or any revenue-generating businesses.  Harbour used investor funds to pay off substantial personal credit card statements, this time spending about $70,000 of Investor C™s money to pay off a single monthly statement that included charges for personal expenses including restaurant meals, groceries, clothing, private jets, stays at resorts, and significant payments to a university™s sports program.  Harbour additionally sent roughly $90,000 to the account of an entity associated with one of his family members.  He also used the funds to pay for golf clubs, life insurance premiums, car payments, and to make a small interest payment to Investor B.   4. Investor D 31. Between August 2015 and August 2016, Harbour, through the Highpointe entity, raised $450,000 from Investor D, a resident of Arizona.  Harbour orally presented Investor D with various business ideas and promised that his investment would be pooled with other investor proceeds to be put into revenue-generating businesses, including Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 7 of 12  COMPLAINT 8   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728lending and healthcare related projects.  Harbour also sent Investor D a presentation describing Tribal Lending Entity A™s business and encouraged Investor D to reach out to Tribal Lending Entity A™s lawyers to discuss the business.   32. Highpointe issued six promissory notes to Investor D that Harbour signed on behalf of Highpointe.  The promissory notes specified an annual interest rate of 15% with the potential for an additional 5% per year at Harbour™s discretion.  The notes further stated that the money being exchanged constituted a ﬁbusiness loan.ﬂ 33. Investor D was to play no role in any of these businesses and was relying on Harbour™s efforts to achieve a profit so as to be able to pay back Investor D.  34. Harbour was a signatory on the Highpointe bank account to which Investor D transferred his investment funds and had control over the money in that account and transfers or withdrawals from the account. 35. Contrary to his representations to Investor D, Harbour used at least $300,000 of Investor D™s $450,000 investment for personal purposes, including paying off personal debts.  Harbour spent over $80,000 of Investor D™s funds to pay off credit card charges.  These charges included thousands of dollars in purchases at Neiman Marcus, over $17,000 in payments to a residential architecture firm, thousands of dollars on expenses related to a golf tournament, and payments to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, as well as meals at restaurants, groceries, and purchases from Costco, Target, and Amazon.  Harbour additionally used Investor D™s money to take out a cashier™s check for $101,000 that appears unrelated to any business activity.  Harbour also used $50,000 to pay an individual who had invested with him in the past.  36. Harbour™s misrepresentations were material, as the four investors would have considered it important to their investment decisions to know how Harbour was using their funds, as that could directly impact their ability to receive back their principal investments and achieve the high returns that Harbour promised. 37. Harbour acted with scienter.  He knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the representations he made regarding the use of investor funds were false or misleading. Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 8 of 12  COMPLAINT 9   1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272838. In addition, Harbour failed to exercise reasonable care by making materially false and misleading representations about how the investors™ money would be used. 39. During all relevant times, Harbour made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Connection with the Purchase and Sale of Securities Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) (Against Harbour) 40. The SEC realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 39 above. 41. Harbour made false and misleading statements to the investors.  He represented that their money would be used either to specifically finance Tribal Lending Entity A™s operations or more generally to finance other Harbour business ventures.  Despite these representations, Harbour spent over $1.5 million of the invested funds for personal expenses and to pay off his personal debts.  These misrepresentations concerning use of funds were material to the investors. 42. Harbour acted with scienter.  He knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his statements regarding the use of investor funds were false and misleading.  Harbour orally made the statements to the four investors, and he signed on behalf of his entities the agreements and documents evidencing the terms of the investments.  Harbour controlled the bank accounts from which he misappropriated the investor money, as well as the various bank accounts between which investor funds were transferred before he ultimately used them to pay off his personal expenses.  As the person who had made the representations to the investors, Harbour undoubtedly knew or was reckless in not knowing that the manner in which he used the investor funds was inconsistent with what he told the investors.  Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 9 of 12  COMPLAINT 10   1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272843. By engaging in the conduct described above, Harbour, with scienter, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, by the use of means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange, made untrue statements of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   44. By engaging in the conduct described above, Harbour violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5(b). SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in the Offer or Sale of Securities Violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act (Against Harbour) 45. The SEC realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 39 above. 46. Harbour obtained money by means of material misrepresentations to the investors.  As discussed above, based on Harbour™s representations that their money would be used to finance various revenue-generating businesses, the four investors invested $2,450,000 in entities for which Harbour was the sole member and manager.  Harbour, who had control over the entities™ bank accounts, then misappropriated $1,535,000 of the investor funds for his personal expenses, thereby obtaining money by means of his misrepresentations to investors.   47. Harbour acted with scienter and was negligent.  Harbour made the statements to the investors about how their money would be used and controlled the bank accounts from which their funds were misappropriated.  Harbour therefore knew or was negligent in not knowing that his use of investor funds was contrary to what he had represented to the investors. 48. By engaging in the conduct described above, Harbour, directly or Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 10 of 12  COMPLAINT 11   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728indirectly, in the offer or sale of securities, and by the use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails directly or indirectly, obtained money or property by means of untrue statements of a material fact or by omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 49. By engaging in the conduct described above, Harbour violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2). PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, the SEC respectfully requests that the Court: I. Issue findings of fact and conclusions of law that Harbour committed the alleged violations. II. Issue judgments, in forms consistent with Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, permanently enjoining Harbour, and his officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and those persons in active concert or participation with any of them, who receive actual notice of the judgment by personal service or otherwise, and each of them, from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)], and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)]. III. Order Harbour to disgorge all funds received from his illegal conduct, together with prejudgment interest thereon. IV. Order Harbour to pay civil penalties under Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)].

Retain jurisdiction of this action in accordance with the principles of equity and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in order to implement and carry out the terms of all orders and decrees that may be entered, or to entertain any suitable application or motion for additional relief within the jurisdiction of this Court.

Longo Attorney for Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission    Case 2:18-cv-02401-DGC   Document 2   Filed 07/31/18   Page 12 of 12","On July 31, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged David A. Harbour of Scottsdale, Arizona with making misrepresentations to investors and misappropriating over $1.5 million in investor funds to finance his personal lifestyle and pay off his debts.According to the SEC's complaint, between July 2014 and August 2016, Harbour raised money from four friends and business acquaintances by representing to them that their funds would be used to finance various businesses, including an American Indian business entity engaged in high-interest installment lending to consumers. The SEC alleges that Harbour told the investors he would use their money exclusively for revenue-generating businesses, and promised them high annual returns, ranging from 12% to 20%. Instead, the SEC alleges, Harbour diverted substantial portions of the invested funds for personal purposes that included paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal credit card expenses, such as expenses for private jets, cruises, stays at resorts, and a payment to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Harbour also allegedly used the investor money to make payments on personal loans and debts he owed to investors in prior business ventures. Harbour ultimately misappropriated $1,535,000 of the money raised from the four investors.The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the District of Arizona, charges Harbour with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Harbour has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Harbour has agreed to pay a total of $3,167,072, consisting of disgorgement of $1,535,000 plus prejudgment interest of $97,072, and a penalty of $1,535,000. Harbour also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Christopher A. Nowlin and Christopher M. Conte, and supervised by Spencer E. Bendell."

CONTRARIAN INVESTMENTS, LLC,    Defendant.  COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   JURY DEMAND      1. This action alleges violations of the registration requirements of 1 Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. 2 § 77e(a) and 77e(c)] by Defendant Contrarian Investments, LLC (ﬁContrarianﬂ).  3 Contrarian offered and sold unregistered investment contracts that did not qualify 4 for any exemptions in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. 5 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 1 of 9  2 SUMMARY 1 2. In 2015, the Nevada legislature enacted Senate Bill 443 (ﬁNVSB 2 443ﬂ), allowing entities that fulfilled requirements specified in the bill to collect 3 funds from individuals anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, wager 4 those funds on sporting events, and share the wagering profits with the 5 individuals who contributed the funds. 6 3. Such entities, sometimes known as ﬁsports betting funds,ﬂ were 7 described by some (including Contrarian) as functioning like mutual funds. 8 4. Pursuant to NVSB 443, each sports betting fund must keep a Nevada 9 bank account in which it aggregates the funds raised from individuals, which are 10 then used to wager on sporting events. 11 5. Contrarian retained a percentage of any profit generated as a fee.  12 After that fee was subtracted, Contrarian divided the remaining profit pro rata 13 among all the individuals that contributed funds (ﬁClientsﬂ).  Thus, as profits 14 increased or decreased, the fortunes of the Clients and Contrarian rose or fell 15 together. 16 6. Contrarian had an individual who, working alone, decided how the 17 funds would be wagered on sporting events. 18 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 2 of 9  3 7. Contrarian did not file a registration statement complying with 1 Section 5 of the Securities Act in support of its sports betting fund, and did not 2 fulfill the requirements necessary to qualify for an exemption from registration. 3 8. By virtue of this conduct, Contrarian has violated and, unless enjoined, 4 will continue to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. 5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6 9. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and 7 (d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)-(d)] to enjoin Contrarian from 8 engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this 9 Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar 10 purport and object, and for other relief. 11 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 12 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)]. 13 11. Contrarian, directly and indirectly, has made use of the mails, the 14 means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and the means and 15 instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, in 16 connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged 17 in this Complaint.  18 12. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act 19 [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and 20 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 3 of 9  4 courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act have occurred 1 within the District of Nevada.  Contrarian maintains its principal place of 2 business in Las Vegas and the securities have been sold to investors in this 3 district. 4 DEFENDANT 5 13. Contrarian Investments, LLC registered as a Nevada limited 6 liability company on March 7, 2016, and began receiving funds from Clients in 7 April 2016.  Contrarian raised approximately $437,500 from approximately 25 8 investors. 9 FACTS 10 Nevada Senate Bill 443 11 14. Enacted in June 2015, NVSB 443 allows entities Œ sometimes called 12 ﬁsports betting fundsﬂ Œ which fulfill certain requirements specified in the bill, to 13 collect funds from individuals who reside anywhere in the world and use those 14 funds to place wagers on certain sporting events.  15 15. NVSB 443 also allows sports betting funds to share the profits of such 16 wagering with the individuals from whom they have collected money.    17 16. NVSB 443 requires sports betting funds, among other things, to be 18 organized in Nevada and to maintain Clients™ funds in an account at a specified 19 Nevada bank. 20 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 4 of 9  5 Contrarian Investments, LLC 1 17.  Contrarian registered as a limited liability company in Nevada on 2 March 7, 2016.     3 18. Contrarian began receiving funds from Clients for wagering in April 4 2016.  As required by NVSB 443, all Client funds were pooled in the Nevada 5 bank account opened by Contrarian for its sports betting fund. 6 19. Contrarian used a website to inform potential Clients of its willingness 7 to use their combined funds to place wagers and to share the profits.  8 20. Contrarian™s website informed Clients of, among other things, the 9 minimum amount that Contrarian would accept from individual investors, and 10 who at Contrarian to contact if they had questions.  11 21. Contrarian™s website stated that it would collect a ﬁperformance feeﬂ 12 of 20% of ﬁreturns generated.ﬂ  That fee was to be calculated at the end of each 13 sports season during which Contrarian placed wagers.  The remaining 80% of 14 profit was distributed to the individuals who contributed funds proportionally 15 based on the amount of each individual™s contribution. 16 22. As a limited liability company, Contrarian was controlled and 17 operated by the company™s managing member.  Contrarian™s managing member, 18 working alone, decided how the funds would be wagered on sporting events.  19 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 5 of 9  6 None of Contrarian™s Clients played any role whatsoever in the profit-generating 1 process of placing wagers. 2 23. During its period of operation, Contrarian raised approximately 3 $437,500 for wagering from over 25 individuals located in at least 12 states and 4 Canada. 5 24. Contrarian™s Clients used U.S. mail and electronic bank transfers 6 when submitting their funds. 7 25. Contrarian did not make a determination regarding its Clients™ status 8 as accredited investors as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(15)(ii) of the 9 Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(15)(ii)]. 10 26. Prior to accepting funds, Contrarian did not file a registration 11 statement complying with Section 5 of the Securities Act in support of its sports 12 betting fund, and did not fulfill the requirements necessary to qualify for an 13 exemption from registration. 14 COUNT I Š UNREGISTERED OFFERING OF SECURITIES 15 Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act 16 [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)] 17 27.

No registration statement has been filed or is in effect with the 1 Commission pursuant to the Securities Act for the sports betting fund described 2 herein, and Contrarian did not fulfill the requirements necessary to qualify for an 3 exemption from registration. 4 29. From at least March 2016 through the present, Contrarian has: 5  (a) made use of the means or instruments of transportation or 6 communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell securities, through 7 the use or medium of a prospectus or otherwise; 8  (b) carried securities or caused such securities to be carried through 9 the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or instruments of 10 transportation, for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale; and 11  (c) made use of the means or instruments of transportation or 12 communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to 13 buy securities, through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise,  14 without a registration statement having been filed with the Commission as to 15 such securities. 16 30. By reason of the foregoing, Contrarian, directly and indirectly, has 17 violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 18 77e(c)]. 19 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 7 of 9  8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF 1 WHEREFORE, the SEC respectfully requests that the Court: 2 I. 3  Issue findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52 of the 4 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure finding that Contrarian committed the alleged 5 violations. 6 II. 7  Issue a judgment, in a form consistent with Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules 8 of Civil Procedure, permanently enjoining Contrarian and its officers, agents, 9 servants, employees, and attorneys, and those persons in active concert or 10 participation with them who receive actual notice of the order of injunction, by 11 personal service or otherwise, and each of them, from violating Section 5 of the 12 Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e]. 13 III.  14  Grant such other and further relief as this Court may determine to be just, 15 equitable, and appropriate in connection with the enforcement of the federal 16 securities laws and for the protection of investors. 17 DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 18   Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the SEC 19 demands trial by jury in this action of all issues so triable.  20 Case 2:18-cv-01725   Document 1   Filed 09/07/18   Page 8 of 9  9 Dated this 7th day of September, 2018.

Contrarian was one of a number of organizations formed pursuant to a 2015 Nevada state law that, for the first time, allowed Nevada-based entities to collect and pool money from investors anywhere in the world for purposes of sports wagering. Entities like Contrarian promoted their investment opportunities as functioning like mutual funds.According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of Nevada, in 2015 Nevada passed a law allowing entities to solicit and collect funds from individual investors anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, place wagers on certain sporting events, and split the wagering profits among the investors. In 2016 and 2017, Contrarian raised over $400,000 from more than 30 investors. Contrarian conducted a general solicitation by widely offering its investment opportunity on the internet and further failed to make a determination regarding whether all of its investors were accredited.The Complaint charges Contrarian with conducting an unregistered offering of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission accepted Contrarian's offer of settlement in which, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, it consented to the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requiring it to send a copy of the final judgment to each investor.The SEC's investigation was conducted by William S. Dixon. The case was supervised by Natalie M. Brunson and Aaron W. Lipson, with the litigation overseen by W. Shawn Murnahan and M. Graham Loomis.

During the Relevant Period, Ovations™ common stock met the definition of a ﬁpenny stockﬂ under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(51) [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(51)] and Rule 3a51-1 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240. 3a51-1], in part because the stock traded below five dollars per share.  10.Goldberg, age 61, lives in Middle Village, New York. From at least 2009 through at least June 2015, Goldberg served as Ovations™ CEO or co-CEO. Between 1982 and 2003, Goldberg was associated with various broker-dealers registered with the Commission.   Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 3 4  FACTS 11.During the Relevant Period, Ovations issued at least seven false or misleading press releases about its business.  12.On information and belief, Goldberg, as Ovations™ CEO, generated each of these press releases himself and caused Ovations to issue them.  13.Goldberg did so to fraudulently induce investors to buy shares of Ovations stock so that one or more stock promoters could sell their Ovations shares in the market for a profit.  14.Goldberg knew or recklessly disregarded the falsity or misleading nature of each of these press releases.  15.On information and belief, Goldberg received approximately $250,000 in return from one or more stock promoters at least partly for Goldberg™s role in issuing Ovations™ false or misleading press releases.  A.The Press Releases about Licensing Lung Cancer Detection Technology  16.On June 10, 2014, Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Announces the Licensing of Technology for Early Detection of Lung Cancer.ﬂ 17.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this press release. 18.The press release claimed:  [Ovations] has concluded negotiations for licensing sophisticated sputum cytology technology for early and pre stage detection of lung cancer from Mel Ehrlich, Ph.D., who is also an officer and director of INOH. Dr. Ehrlich has invented, patented, perfected and marketed multiple biomedical and energy efficiency technologies. Pursuant to the license, INOH obtained exclusive rights to market the sputum cytology and related technologies world-wide from Dr. Ehrlich. Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4 5  19.On July 2, 2014, at approximately 9:25 a.m.,1 Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Announces the Immediate Availability of the Early Detection of Lung Cancer Kit.ﬂ 20.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this press release.  21.The press release claimed: [Ovations] is pleased to announce the implementation of the technology using sputum cytology for the early detection of lung cancer, a recognized laboratory procedure similar to the ‚Pap™ test. Mel Ehrlich, Ph.D. stated, ‚I am pleased with the diligent efforts that [Ovations] is implementing with the sputum cytology technology for the early detection of lung cancer.™  22.In reality, Dr. Ehrlich never served as an officer or director of Ovations, as Goldberg knew from his position as Ovations™ CEO.  23.Nor did Ovations ever provide any funding to Dr. Ehrlich under its licensing agreement in order to obtain rights to his technology, as Goldberg similarly knew.  24.On June 30 and July 1, 2014, the two days before Ovations issued its July 2 press release, and on July 2, 2014, no shares of Ovations™ common stock traded in the market.   25.On July 3, 2014, the day after Ovations issued the press release, approximately 9.95 million Ovations shares traded in the market.  B.The Press Releases about Acquiring a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary 26.Less than seven months later, on January 20, 2015, at approximately 8:50 a.m., Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Acquires NBE Financial Network, Inc. With Close to 1 Million Dollars in Annual Revenues Through Management of Several Locations in Four States.ﬂ                                                            1  All times alleged in this Complaint reflect Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Time.  Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 5 6  27.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this press release. 28.The press release claimed:  [Ovations] has acquired NBE Financial Network, Inc. (NBE) as a wholly owned subsidiary. With nearly $1 million dollars in revenues in 2014, NBE™s acquisition by INOH continues the trend of the company™s diversification and augments its current holdings with a strong revenue generating network. NBE, managing established offices in Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois, is engaged in the operation and management of law offices in these multiple states and is also engaged in the acquisition and management of residential properties. 29.The press release also quoted Goldberg:  Mark Goldberg, INOH Co-CEO added, ‚–In seeking out this relationship and ultimately acquiring NBE as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we consistently kept in mind the feedback from our valued shareholders. By acquiring NBE, a company with nearly $1 million dollars in revenues and a presence in multiple metropolitan areas, we have augmented INOH™s holdings in order to balance active, present value with our other holdings of strong future potential.™ 30.In reality, Ovations never acquired NBE Financial Network, Inc. (ﬁNBEﬂ) and NBE never became Ovations™ subsidiary, as Goldberg knew from his position as Ovations™ CEO. 31.On January 16, 2015, the last trading day before Ovations issued its January 20 press release, approximately 74 million shares of Ovations™ common stock traded in the market.  32.On January 20, 2015, the day Ovations issued that press release, almost four times as manyŠover 275 millionŠOvations shares traded in the market.  33.On March 16, 2015, at approximately 9:40 a.m., Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc.™s Wholly-Owned Subsidiary NBE Financial Network, Inc. Reports Substantial Increases in Revenue.ﬂ 34.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this press release. Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 6 7  35.The press release claimed: ﬁ[Ovations™] wholly-owned subsidiary NBE Financial Network, Inc. (NBE) reports revenues of $80,335 for February, 2015, an increase of 31%.ﬂ  36.On March 13, 2015, the trading day immediately before Ovations issued its March 16 press release, approximately 47 million shares of Ovations™ common stock traded in the market.  37.On March 16, 2015, the day Ovations issued the press release, over 76 million Ovations shares traded in the market.  38.The next day, Ovations™ trading volume doubled to more than 155 million shares traded.  C.The Press Release about Acquiring an Interest in a Multimedia Company 39.On March 26, 2015, at approximately 9:26 a.m., Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. Announces Expansion Into Multimedia Production, Network TV Programs, and Advertising Œ Marketing Services.ﬂ 40.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this press release. 41.The press release claimed: ﬁ[Ovations] has acquired a substantial interest in ASAP Multimedia (ASAP). Since 1987, ASAP has been a leading full service television, web, multimedia and production company and creative agency.ﬂ  42.From his position as Ovations™ CEO and his discussions with ASAP™s president, Goldberg knew that Ovations had never acquired an ownership interest in ASAP. Indeed, Goldberg knew that, in approximately March 2015, Ovations had entered into an agreement with ASAP by which Ovations would obtain an interest in ASAP in the future upon Ovations™ fulfillment of certain conditions and that Ovations had not in fact fulfilled those conditions.  43.On March 25, 2015, the day before Ovations issued this press release, approximately 64 million shares of Ovations™ common stock traded in the market.  Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 7 8  44.On March 26, 2015, the day Ovations issued the press release, over 71.8 million Ovations shares traded in the market.  45.The next day, Ovations™ trading volume almost doubled to more than 130 million shares traded.  46.When ASAP™s president discovered and read Ovations™ March 26 press release, he told Goldberg that ASAP wanted no further association with Ovations.  D.The Press Releases About the Tank Farm  47.On June 10, 2015, at approximately 9:23 a.m., Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. (INOH) Enters Into Letter of Intent on Acquisition of 7.5 Million Gallon Tank Farm Calculated to Value Over $13,000,000 and to Yield Revenues of $1.8 Million Dollars per Year.ﬂ 48.On information and belief, Goldberg generated and caused Ovations to issue this press release. 49.The press release claimed: [Ovations] and 2 Lisa Court Corporation executed a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the purchase and rehabilitation of the Meridian Mid Continent Tank Farm and Terminal (hereinafter ‚Tank Farm™) located in Meridian, Mississippi. The Tank Farm–, after rehabilitation, will produce an approximate income in excess of $1,800,000 per year and possess a total property/project value of between $13,000,000 and $14,000,000.   50.The press release also announced Goldberg™s resignation as co-CEO.  51.On June 25, 2015, at approximately 8:54 a.m., Ovations issued a press release entitled ﬁIn Ovations Holdings, Inc. (INOH) Executes Purchase and Sale Contract on Acquisition of 7.5 Million Gallon Tank Farm Calculated to Value Over $13,000,000 and to Yield Revenues of $1.8 Million per Year.ﬂ   Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8 9  52.This press release similarly claimed: [Ovations] and 2 Lisa Court Corporation executed a formal Purchase and Sale Agreement for the purchase and rehabilitation of the Meridian Mid Continent Tank Farm and Terminal (hereinafter ‚Tank Farm™) located in Meridian, Mississippi. The Tank Farm–, after rehabilitation, will produce an approximate income in excess of $1,800,000 per year and possesses a total property/project value of between $13,000,000 and $14,000,000. As previously disclosed, 2 Lisa Court Corporation has already committed to provide up to 50% seller financing to [Ovations] on the approximately 20 acre site. Additional financing is expected to come from private offerings and a traditional bank-financed real estate loan.  53.The press release further claimed: ﬁ[W]e are pleased to announce that [Ovations] has welcomed Mr. Ted Doukas [the owner of 2 Lisa Court Corporation] to its Board of Directors. Mr. Doukas is a recognized corporate turn-around specialist and [Ovations] looks forward to receiving his input and expert advice.ﬂ 54.In fact, although Goldberg had spoken with Ted Doukas about Ovations™ potential purchase of a Mississippi tank farm (for oil storage) owned by 2 Lisa Court, Goldberg never asked Doukas to serve on Ovations™ Board of Directors, and Doukas never agreed to do so.  55.Goldberg thus knew that Doukas had never agreed to join and indeed never joined Ovations™ Board of Directors.  56.Furthermore, on information and belief, Ovations had no reasonable basis for the tank farm income and valuation projections contained in the June 10 and June 25 press releases. 57.On June 9, 2015, the day before Ovations issued the June 10 press release, approximately 37 million shares of Ovations traded.  58.On June 10, 2015, the day Ovations issued that press release, almost eight times as many Ovations sharesŠover 293 million sharesŠtraded.   59.On June 24, 2015, the day before Ovations issued the June 25 press release, only 580,000 Ovations shares traded.  Case 1:18-cv-05026   Document 1   Filed 09/05/18   Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 9 10  60.On June 25, 2015, the day Ovations issued that press release, 346 times as manyŠover 200 million Ovations sharesŠtraded.  61.When Doukas learned of Ovations™ June 25 press release, he complained to Goldberg that the press release was false. Goldberg claimed that it was a mistake and did not say anything to Doukas to give him the impression that Goldberg was no longer involved with Ovations.  62.On October 27, 2015, Ovations issued an ﬁAnnual Report Œ Financial Statementsﬂ that appeared on OTC Link™s website: the first financial report Ovations issued on that website after Ovations™ June 25, 2015 press release.  63.The annual report listed Goldberg as Ovations™ chief financial officer, secretary, and director and disclosed that Goldberg ﬁserved as CEO since April 2009 and was appointed to the Board of Directors effective May 1, 2010.ﬂ  64.The report did not mention Goldberg™s resignation as Ovations™ CEO.  65.Goldberg™s certification and electronic signature, as chief financial officer, appeared on the annual report.

Case No.     COMPLAINT    Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges: SUMMARY 1. Defendants Leroy ﬁLeeﬂ K. Young and Young Capital Management LLC (ﬁYCMﬂ) orchestrated the fraudulent and unregistered sale of securities.  From January 2013 through December 2017, Defendants illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.1   Page 1 of 9   1   123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282. Young falsely represented that he would use the investors™ money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund, when in reality he simply spent the investors™ money on personal expenses.  Young also falsely told investors that he would pay the promised returns from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings, which never occurred.   Young said that he could generate returns of ten times investors™ principal investment in sixty days.  To date, Young has not paid his investors the promised returns nor returned any of their principal investments. 3. By engaging in this conduct, Defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ), Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The SEC brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. 5. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 6. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and course of business alleged in this complaint. 7. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)] because certain of the offers and sales of securities and certain of the acts and transactions constituting the violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this Complaint occurred within this district.  In addition, Defendants inhabit and transact business in this district.  Specifically, Defendant Young resides in Solano Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.2   Page 2 of 9   2   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Beach, California, and Defendant YCM™s principal place of business is in Carlsbad, California. THE DEFENDANTS 8. Defendant Leroy ﬁLeeﬂ K. Young of Solana Beach, California is the sole member and owner of YCM.  Since 2014, Young™s only employment and source of income has been raising money from investors.  Young is not currently registered or associated with any entity registered with the Commission. 9. Defendant Young Capital Management, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Carlsbad, California.  YCM has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. STATEMENT OF FACTS 10. From January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM obtained a total of at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme that included material misrepresentations and other deceptive conduct.  Young and YCM sold investors securities and falsely promised investors a return of ten times their initial investment in sixty days.     11. Young and YCM broadly solicited investors from multiple states through, among other means, emails, phone calls, and the Internet.  Young identified one investor using the social network LinkedIn.  The majority of Young™s investors were referred to him by two individuals who also invested personally.  Young did not ask potential investors about their income, net worth, or prior investment experience.   12. To induce individuals to invest, Young knowingly or recklessly made numerous materially false statements in telephone conversations and e-mails.  Young promised investors a return of ten times their principal in sixty days.  Young told investors that he would use their money for legal fees or other expenses associated with a bond or hedge fund offering (which he sometimes called the ﬁYoung Capital Management Bondﬂ or ﬁYoung Capital Managementﬂ fund), and that he would pay investors™ returns from the proceeds of the offering.  In fact, Young never conducted Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 9   3   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728a bond or hedge fund offering.  Instead, Young spent nearly all of the investors™ funds on personal expenses, such as dining, shopping, and entertainment.   13. Young further lied to investors about the bond or hedge fund offering.  He falsely claimed to investors that he had partnered with large broker-dealers to conduct the offering.  In fact, Young never partnered with any broker-dealer in connection with any securities offering.   14. Young also frequently told potential investors that he had extensive experience with the type of investment he was offering and that it could not fail.  These statements were false and misleading because Young had no prior experience conducting bond or hedge fund offerings. 15. For example, on August 12, 2016, Young met with Investor A.  Young told Investor A that he was raising money to pay legal fees for a $100 million bond offering called the ﬁYoung Capital Management Bond.ﬂ  Young identified three large broker-dealers as ﬁadministrators of the bond.ﬂ  Young told Investor A that if he invested $20,000, he would receive a return of $200,000 in sixty days.  Young said that Investor A™s principal would be held in an escrow account and would be returned to him if the bond offering did not occur.  Young also told Investor A that he had done many of these types of bond offerings in the past. 16. In another example, on June 23, 2017, Young spoke with Investor B over the phone.  Young told Investor B that he had recently left a large broker-dealer and was conducting bond offerings with his former colleagues.  Young told Investor B that if he invested $5,000, he would receive a return of $50,000 in sixty days. 17. After soliciting their investments through material misrepresentations, Young provided contracts to each investor.  The contracts also falsely stated that investors would receive a ten times return on their investment in sixty days ﬁin regard to a transaction or transactions,ﬂ without further explanation.  For example, for one individual who invested $15,000, the agreement stated:  ﬁClient will be paid $150,000 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) in sixty (60) days in regard to a Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.4   Page 4 of 9   4   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728transaction or transactions.ﬂ 18. Young™s promise of ﬁten timesﬂ returns in sixty days was false.  Young did not provide investors with any returns within sixty days of their investments and knew or was reckless in not knowing that these representations were false at the time that he made them.  Such returns would have been impossible because, rather than investing investors™ funds in any security that could have potentially provided a return, Young simply spent the money on himself.  To date, Young has not returned any money to investors.     19. Based on Young™s (and through Young, YCM™s) material misrepresentations, investors agreed to invest in securities that took the form of investment contracts.  Sales of securities must be registered with the SEC unless an exemption from the registration requirements applies. 20. During all relevant times, Young™s and YCM™s offering of investment contracts was required to be registered under the securities laws.  Young and YCM™s offering was not registered with the SEC and was not subject to any relevant exemption from registration. 21. Young and YCM obtained $362,000 from investors by means of their materially false statements and the illegal, unregistered sales of investment contracts to them.   22. To some investors, Young held himself out as an investment adviser to a purported hedge fund, YCM. 23. Young and YCM engaged in additional deceptive conduct in furtherance of the scheme by funneling investors™ funds through a self-employed attorney working with Young.  Young directed investors to wire their investment funds to a trust account maintained by the attorney.  Young told investors that their principal would safely remain in escrow until the bond or hedge fund offering was complete.   24. Young™s representation that investors™ money would remain in escrow was also false.  At Young™s instruction, the attorney transferred the investors™ money Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.5   Page 5 of 9   5   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728to Young™s personal bank account either on the day of receipt or the next day.  Young then immediately began spending the investors™ money on his personal expenses. 25. Young™s misrepresentations to investors about his relevant experience and industry access, the safety of the investment, and the high returns of the investment were material to investors. 26. When pressed by investors for promised returns, repayment of their initial investment, or status updates on their investments, Young concealed his misappropriation of their money by making more false statements.  Young sent emails to investors stating variously that he was ﬁin a lawsuit to refund [their] money,ﬂ ﬁgetting very close to getting a refund on [their] investment,ﬂ ﬁdoing a 144A Bond Offering in the next 30-60 days which will return 9X your money,ﬂ and ﬁgoing to start selling the bonds [him]self to institutional investorsﬂ in a ﬁbond offering now scheduled for January 8.ﬂ  At the time he made these statements, Young knew that they were false.  In fact, there was no lawsuit, there was no planned bond offering, and Young was never ﬁcloseﬂ to refunding investors™ money. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Fraud in Connection with the Purchase and Sale of Securities Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (Against All Defendants) 27. The SEC realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 26 above. 28. As a result of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants Young and YCM knowingly or recklessly, in the offer or sale of securities, directly or indirectly, by the use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the mails: a. Knowingly or recklessly employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud; b.

Dated:  September 19, 2018 /s/ David Mendel__________________ David Mendel Attorney for Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.9   Page 9 of 9","On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy ""Lee"" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities.The SEC's complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. According to the SEC's complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings. In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments.Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450. The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval. Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock.The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan. According to the SEC's orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young's investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young's antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Emily Shea and supervised by Kevin Guerrero and Antonia Chion."

AMER DEEBA,  Defendant.   Case No. ______________    COMPLAINT        Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ) alleges: SUMMARY 1. This case involves insider trading in the securities of Qualys, Inc. (ﬁQualysﬂ) by Defendant Amer Deeba.  During the first week of April 2015, Deeba, then a senior executive officer at Qualys, learned that the company had missed its internal sales forecast for the first quarter of the fiscal year (ﬁQ1 2015ﬂ).  On April 8, Deeba shared this material nonpublic information with his two brothers, who were Qualys shareholders.  That same day, Deeba contacted his brothers™ broker and helped arrange for the broker to sell all of his brothers™ Qualys shares. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 1 of 7  COMPLAINT  2 CASE NO. ___________ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 2. After the market closed on May 4, 2015, Qualys announced disappointing Q1 2015 financial results.  Qualys revealed that it had missed its Q1 2015 revenue guidance, that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward, and that the growth rate of its largest business segment had declined.  The next day Qualys™s stock price fell 25%.  As a result of Deeba tipping his brothers with material nonpublic information, both brothers sold all of their Qualys shares ahead of the announcement and avoided losses of $456,636 and $124,534, respectively.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 3. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u-1. 4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21A, and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u-1 and 78aa. 5. Defendant Deeba, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and of the mails, and of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein.   6. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, because a substantial part of the acts and transactions constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred within the Northern District of California, and because Defendant Deeba resides or transacts business in the district. INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT 7. Under Civil Local Rule 3-2(d), this civil action should be assigned to the San Francisco Division, because a substantial part of the events which give rise to the claims alleged herein occurred in San Mateo County, and Defendant Deeba resides in San Francisco County. DEFENDANT 8. Amer Deeba is a 51-year-old U.S. citizen residing in San Francisco, California.  He joined Qualys in 2001.  He was Qualys™s Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategic Alliances from 2014 until 2016, when he was promoted to Chief Commercial Officer.  He resigned from the company on August 2, 2018.  At all relevant times, Deeba was a senior executive and a Section 16 officer at Qualys.

Qualys, Inc. is a provider of cloud security, compliance, and related services incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Redwood City, California.  At all relevant times, Qualys™s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) and was quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker QLYS. 10. Brother 1 is an engineer residing in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.  He is Deeba™s older brother and a citizen of Lebanon.   11. Brother 2 is a doctor residing in Beirut, Lebanon.  He is Deeba™s younger brother and a citizen of Lebanon. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Background 12. Deeba worked at Qualys from 2001 to 2018 and was an important member of the company™s leadership team.  His responsibilities included running Qualys™s marketing division, overseeing Qualys™s alliances with its distributors, vetting potential acquisitions, negotiating deals with prominent customers, and assisting with the preparation of the company™s quarterly earnings releases.  During the time period relevant to this action, Deeba was the only senior executive at Qualys with a workstation near Qualys™s CEO, and the two executives spoke frequently. 13. Deeba is close with his two brothers, and he speaks with them often.  Brother 1 provided significant financial assistance to Deeba during college and graduate school.  Deeba in turn provided significant financial assistance to Brother 2 during and after medical school. 14. In 2005, Deeba gifted his brothers Qualys stock.  After Qualys went public in 2012, Deeba arranged for a brokerage firm (the ﬁBrokerage Firmﬂ) to open accounts for each of his brothers to hold their Qualys shares.  The only securities that the brothers™ accounts ever held were the Qualys shares that Deeba had gifted to them in 2005.   Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 3 of 7  COMPLAINT  4 CASE NO. ___________ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 B. Qualys™s Insider Trading Policy 15. In 2012, Deeba received a copy of Qualys™s insider trading policy.  Deeba was aware that he had a duty not to trade Qualys shares on material nonpublic information gained in the course of his employment or share such information with others outside the company who might trade. 16. Qualys™s insider trading policy specifically warned employees that ﬁdisclosing material nonpublic information directly or indirectly to others who then trade based on that information or making recommendations or expressing opinions as to transactions in securities while aware of material nonpublic information (which is sometimes referred to as ‚tipping™) is . . . illegal.ﬂ C. Deeba Tips His Brothers, Who Sell All Their Qualys Stock 17. In early February 2015, Qualys forecasted internally that Q1 2015 sales would be $42.6 millionŠrepresenting 28% year-over-year growth. 18. On February 9, 2015, Qualys publicly announced that it expected Q1 2015 revenue to be between $37.6 million and $38.1 million and that it expected full-year 2015 revenue to be between $167.3 million and $169.3 million.  Qualys derived these public revenue guidance numbers, in substantial part, from the nonpublic sales forecast it had prepared.  At all relevant times, Qualys treated its sales figures as nonpublic, confidential information. 19. Qualys™s internal sales results were material information.  Qualys employees considered the internal sales forecast and internal sales data to be an important metric for the company and often viewed it as a barometer of the business.  For example, Qualys™s former Chief Financial Officer described the company™s sales figures as the company™s ﬁprincipal determinant of revenue.ﬂ  Qualys™s former Vice President of Finance described them as a ﬁleading indicatorﬂ of the health of Qualys™s business. 20. Qualys™s CEO had a practice of sharing quarter-end sales results with Deeba before Qualys announced its results to the market.  For example, after three of the four quarters in 2014, the CEO emailed the quarter-end sales results to Deeba within three days of the end of the quarter.  21. Qualys™s Q1 2015 ended on March 31.  On April 2, Qualys™s Vice President of Finance sent an email to Qualys™s CEO showing that the company had achieved Q1 2015 sales Case 3:18-cv-05346   Document 1   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 7  COMPLAINT  5 CASE NO. ___________ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 growth of 23.6%, representing about $41 million in sales.  This was lower than the internal forecast of $42.6 million, which would have equated to 28% growth.   22. Late in the day on April 7, Deeba spoke with Qualys™s CEO by telephone for twenty minutes.  At the time, Deeba was in Lebanon visiting his family.  Deeba learned of Qualys™s Q1 2015 sales miss during this call. 23. The next day, on April 8, Deeba tipped his brothers about the sales miss.  That morning, he called Brother 1, and the two spoke by telephone for 11 minutes.  Deeba also sent a text message to Brother 2, asking him to give Deeba a call. 24. Later on April 8, just four minutes after the U.S. stock markets opened, Deeba contacted his financial advisor at the Brokerage Firm and told him that he wanted to coordinate trades for his brothers.  Deeba then called Brother 2. 25. A few minutes later, Deeba had a nine-and-a-half-minute telephone call with a broker in the Brokerage Firm™s international group, which was responsible for maintaining Brother 1 and Brother 2™s brokerage accounts.  Immediately after that call ended, the broker with whom Deeba had been speaking placed orders to sell all of Brother 1 and Brother 2™s Qualys stock.  Brother 1 sold 42,164 shares of Qualys stock, and Brother 2 sold 11,499 shares of Qualys stock.  According to the broker, Brother 1 and Brother 2 each instructed the broker to sell their respective shares. D. Qualys Reveals Its Q1 2015 Financial Results 26. On May 4, 2015, after the U.S. markets had closed, Qualys publicly announced its Q1 2015 financial results.  The company revealed that it had missed the low end of its previously-announced Q1 2015 revenue guidance range by $100,000.  At the same time, the company announced that it was revising its full-year 2015 revenue guidance downward, from $167.3 million - $169.3 million to $165 million - $166.5 million.  Qualys also disclosed that the growth rate for its largest business segment had declined.  That same day, after the earnings announcement, Deeba sent a text message to Brother 2, stating, ﬁWe announced the bad news today.ﬂ  The following day, Qualys™s stock price dropped 25%. 27. By selling their stock on April 8, Brother 1 and Brother 2 avoided losses of $456,636 and $124,534, respectively, totaling $581,170 in losses avoided.

Paragraphs 1 through 27 are hereby re-alleged and are incorporated herein by reference. 29. Deeba knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he had a duty to Qualys and its shareholders not to share material nonpublic information about the company with any people who would trade on that information. 30. Deeba knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the information he shared with his brothers about Qualys™s Q1 2015 sales was material and nonpublic. 31. Deeba, in breach of the duty he owed to Qualys and its shareholders, tipped material, nonpublic information concerning Qualys™s Q1 2015 sales to Brother 1 and Brother 2.  Deeba knew that Brother 1 and Brother 2 would sell Qualys stock on the basis of this information. 32. Deeba benefitted from the tip because the two persons he tipped were close relatives who traded on the tip. 33. Defendant Deeba, with scienter, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities as set forth above, directly or indirectly: a. employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud; b. made untrue statements of material facts and omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and c. engaged in acts, practices, and courses of business which operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon other persons, including purchasers and sellers of securities;  by the use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and of the mails, and the facilities of a national securities exchange. 34. By reason of the foregoing, Defendant Deeba violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.

43,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,   v.  KIMBERLY PINE KITTS,    Defendant.    Civil Action No. _________________    JURY TRIAL DEMANDED    COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint against defendant Kimberly Pine Kitts (ﬁKittsﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ), alleges as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. From April 2004 through November 2017, the Defendant was employed as an investment adviser representative at a dually-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser firm (ﬁFirmﬂ).  Over the course of several years she engaged in various schemes to defraud her clients.  These schemes included: (1) forging withdrawal requests and misappropriating clients™ variable annuity funds; (2) forging wire and check requests and misappropriating clients™ brokerage account funds; and (3) misleading a client to withdraw funds from a retirement account and secretly directing those funds to the Defendant™s bank account.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 209(d), 209(e), and 214 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(d), 80b-9(e) and 80b-14] Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 1 of 8 2  and Sections 21(d)(3), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(3), 78u(e), and 78aa]. 3. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 214 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because a substantial portion of the conduct alleged in this complaint occurred within the District of Massachusetts.   4. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendant, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. DEFENDANT 5. Kitts, age 51, is a resident of Orleans, Massachusetts.  In April 2004 she was employed by the Firm as a registered representative and investment adviser representative in one of the Firm™s branch offices in Massachusetts doing business as (ﬁd/b/aﬂ) Marquis Consulting, LLC (ﬁMarquisﬂ), an entity she created and wholly controlled. 6. In addition to operating as a d/b/a, Marquis purportedly offered tax and business valuation services, and Kitts performed tax work for several of her advisory clients through Marquis.  Kitts represented that she was a Certified Public Accountant, and even told at least two of her advisory clients that she held a Ph.D. in economics, neither of which is true.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 7. Beginning in 2011, the Defendant engaged in at least three separate schemes to misappropriate the assets of her clients in order to pay her personal expenses.  She directed these client assets to two bank accounts for Marquis, although the majority of misappropriated funds Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 2 of 8 3  were placed in one account (the ﬁMarquis Accountﬂ).  In each instance, the Defendant exploited her fiduciary relationship with an advisory client, made intentional misstatements, and engaged in deceptive conduct in order to obscure her wrongdoing.    Misappropriation of Clients™ Variable Annuity Funds  8. Some of the Defendant™s advisory clients purchased and held a type of financial product known as a variable annuity.  A variable annuity is a contract between an investor and an insurance company, under which the insurance company agrees to make periodic payments to the investor, beginning either immediately or at some future date.  From July 2011 through June 2013, the Defendant made unauthorized withdrawals from the variable annuities of six of her advisory clients (collectively, ﬁthe Annuity Clientsﬂ).  The Defendant submitted withdrawal forms to two insurance companies on which she forged her clients™ signatures and directed the funds to two of her Marquis bank accounts for her personal use.  In total, the Defendant made 24 unauthorized withdrawals of client funds totaling $962,654.   Misappropriation of Clients™ Brokerage Account Funds 9. In June 2013, the Defendant began stealing money from three of her clients™ brokerage accounts.  Client A is in her early-50s and was a client of the Defendant for seven years.  Clients B and C are a retired couple who were clients of the Defendant for 12 years.  Clients B and C were also Annuity Clients from whom the Defendant had misappropriated $481,401.85 in variable annuity funds. 10. On June 24, 2013, the Defendant forged Client A™s signature on an Outgoing Federal Fund Wire Request to the Firm with instructions to wire $75,000 from Client A™s brokerage account to the Marquis Account ﬁfor further creditﬂ to Client A.  The Defendant did Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 3 of 8 4  not ﬁcreditﬂ or use these funds for the benefit of Client A, but instead used them for her own personal purposes.      11. In an apparent attempt to avoid questions about transferring Client A™s funds to a third-party account, i.e., the Marquis Account, the Defendant submitted fake documentation to the Firm showing that Client A was the owner of a New York-based company, Marquis, LLC.  In fact, Marquis, LLC was non-existent.  Client A never formed any such company nor had any knowledge of the Defendant™s representations to the Firm. 12. After the initial $75,000 transfer of Client A™s funds, the Defendant submitted several additional wire requests forged with Client A™s signature.  By November 2013, the Defendant established a standing authorization through additional forgeries of Client A™s signature to allow her to transfer money from Client A™s account to the Marquis Account without a written request.  The Defendant transferred a total of $355,636.87 from Client A™s brokerage account to her Marquis Account in 2013.  The steady conversion of funds occurred over the next four years in the following amounts: $763,000 in 2014; $357,250 in 2015; $530,000 in 2016; and $9,000 in 2017.  In total, from 2013 to 2017 the Defendant made 56 unauthorized withdrawals, misappropriating $2,014,887 from Client A™s brokerage account. 13. After Client A™s funds were nearly depleted from Client A™s brokerage account by early 2017, the Defendant returned to stealing funds from Clients B and C.  In May 2017, the Defendant forged a written request for a $125,000 check from Clients B and C™s brokerage account payable to Marquis LLC.  The Defendant deposited this check into her Marquis Account.  Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 4 of 8 5   Misleading her Client to Withdraw Money from her Retirement Account 14. In June 2017, the Defendant advised Client B that she should move $200,000 from her individual retirement account (ﬁIRAﬂ) to the managed cash account she shared with Client C to pay some taxes.  The Defendant tricked Client B into signing signature pages for IRA distributions, while concealing the directions for delivery of funds.  Unbeknownst to Clients B and C, the Defendant directed the $200,000 distribution to her Marquis Account.    The Defendant™s Cover-Up 15. In August 2017, Client A asked the Defendant for all of her account statements, not yet suspecting any wrongdoing.  When the Defendant failed to provide her statements, Client A™s lawyer contacted the Firm.  In response, the Firm initiated an investigation.  After seeing the large number of wire transfers from Client A™s brokerage account to the Marquis Account, the Firm asked the Defendant to provide the Marquis Account monthly statements.  To hide evidence of the unauthorized withdrawals from Client A™s brokerage account, the Defendant electronically altered the Marquis Account monthly statements to change the sources and amounts of the deposits into that account.   16. In addition, the Defendant told the Firm that Marquis, LLC was created by Client A and named after the Defendant™s company because of their close friendship.  In an attempt to bolster this falsehood, the Defendant created fake Schedule C tax forms for Marquis, LLC for 2014-2016 and emailed them to the Firm.   17. By early November 2017, the Firm concluded that the Defendant misappropriated funds from Client A™s account.  The Firm terminated the Defendant on November 15, 2017.    Tolling Agreement  18. Kitts entered a tolling agreement with the Commission for the period March 1, 2018 through December 1, 2018.  This agreement tolled the running of any limitations period or Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 5 of 8 6  any other time-related defenses to any claims alleged in the Complaint for a period of nine months.

In July 2016, Defendant Dr. Anup Madan (ﬁMadanﬂ) engaged in insider trading in the securities of Sequenom, Inc. (ﬁSequenomﬂ), a San Diego life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  Madan, a scientist at Laboratory Corporation of American Holding (ﬁLabCorpﬂ), misappropriated material nonpublic information from his employer relating to LabCorp™s bid to acquire Sequenom through a tender offer.  Madan knowingly used this material nonpublic information to place illegal trades in Sequenom stock before the public announcement of the acquisition.  2. On July 21, 2016, Madan learned about the potential LabCorp-Sequenom acquisition Case 2:18-cv-01121   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 1 of 7  COMPLAINT SEC V.

Madan, whose visit took place on July 23, 2016, knew that the visit to Sequenom, as well as the contemplated acquisition, was nonpublic, confidential information.   3. On July 25 and 26, 2016, the first trading days following his site visit to Sequenom,  Madan bought a total of 9,300 shares of Sequenom stock, which at the time of his purchase were trading between $0.84 and $0.88 per share.    4. On July 27, 2016, LabCorp and Sequenom issued a joint press release announcing the companies™ execution of merger agreement under which LabCorp would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sequnom in a cash tender offer of $2.40 per share, or $371 million.  That day, the price of Sequenom stock increased 176%.  After the announcement, Madan sold all of his Sequenom shares, reaping ill-gotten gains of $14,023.    5. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Madan violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78n(e)] and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.14e-3].

Dr. Anup Madan, age 52, is a resident of Bellevue, Washington, and is an employee of LabCorp™s Covance Genomics Laboratory.   RELEVANT ENTITIES  11. Sequenom, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Diego, California.  Sequenom is a life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  Sequenom was acquired in a 2016 tender offer by LabCorp, and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of LabCorp.  Sequenom™s common stock was formerly registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and was traded on the NASDAQ (ticker: SQNM).  12. Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina.  The common stock of LabCorp is registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: LH). FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 13. Sequenom is a life sciences company that provides molecular diagnostic testing services, with an emphasis on noninvasive prenatal testing.  On June 8, 2016, Sequenom™s board of directors instructed a large investment bank to contact LabCorp and a few other companies to assess their interest in acquiring Sequenom, which was subject to a large amount of outstanding debt.

Madan is a principal scientist and senior director in LabCorp™s Seattle, Washington Covance Genomics Laboratory, where he has worked since 2010.  On July 21, 2016, a Thursday, Madan responded to a LabCorp supervisor™s email to a small group of LabCorp employees requesting that someone visit Sequenom™s San Diego facilities to perform a confidential due diligence check.  The visit was to take place on a nonworking day Œ that Saturday, July 23 Œ so that Sequenom staff would not become aware of the evaluation due to the secretive nature of the pending acquisition.  15. On July 23, 2016, Madan visited Sequenom™s site.  He knew that his visit to Sequenom was confidential, and that it was related to a potential acquisition of Sequenom by his employer, LabCorp.  Having signed an insider trading policy as part of his employment, Madan knew that he had a duty to LabCorp not to engage in trading based upon confidential information that he acquired in the course of performing his job duties.  Nevertheless, on July 25 and 26, 2016, the first two trading days after his site visit, Madan purchased 9,300 shares of Sequenom stock, which at the time were trading between $0.84 to $0.88 per share.    16. On July 27, 2016, the companies announced that LabCorp, through its wholly owned subsidiary Savoy Acquisition Corp., would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sequenom in a cash tender offer for $2.40 per share, or $371 million including Sequenom™s net indebtedness.  After the announcement of the merger, Sequenom™s stock price increased 176% to $2.35 per share.  The total daily trading volume increased from 363,087 on the day before the announcement to 40,718,435 on the day of the announcement Œ an increase of 11,214.5% in one trading day.  17. Immediately following the announcement of the LabCorp-Sequenom merger on July 27, 2016, Madan sold all of his shares later that day for a realized profit of $14,023.

At the time of the relevant conduct described above, Madan acted with scienter.  Madan traded Sequenom stock on the basis of material nonpublic information that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, was material and nonpublic.    19.

Rather than investing the money, Kelly stole it and spent his victims™ money for things like Super Bowl tickets, luxury vacations and cash withdrawals.   4. Many of Kelly™s victims are elderly retirees, and his victims include widows, veterans and people with disabilities. 5. Kelly treats Lion™s Share as his personal piggy bank, and he has transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor money to bank accounts he controls to support his lifestyle.  He has also withdrawn large quantities of investor money in cash throughout the course of the scheme, and the disposition of those funds is unknown.     6. Emergency relief is critical in this case.  Kelly has continued to steal money from his victims even after having been interviewed by representatives of Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 2 of 21  -3-the SEC™s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations and then stole even more money after having received a subpoena from the SEC™s Division of Enforcement.   VIOLATIONS 7. The Defendants have engaged in acts or practices that violated, or aided and abetted violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1), 77q(a)(2), and 77q(a)(3)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and subsections (a), (b), and (c) of Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5 (a), (b), and (c)] and , Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) of 1940 [15 U.S.C. § 80b-6].  Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, defendants will continue to engage in acts and practices that violate and or aid and abet violations of these provisions. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v], Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)] and Sections 209(d) and 209(e) of Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 3 of 21  -4-the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(b) and (d)] to enjoin Defendants from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint, and transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object, for civil penalties and for other equitable relief.  9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa], and Section 214 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14(a)]. 10. Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails, and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 11. Venue is proper in this Court because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act occurred in the Northern District of Georgia and Defendants reside in this district.   THE DEFENDANTS 12. Sean Kelly (CRD#2294170), age 49, is a resident of Marietta, Georgia. He is a registered representative of Center Street Securities, Inc., a registered Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 4 of 21  -5-broker-dealer of securities.  He is the owner and principal of various entities that operate under the ﬁLion™s Shareﬂ umbrella.  Kelly has Series 6, 7, and 63 securities licenses.  Kelly held himself out to clients as both a broker-dealer and an investment adviser. 13. Lion™s Share Financial of East Cobb, Inc. (ﬁLS Financialﬂ) is a Georgia corporation that was established in 2007.  LS Financial has its principal place of business at 3535 Roswell Road, Suite 1, Marietta, Georgia 30062. Kelly is the CEO, CFO, registered agent and Secretary of LS Financial.  On information and belief, Kelly was at all times the sole owner and operator of LS Financial, and LS Financial is an alter ego of Kelly. 14. Lionsshare Tax Services, LLC (ﬁLS Taxﬂ) is a Georgia LLC formed in 2009 that was administratively dissolved in 2016.  Kelly used a bank account in the name of LS Tax in furtherance of his fraudulent scheme from at least January 2017 through the summer of 2018.  On information and belief, Kelly was at all times the sole owner and operator of LS Tax, and LS Tax is an alter ego of Kelly.  15. Lion™s Share & Associates, Inc. (ﬁLS Associatesﬂ) is held out to be an entity by Kelly, but its corporate status is unknown to the Commission.  Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 5 of 21  -6-Since at least summer 2018, Kelly used a bank account in the name of LS Associates in furtherance of his fraudulent scheme.  On information and belief, Kelly was at all times the sole owner and operator of LS Associates, and LS Associates is an alter ego of Kelly. THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME 16. Kelly operates using the ﬁLion™s Shareﬂ umbrella, primarily operating through LS Financial. 17. Kelly has been a stockbroker for at least 18 years. 18. He has also provided tax planning, insurance brokering and other financial services during that time. 19. Kelly solicits customers using a variety of techniques, including offering free tax preparation services for veterans and free retirement planning seminars in assisted living facilities. 20. Many of Kelly™s customers are elderly retirees. 21. Since at least 2014, Kelly has been stealing his customers™ investment funds. Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 6 of 21  -7-22. The mechanics of the scheme are fairly simple. When Kelly™s customers had funds that they desired to invest, he would sometimes have them make the check out to ﬁLion™s Share.ﬂ 23. He would then deposit the check into a bank account controlled by him. 24. Rather than investing the customer™s money, Kelly would spend it on things like mortgage payments, Superbowl tickets and luxury vacations.  He would also oftentimes withdraw large sums of cash from ATMs.    25. For example, Investors A and B are an elderly retired couple.   26. Investor A is a veteran, and he and his wife met Kelly after he advertised free tax preparation services for veterans.  Shortly thereafter, they began investing their retirement savings through Kelly. 27. Beginning in 2014, Investors A and B provided Kelly with checks made out to Lion™s Share worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for the purpose of being invested. 28. Kelly told Investors A and B that the money was invested in a variety of private placements, annuities, investment funds and real estate investment trusts. Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 7 of 21  -8-29. In fact, Kelly spent most of the money he received from Investors A and B for his own personal use. 30. Kelly provided Investors A and B with fabricated statements purporting to come from the companies in which Investors A and B believed they were investing. 31. Kelly also provided Investors A and B with fabricated portfolio summaries showing investment values and returns for investments that had not been made. 32. Kelly wrote checks to Investors A and B that he told them represented returns on investments they believed they owned. 33. Kelly later deposited checks directly into Investors A™s and B™s bank account that he also told them came from returns on investments they believed they owned.  34. In fact, the ﬁreturnsﬂ were paid from the proceeds of investment checks written by other victims of Kelly. 35. Kelly solicited and received a $20,000 check made out to Lion™s Share from Investors A and B in September 2018.  He told investors A and B that the money would be invested in a real estate investment fund.   Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 8 of 21  -9-36. By that time, Kelly was aware of the Commission™s investigation that led to the filing of this action.  Nevertheless, Kelly did not invest the $20,000 as he represented that he would. 37. The real estate investment trust with which the $20,000 should have been invested has no record of any investment by Investors A and B. 38. Several other companies in which Investors A and B believed they own investments have no record of their purported investments. 39. Investors C and D are a retired couple.  In the fall of 2017, at Kelly™s suggestion, they cashed in an annuity and provided two checks totaling $25,000 to Kelly.  The checks were made out to ﬁLion™s Share.ﬂ 40. Kelly told Investors C and D that he would invest the $25,000. 41. Kelly deposited the checks in a bank account in the name of LS Tax that he controlled. 42. He did not invest the money, but instead he spent it for his own purposes. 43. At a meeting in August 2018 with Investors C and D, Kelly provided them with a ﬁportfolio summaryﬂ showing their investments.  The portfolio Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 9 of 21  -10-summary did not reflect the $25,000 they had given to Kelly nearly a year earlier. 44. At that time, when questioned, Kelly handwrote ﬁ+25,000ﬂ on the bottom of their portfolio summary and claimed that he was holding the money until a suitable investment could be identified. 45. Investor E is the retired manager of an assisted living facility. 46. Investor E has limited retirement savings. 47. Investor E received a large settlement from a lawsuit alleging that she took a defective drug that caused her to suffer and undergo treatment for cancer.   48. In total, Investor E received close to $100,000 from the settlement. 49. In a series of checks made out to ﬁLion™s Share,ﬂ Investor E provided Kelly $98,000 to invest.   50. Kelly deposited Investor E™s checks into an account in the name of LS Tax that he controlled. 51. Kelly told Investor E that he would invest the money he received from Investor E. Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 10 of 21  -11-52. Investor E trusted Kelly to invest the money in whatever investments he believed were in her best interest. 53. Kelly spent Investor E™s money for his personal expenses rather than investing it. 54. Investor F has invested a large portion of his retirement savings with Kelly and Lion™s Share. 55. In August 2018, Investor F gave Kelly a check for $5,000 made out to ﬁLion™s Share.ﬂ  Kelly told Investor F that he would deposit the $5,000 into Investor F™s brokerage account for subsequent investing. 56. Kelly deposited the check into a bank account in the name of LS Associates that is controlled by him. 57. Kelly did not deposit the $5,000 into Investor F™s brokerage account. 58. On information and belief, Kelly spent Investor F™s $5,000 for his own purposes.  59. Although the full extent of Kelly™s fraudulent scheme is unknown to the SEC at this time, many other checks that appear to be from investors were deposited into the LS Tax account and LS Associates account and spent by Kelly.   Case 1:18-cv-04939-TCB   Document 1   Filed 10/25/18   Page 11 of 21  -12-60. Some of the checks from Kelly™s customers appear on their face to have been for the purpose of investing.  For example, Kelly deposited a check from a customer™s closed out 401(k) account into the LS Tax account.  He also deposited customer checks that had things such as ﬁfor CDﬂ and ﬁfor investﬂ written in the memo line into that account.    61. On information and belief, Kelly has misappropriated more than $1,000,000 from his customers over the past four years. 62. The Commission staff subpoenaed Kelly for testimony during the investigation that led to this action.  Kelly™s testimony was scheduled for October 24, 2018.   63. During a phone call with the Commission™s lead investigator two days before the scheduled testimony, Kelly affirmed that he intended to testify at the scheduled time and stated that he would ﬁcome clean.ﬂ  Kelly did not show up for his scheduled testimony.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78u-1].   2.

On information and belief, Defendant Rong Chen is an inhabitant, transacts business, and may be found in the Central District of California.  Relief Defendant Yuehong Wang is Chen™s wife and is an inhabitant of and may be found in the Central District of California.  Wang resides, and, on information and belief, Chen at least periodically resides, at their home in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.      5. Chen has directly or indirectly made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein. 6. Chen will, unless enjoined, continue to engage in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint, or in acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar purport and object. SUMMARY 7. Over a two year period, Defendant Rong Chen engaged in multiple acts of insider trading by making timely and highly profitable securities purchases based on material nonpublic information about the impending acquisitions of two China-based companies whose securities traded on exchanges in the United States.  Chen obtained this inside information in the course of his work advising the acquiring Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 2 of 14   Page ID #:2  COMPLAINT 3   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728companies on these transactions.  Attempting to conceal his insider trading, Chen placed his trades using the brokerage account of his wife, Yuehong Wang.  Chen™s insider trading generated more than $173,000 in illicit profits, the majority of which Chen transferred to his and Wang™s joint bank account.  Because Wang shared the benefits of Chen™s illegal conduct, she is named as a Relief Defendant in this action.  8. Chen™s first set of insider trades occurred while he was the Vice President of Investments for the Chinese company Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (ﬁTsinghuaﬂ).  On November 11, 2013, Tsinghua publicly announced that it would acquire another Chinese company, RDA Microelectronics, Inc. (ﬁRDAﬂ).  Prior to that announcement, Chen used his wife™s U.S. brokerage account to make a series of well-timed purchases of RDA securities, generating profits of more than $79,500 following the acquisition announcement.  Chen personally worked on the RDA acquisition, and made those trades based on material, nonpublic information not available to the investing public.   9. In early 2015, Chen again engaged in insider trading, this time purchasing securities of the Chinese company 58.com Inc. (ﬁ58.comﬂ).  By January 2015, Chen was working as an investment consultant to 58.com on the acquisition of a large stake in a rival company.  Shortly before the acquisition was announced to the public, Chen used his wife™s brokerage account to buy ﬁout of the moneyﬂ 58.com call options on a U.S. exchange.  When news of the acquisition became public, 58.com™s stock price skyrocketed, and Chen sold his options, earning profits of more than $94,400.  Again, by virtue of his work on the deal, when he purchased the 58.com options Chen had knowledge of material, nonpublic information that was not available to other investors.   10. Chen™s insider trading violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5).  The Commission brings this action to hold Chen accountable for his illegal conduct, permanently enjoin Chen from further insider trading, and impose civil penalties.  Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 3 of 14   Page ID #:3  COMPLAINT 4   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728The Commission also seeks an order requiring Chen and Wang to, jointly and severally, pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest on all ill-gotten gains they received by virtue of Chen™s insider trading.   COMMONLY-USED TRADING TERMS 11. A stock option, commonly referred to as an ﬁoption,ﬂ gives its purchaser-holder the option to buy or sell shares of an underlying stock at a specified price (the ﬁstrike priceﬂ) before a specified time (the ﬁexpirationﬂ).  Options are generally sold in ﬁcontracts,ﬂ which give the option holder the opportunity to buy or sell 100 shares of an underlying stock.  If the holder does not exercise the option prior to the expiration date, the option expires as worthless. 12. A ﬁcallﬂ option, such as those purchased by Chen, gives the purchaser-holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security at a specified strike price prior to expiration.  For example, one ﬁDecember 2013 $15ﬂ call on ABC Co.™s shares would give the purchaser the right to buy 100 ABC shares for $15 per share before the call expired on a specified date in December 2013.  Generally, the buyer of a call option anticipates that the price of the underlying security will increase prior to expiration.  If the call option™s strike price is above the price at which the underlying stock is trading, the call option is considered to be ﬁout of the money,ﬂ because it would be unprofitable to exercise the call and pay more for the stock than the price for which it could be obtained in the market.  Conversely, if the strike price is below the then-current market price, the call is considered to be ﬁin the money,ﬂ because one could exercise the option, obtain the stock at the strike price, and then sell it at the higher market price for a profit.  For a given expiration month, out of the money options are typically cheaper to buy than those that are in the money. // // // Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 4 of 14   Page ID #:4  COMPLAINT 5   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728FACTS The Defendant and Relief Defendant 13.

Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 5 of 14   Page ID #:5  COMPLAINT 6   1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272820. On September 27, 2013, RDA publicly announced that it had received a non-binding acquisition proposal from a potential buyer at $15.50 per ADS.   21. By October 2013, Chen was employed by Tsinghua as its Vice President for Investments.  In that position, Chen had access to and possessed material, nonpublic information about Tsinghua™s acquisition of RDA described herein.  Chen also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he was required to keep information about the acquisition confidential.   22. On October 21, 2013, personnel from RDA and Tsinghua met to discuss a potential acquisition and, three days later, the companies executed a non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.   23. On October 24, 2013, the potential buyer that submitted the acquisition proposal previously announced on September 27 informed RDA that it would not consider increasing its acquisition offer.   24. The next day, October 25, Tsinghua made an acquisition proposal to RDA for $18.00 per ADS Œ a $2.50 per ADS increase over the proposal announced on September 27.  Tsinghua™s offer included a confidentiality requirement that precluded RDA from immediately disclosing it.  25. On October 28, 2013, RDA sent a draft merger agreement to Tsinghua.   26. That same day, Chen opened, in Wang™s name, a brokerage account at a United States brokerage firm (the ﬁWang accountﬂ).  Chen left blank the portion of the online account application that requested information about Wang™s marital status, and he listed Wang as the only person with trading authority over the account.  When he opened the Wang account, Chen requested the ability to place trades in the account on margin. 27. Despite listing Wang as the sole person with trading authority over the Wang account, Chen had access to and directed all of the trading in that account.  28. Upon opening the Wang account, Chen funded the account with an initial deposit of $17,000.

On October 30, 2013, Tsinghua and RDA personnel met to discuss the potential acquisition. 30. The following day, October 31, Chen sold all of the holdings in a joint brokerage account that he and Wang had opened in 2008 (the ﬁjoint brokerage accountﬂ).  Chen had no prior history trading RDA securities in this account.  Chen sold those holdings for more than $19,000, and transferred the account balance to his and Wang™s joint bank account (the ﬁjoint bank accountﬂ). 31. On November 1, 2013, Chen purchased 270 RDA December 2013 $15 call options in the Wang account for $16,409.  That same day, Chen deposited an additional $18,000 into the Wang account from their joint bank account.   32. On November 6, 2013, Chen purchased, on margin, eight RDA December 2013 $15 call options and 2,300 RDA ADSs at $15.59 per share, for a total of $36,512.   33. Later that day, after the close of trading, RDA publicly announced its receipt of Tsinghua™s previously undisclosed October 25, 2013 offer to acquire RDA for $18 per ADS.  34. The market reacted favorably to the announcement.  The next day, November 7, 2013, the price of RDA ADSs climbed and closed at $17.24, up from RDA™s pre-announcement close of $15.55, a 10.9% increase. 35. That same day, Chen sold all 2,300 of the RDA ADSs he had recently purchased in the Wang account for approximately $39,700, realizing one day profits of $3,852.  Later that day, Chen purchased an additional 86 RDA December 2013 $15 call options for $19,832. 36. On November 11, 2013 at 3:33 a.m. ET, RDA and Tsinghua issued a joint press release announcing the companies™ entry into a definitive merger agreement under which Tsinghua would acquire RDA at a price of $18.50 per ADS Œ an increase of $.50 per ADS over Tsinghua™s previously disclosed offer.  The press release identified Chen as Tsinghua™s ﬁVice President Œ Investmentsﬂ and its contact Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 7 of 14   Page ID #:7  COMPLAINT 8   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728person for questions about the RDA acquisition.   37. RDA and Tsinghua later disclosed in a Commission filing that Chen was a director of a special purpose entity that was created to effectuate the merger and signed the amended merger agreement on behalf of that entity.  Other Commission filings also disclosed that Chen was an official designated by the parties to receive notices regarding the merger agreement. 38. On November 11, 2013, following the press release, Chen sold all 364 RDA December 2013 call options that he had purchased in November 2013, for more than $112,500, realizing a profit of roughly $75,670 on his RDA options trades.

Chen™s 58.com Insider Trading 40. By January 2015, 58.com was considering acquiring a large stake in a privately-held rival company, ganji.com (ﬁganjiﬂ), and had retained Chen to assist with the potential acquisition. 41. On January 23, 2015, 58.com and Chen entered into a ﬁfinder™sﬂ agreement regarding the potential ganji acquisition.  In the agreement, 58.com acknowledged that Chen originated and introduced the potential ganji acquisition to 58.com. 42. The finder™s agreement provided that 58.com would pay Chen $5 million in the event 58.com or its affiliates obtained a majority equity interest in ganji.  Should 58.com obtain less than a majority stake in ganji, the agreement provided that Chen would receive a payment from 58.com in an amount to be mutually determined by 58.com and Chen. 43. The finder™s agreement additionally contained a confidentiality clause that committed Chen to maintaining ﬁfull confidentialityﬂ of all information regarding the agreement and the contemplated ganji acquisition. Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 8 of 14   Page ID #:8  COMPLAINT 9   1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272844. In early 2015, Chen became a Managing Director at a Hong Kong-based investment banking firm. 45. On March 11, 2015, 58.com engaged Chen™s investment banking firm to advise on its potential acquisition of ganji.  Chen worked on, and was privy to material nonpublic information about, the proposed ganji acquisition.  Chen also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he was required to keep information about the acquisition confidential.   46. As consultants to 58.com, Chen and his investment banking firm were subject to 58.com™s insider trading policies, which expressly prohibited trading based on material nonpublic information related to 58.com. 47. Between March 12 and April 12, 2015, 58.com and the investment banking firm where Chen worked exchanged term sheets with various ganji stakeholders and executives and the parties convened several conference calls and meetings in Beijing to discuss a potential acquisition of ganji.  In a series of meetings that took place from late in the day of April 13, 2015 to the morning of April 14, 2015 (Beijing time), management from 58.com and ganji agreed to a framework for the transaction and to a memorandum of understanding (ﬁMOUﬂ) regarding the acquisition, which was executed on April 14, 2015.   48. The same day 58.com entered the MOU, April 14, 2015, starting at 9:59 a.m. ET (9:59 p.m. Beijing time) through 10:06 a.m. ET (10:06 p.m. Beijing time), Chen used the Wang account to purchase, at a cost of $5,507.68, 100 58.com call options with a strike price of $55 and an expiration date only three days away.  These call options were significantly out of the money.  The day before Chen™s option purchases, 58.com™s shares had closed at $50.83.   49. Chen made these options purchases using nearly the entire cash balance in the Wang account.  Chen had no prior history trading 58.com securities in the joint brokerage account or the Wang account. 50. Less than 30 minutes after Chen made the 58.com options purchases, Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 9 of 14   Page ID #:9  COMPLAINT 10   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Bloomberg News reported that 58.com and ganji had agreed to merge and were expected to announce the deal as early as the following day. 51. Following the reporting on the merger, 58.com™s share price jumped sharply and closed at $67.87 on April 14, 2015, a 33.52% increase over the prior day™s close. 52. Two days later, on April 16, 2015, Chen sold all 100 of his 58.com call options for $99,910.47, realizing insider trading profits of more than $94,400.   53. Chen made no additional trades in the Wang account, but later transferred $100,000 from the Wang account to their joint bank account. 54. Following the announcement of the merger, Chen received a cash payment from 58.com pursuant to the finder™s agreement.  On July 9, 2015, Chen emailed a bank employee in Hong Kong who had inquired about the payment from 58.com.  In the email, Chen wrote that ﬁthe payment is related to a M&A transaction I participated in as the advisor of the acquirer.ﬂ  COUNT I Chen™s RDA Securities Trading in Violation of Exchange Act  Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] 55.

Miller   Douglas M. Miller  Attorney for Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission    Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 14 of 14   Page ID #:14","The SEC filed insider trading charges on September 10, 2018 against a corporate deal advisor for trading in securities of two China-based companies based on confidential information about their impending acquisitions. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Rong Chen obtained this inside information in the course of his work advising the acquiring companies on these transactions and used an account bearing his wife's name in order to conceal the illicit trades. The SEC also charged Chen's wife, Yuehong Wang, as a relief defendant.According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Chen was Vice President of Investments for Tsinghua Unigroup Limited during its 2014 acquisition of RDA Microelectronics Inc. and learned of the deal before it was announced. The SEC's complaint alleges that shortly before the November 11, 2013 announcement, Chen opened a brokerage account in his wife's name and used that account to make a series of well-timed purchases of RDA securities ahead of the announcement to generate more than $79,500 in trading profits. The SEC further alleges that when Chen later became Managing Director at a Hong Kong-based investment banking firm advising 58.com Inc. on its April 2015 acquisition of rival ganji.com, he again used his wife's brokerage account to commit insider trading, buying high risk 58.com call options, which he sold after news of the acquisition for profits of more than $94,400.The SEC's complaint charges Chen with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, jointly and severally from Chen and Wang plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty from Chen.The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Marcus Fruchter and Amy Flaherty Hartman of the SEC's Cyber Unit in the Chicago Regional Office and David Makol and John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The case has been supervised by Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Kathryn Pyszka, an Associate Regional Director in the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Benjamin Hanauer and Marcus Fruchter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Association."
