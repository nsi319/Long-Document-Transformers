Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Connecticut resident David S. Haddad and two companies he operates in connection with a fraudulent scheme to raise funds from retail investors. Haddad and the two companies have offered to settle the case by, among other things, agreeing to pay a total of over $1 million, which includes disgorgement of money Haddad took in from investors and used for his own personal purposes.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Haddad operated two companies in the re-insurance industry, Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, LLC. Haddad allegedly began raising money from investors through the offer and sale of unregistered securities in Trafalgar in or before 2012. He began offering unregistered New England RE securities to investors in late 2014 and, through the Trafalgar and New England RE offerings, raised at least $2.5 million from at least 29 separate investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that, while making these offers and sales, Haddad, individually and on behalf of Trafalgar and New England RE, made various misleading claims to investors about the use of their funds. According to the SEC's complaint, Haddad led investors to believe that their funds would be used to build and grow Trafalgar and New England RE when, in fact, Haddad diverted a significant portion of the investors' money for his own purposes, including the purchase of multiple homes, art and antiques, entertainment, and expenses of a dog rescue charity founded by Haddad. Haddad also used some investors' money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors. The complaint alleges that the money Haddad used to support his lifestyle far exceeded Trafalgar's revenues.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, charges Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Haddad, Trafalgar, and New England RE have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of these laws. Haddad and Trafalgar also have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $619,382.43 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $25,131.83. Haddad and New England Re have agreed to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $269,080 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest $2,592.66. In addition, Haddad has agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $181,071 and has consented to the imposition of a permanent bar prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly-traded company. Haddad further has consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from providing information to, soliciting, or accepting investments or funds from any investor or potential investors regarding the offer or sale of any securities issued by any entity that he directly or indirectly owns, controls, consults for, or is employed by, unless he first provides such person with a written disclosure regarding his prior regulatory history and maintains written records of such disclosures.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ellen B. Moynihan, Deena R. Bernstein, Sofia T. Hussain, and Kevin B. Currid of the Boston Regional Office.
Generated Summary:
On January 11, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged David S. Haddad of Trafalgar Square Risk Management, LLC and New England RE, a Connecticut-based reinsurance company, with violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, from April 2012 until August 2016, HADDAD and his related companies raised more than $1 million from at least 29 investors by offering and selling non-existent stop-loss insurance products to self-insured companies. The SEC alleges that, in addition to misstatements and omissions in the prospectus and in other documents provided to investors in connection with the scheme, they also misrepresented that their funds would be used to build and grow the company. In fact, many of the investors raised money through the offer and sale of securities, including Trafalgar, which used the funds to make payments to other investors, and to support a dog rescue charity. Additionally, some investors received payments for their own personal expenses, such as vacations, art and antiques, entertainment, rent-to-own arrangements, purchases of multiple homes, artwork, dining out at various restaurants, entertaining at his properties, buying dog toys and making Ponzi-like payments in return for the money they raised. Without admitting or denying the allegations in court documents obtained by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Connecticut and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Connecticut Division of Criminal Investigation, there have been no criminal charges filed against the defendants. These charges are subject to court approval and a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and Section 10(b)(5 thereunder), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2.5 million, as well as civil penalties of up to $250,000, against each of them.

Actual Summary:
On March 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced securities fraud charges against a U.K.-based broker-dealer and its investment manager in connection with manipulative trading in the securities of HD View 360 Inc., a U.S.-based microcap issuer.  The SEC also announced charges against HD View's CEO, another individual, and three entities they control for manipulating HD View's securities as well as the securities of another microcap issuer, West Coast Ventures Group Corp.  The SEC further announced the institution of an order suspending trading in the securities of HD View.  These charges arise in part from an undercover operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which also resulted in related criminal prosecutions against these defendants by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.  In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Beaufort Securities Ltd. and Peter Kyriacou, an investment manager at Beaufort, manipulated the market for HD View's common stock.  The scheme involved an undercover FBI agent who described his business as manipulating U.S. stocks through pump-and-dump schemes.  Kyriacou and the agent discussed depositing large blocks of microcap stock in Beaufort accounts, driving up the price of the stock through promotions, manipulating the stock's price and volume through matched trades, and then selling the shares for a large profit.  The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou alleges that they:  opened brokerage accounts for the undercover agent in the names of nominees in order to conceal his identity and his connection to the anticipated trading activity in the accounts suggested that the undercover agent could create the false appearance that HD View's stock was liquid in advance of a pump-and-dump by "gam[ing] the market" through matched trades executed multiple purchase orders of HD View shares with the understanding that Beaufort's client had arranged for an associate to simultaneously offer an equivalent number of shares at the same price A second complaint filed by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleges that in a series of recorded telephone conversations with the undercover agent, HD View CEO Dennis Mancino and William T. Hirschy agreed to manipulate HD View's common stock by using the agent's network of brokers to generate fraudulent retail demand for the stock in exchange for a kickback from the trading proceeds.  According to the complaint, the three men agreed that Mancino and Hirschy would manipulate HD View stock to a higher price before using the agent's brokers to liquidate their positions at an artificially inflated price.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Mancino and Hirschy executed a "test trade" on Jan. 31, 2018, coordinated by the agent, consisting of a sell order placed by the defendants filled by an opposing purchase order placed by a broker into an account at Beaufort.  Unbeknownst to Mancino and Hirschy, the Beaufort account used for this trade was a nominal account that was opened and funded by the agent.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that, prior to their contact with the undercover agent, Mancino and Hirschy manipulated the market for HD View and for West Coast by using brokerage accounts that they owned, controlled, or were associated with –including TJM Investments Inc., DJK Investments 10 Inc., WT Consulting Group LLC – to effect manipulative "matched trades."  The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also charged Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, and penny stock bars from Beaufort and Kyriacou.  With respect to Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities, the SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, penny stock bars, and an officer-and-director bar against Mancino.  The investigation was conducted in the SEC's New York Regional Office by Tejal Shah and Joseph Darragh, Lorraine Collazo, and Michael D. Paley of the Microcap Fraud Task Force and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban, and in Washington, D.C. by Patrick L. Feeney, Robert Nesbitt, and Kevin Guerrero, and supervised by Antonia Chion.  Preethi Krishnamurthy and Ms. Shah will lead the SEC's litigation against Beaufort and Kyriacou.  Ann H. Petalas and Mr. Feeney, under the supervision of Cheryl Crumpton, will handle the SEC's litigation against Mancino, Hirschy, and their entities.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Alberta Securities Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The Commission's investigation in this matter is continuing.
Generated Summary:
On February 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a U.K.-based brokerage firm and its former business associate with manipulating the market of microcap securities in the United States.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Beaufort Securities Limited and Panayiotis Kyriacou with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, penalties and injunctive relief against the defendants. The complaint also charges the Undercover with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and aiding and abetting a scheme to manipulate the stock of HD View 360 Inc. (HD View).  According to the SEC, in an effort to create a false impression that the company was actively trading, a former employee at the firm told the undercover agent that he was working on a deal involving a $1,000 stock offering and that his client had arranged for the brokerage firms to simultaneously offer to sell an equivalent number of shares from other accounts. Without admitting or denying the allegations, however, both defendants agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a temporary restraining order permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 17(a)(1)(A) and (2)(B)(3) in connection with the above-mentioned violations. In addition, they will be ordered to pay civil penalties of up to $250,250.00 each, plus interest and penalties totaling $2,078.20. Following the settlement, each of them agreed not to participate in any offering of a penny stock that is subject to approval by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other federal agency. All of these settlement provisions apply to all of those entities.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") filed an enforcement action on January 31, 2018, in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, charging two Boston-area investment advisers with defrauding multiple clients by stealing nearly half a million dollars of client assets, along with other breaches of their fiduciary duty. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced criminal charges against Polese and Peterson.  According to the Commission's complaint, beginning in 2014, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson, while employed as investment advisers at a large financial institution, engaged in various schemes to defraud their clients, including stealing nearly $450,000 from one elderly client. In March 2016, Polese and Peterson fraudulently misappropriated $350,000 of their client's money, using $100,000 of those funds to make investments in their own names, and directing the remaining $250,000 to Polese's personal bank account. Then, from March through May of 2017, Polese made numerous unauthorized withdrawals from the same client's account totaling approximately $93,000 to pay Polese's credit card and college tuition expenses for Polese's children.  In addition to stealing client funds, the complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson breached their fiduciary duty to their clients when they (1) secretly put client funds at risk by using a client's assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a private entity in which Polese and Peterson were investors, and (2) invested client funds into an investment in which defendants held a financial interest, without informing the client or disclosing their conflict of interest. Additionally, Polese defrauded two clients through violations of his fiduciary duties to those clients including (1) obtaining a loan from a client on unfavorable terms to the client; and (2) charging a client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate he repeatedly promised to charge her.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Polese and Peterson violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and that they aided and abetted violations of Section 204 of the Advisers Act and Rule 204-2 thereunder. The Commission's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Polese and Peterson.  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Andrew H. Feller, Eric M. Brooks, and Kevin B. Currid of the Boston Regional Office. The Commission's litigation will be led by Martin F. Healey. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the FBI.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two investment advisers with defrauding their clients.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from August 2014 through May 2017, James S. Polese and Cornelius Peterson defrauded two clients through fraudulently using client funds to secure loans from a client without disclosing their conflict of interest. According to the complaint, in early May 2016, the two men allegedly stole approximately $93,000 from one of the clients, a retired paralegal, by falsely representing that the loan payment was intended to cover both of their personal expenses. In reality, it was a loan that was not authorized by the Financial Institution and was used to pay for their children's college tuition. As alleged in the SEC complaint in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 31, 2018, Peterson, who was also employed as an investment adviser representative, engaged in various schemes to defray his client's expenses, including: (1) investing client money into a private investment in which defendants held a financial interest; (2) secretly using clients' accounts and bank routing numbers on the pa yment pages of payees' websites; and (3) charging the client advisory fees 50% higher than the rate quoted by a broker. The complaint further alleged that Peterson violated his fiduciary duty to his clients by making false statements to clients about the amount of money he received from clients in return for his advice, without admitting or denying the allegations in his complaint. Additionally, he allegedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibits the commission from charging clients with securities fraud, and Section 206(2), which bars the Commission from investigating the financial institution's violations of its policies or controls relating to such loans. To settle the civil charges, both defendants have agreed to be permanently enjoined from the securities laws, as well as to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties and injunctive relief.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former registered representative with defrauding his brokerage customers out of nearly $4 million in a long-running investment scam.  According to the SEC's complaint, John C. Maccoll, who was affiliated with the Birmingham, Michigan branch of a nationwide registered broker dealer and investment adviser, used high pressure sales tactics to solicit at least 15 of his retail brokerage customers to invest in what he described as a highly-sought-after private fund investment. Most of the injured customers were elderly and retired and invested through their retirement accounts. Maccoll told his customers that the purported fund investment would allow them to diversify their portfolios, receive annual investment returns as high as 20%, and give them investment growth potential that was better than the growth they received in their brokerage accounts. As alleged in the complaint, Maccoll's statements to his customers were false - he did not invest the customers' money but stole it for his own personal use. In total, the customers invested nearly $4 million in the fraudulent scheme. To conceal the scheme, Maccoll allegedly instructed his customers not to tell others about the purported fund investment, provided some of his customers with fake account statements reflecting fictitious returns, and paid over $400,000 in Ponzi-like payments to certain of the customers to keep the scheme alive.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today filed criminal charges against Maccoll.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Michigan, charges Maccoll with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy "Lee" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. According to the SEC's complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings. In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments.  Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450.

The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan. According to the SEC's orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young's investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young's antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a default judgment as to liability has been entered against DaRayl D. Davis, a self-styled "Financial Coach" charged in December 2017 with operating an offering and investment advisory fraud.  On December 22, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Davis raised more than $5 million from approximately 30 investors by selling them fictitious financial products described as "corporate bond notes" and "guarantee bonds." Davis hosted seminars marketed as the "Smart Money Academy" and "The Smart Money Millionaire Experience," and used his religious affiliation to gain investors' trust. Investors believed the financial products sold by Davis were legitimate and would preserve and grow their investments. The complaint alleges that the investments were not legitimate and that Davis fabricated documents and made false statements concerning the fictitious financial products. Davis did not invest the money he raised from his clients, but instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, repay prior investors, and further his fraudulent scheme.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Davis violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from Davis, as well as disgorgement from relief defendant Affluent Advisory Group, LLC, against which default judgment as to liability also was entered.  At the time it filed its complaint, the SEC requested a temporary restraining order and an order temporarily freezing Davis's assets, both of which were granted the same day. On January 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy J. St. Eve granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, extended the asset freeze pending final judgment in the case, and entered default against Davis. At a hearing on March 26, 2018, Judge St. Eve entered default judgment against Davis as to liability, as well as against relief defendant AAG. Judge St. Eve also held Davis in contempt for violating the asset freeze and scheduled a hearing for May 10, 2018 to determine how to proceed with the remedies phase of the case.

Mascarenhas granted Davis' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $5 million plus prejudgment interest, plus interest and penalties, to be determined by the court upon completion of a two-year, $20,000-plus trial in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and a final judgment that permanently enjoins Davis from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b)(5)(A)(1)(B)(3)(C), and orders him held to account for future violations of those provisions. He is also barred from serving as a director or officer or director of an investment advisory firm.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a corporation and its principals with conducting a multi-million dollar offering fraud.  The SEC alleges that Nevada-based microcap issuer Intertech Solutions, Inc., which purports to be a project finance and management company for mining operations, William Scott Marshall, and David Naylor raised over $7 million from hundreds of investors throughout the United States and Canada. According to the SEC, Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor misled investors about the value of Intertech’s gold mine interest, Intertech’s timeframe for generating revenue, and commission payments Intertech made to securities solicitors. The complaint also alleges that, at Marshall’s direction, Intertech hired numerous individuals to engage in cold-call solicitations of investors. Finally, Marshall and Naylor allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds, which they used to pay for personal expenses such as such as gym memberships, resort stays, personal medical expenses, and a car Marshall exclusively used.  The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Nevada, charges Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor with violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint also charges Intertech and Marshall with aiding and abetting violations of the broker registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, Intertech, Marshall, Naylor, and relief defendant West Port Energy LLC, a company formed by Marshall and which allegedly received proceeds of the fraud, have agreed to disgorge nearly $7.4 million in proceeds from the alleged fraud, and Marshall and Naylor have agreed to pay civil penalties of $184,767 and $92,383, respectively. Intertech, Marshall, and Naylor have also agreed to permanent injunctions, and Marshall and Naylor have agreed to conduct-based injunctions and permanent officer-and-director and penny-stock bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC wishes to thank FINRA and the various state, federal, and foreign authorities that provided valuable assistance in this matter, including the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.  The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Laurie Abbott, James Thibodeau, and Kenji Kawa, was assisted by Trial Counsel Amy Oliver, and was supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley of the Salt Lake Regional Office.  The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
Generated Summary:
On August 20, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Nevada-based company, Intertech Solutions, Inc. and its co-defendant, William Scott Marshall, with defrauding investors through unregistered offerings of common stock and investment contracts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, alleges that Marshall and Naylor aided and abetted the making of false and misleading statements to investors regarding the value of the West Port Claims gold mine assets and the timeframe for revenue generation. The complaint also alleges Marshall assisted and aided the payment of commissions to certain investor solicitors, and Marshall defrauded hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds by making false statements about the amount of gold the company would receive from mining operations. In addition, Marshall allegedly assisted in facilitating the payments of over $7 million of investor money to various individuals and entities controlled by Marshall. Marshall also allegedly provided substantial assistance to a number of investors, including those who were neither registered with the SEC as broker or dealer, nor were they associated with a broker-dealer registered to analyze the gold mining claims. Additionally, he allegedly aided, abetting, or aiding the purchase and sale of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and (c), and Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other court proceeding, defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil money penalties and other relief, as well as a penalty of $1,000, which will be determined by the court upon request of each of these defendants.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged four individuals for their roles in a scheme to profit from the manipulation and illegal sale of stock of two publicly traded companies, Environmental Packaging Technologies Holdings, Inc. and CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp.  According to the SEC's complaint, Morrie Tobin, a California resident, worked with co-defendants Milan Patel, Matthew Ledvina, and Daniel Lacher to facilitate Tobin's scheme. Patel and Ledvina, attorneys at an international tax law firm, and Lacher, a resident of Switzerland, allegedly hid Tobin's ownership and control over the companies by using offshore entitites to hold his stock and by establishing accounts to sell that stock at Wintercap SA, a Swiss-based company run by U.K. citizen Roger Knox. On October 2, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an asset freeze against Knox and Wintercap, charging them with a scheme that generated more than $165 million of illegal sales of stock in at least 50 microcap companies.  The SEC's complaint charges that to maximize profits from the alleged scheme, the defendants arranged to pay a stock promoter to tout the stock of Environmental Packaging while creating the impression that the recommendation came from a neutral third party. Environmental Packaging shares more than doubled, from approximately $1.05 per share to $2.21 per share, during the promotional campaign. Patel, Ledvina, and Lacher allegedly planned to collect a percentage of the proceeds from the unlawful sales.  According to the complaint, after the SEC halted trading in the securities of Environmental Packaging on June 27, 2017, the defendants took steps to obstruct the SEC's investigation - and conceal their own involvement in the matter - by arranging to change the names listed on Wintercap account records.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in the District of Massachusetts, charges Tobin, Patel, Ledvina, and Lacher with violating various federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penny stock bars, and monetary penalties.  The SEC's case is being handled by J. Lauchlan Wash, Trevor Donelan, Eric Forni, David Scheffler, Rebecca Israel, Jonathan Allen, Kathleen Shields, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, in coordination with the Enforcement Division's Microcap Fraud Task Force. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission, and the Malta Financial Services Authority.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a Newport Beach, California resident and his company, Environmental Packaging Technologies Holdings, Inc., a Swiss company run by Roger Knox.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Morrie Tobin, Patel, Ledvina, and Daniel Lacher engaged in a deceptive scheme to sell publicly traded stock to investors. According to the complaint, from approximately June 2013 to approximately July 2017, Tobinn and the company's board of directors secretly controlled two public companies. In reality, these companies were controlled by a third party, not by the public company itself. As alleged in the SEC’s complaint in federal court in Boston, the defendants used a network of nominee entities and individuals to secretly hold Tobins' shares, arranging for offshore asset managers to deposit those shares with brokers in blocks constituting less than 5% of CURE's outstanding shares. Without disclosing accurate information about the ownership and control of the companies, they sold their shares without registering the offers or sales of stock with the Commission. The defendants also used shell companies to conceal their control over the two companies and to obstruct the investigation of possible violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 10(b)(1), (2), and 9(c)(3)(A), which prohibit the trading of shares by individuals or entities other than the listed company. Finally, in an effort to avoid detection of potential securities fraud, defendants agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, penalties and injunctive relief from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and other federal agencies, as well as to a temporary restraining order halting the sale of securities to individuals and entities that were not directly involved in this scheme.

Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a Florida-based CPA, a former broker, and his spouse, for their roles in a fraudulent scheme involving the creation and sale of a public shell company and false regulatory filings to facilitate the sale.  According to the SEC, David Dreslin and Michael Toups created a shell company, Anglesea Enterprises, Inc., by filing false and misleading registration statements and periodic reports with the SEC, creating a phony business plan, and appointing nominal officers and directors to conceal their control over the company. The goal of the alleged scheme was to sell Anglesea in a reverse merger for profit. The SEC also alleges that Leslie Toups served as Anglesea's majority shareholder and director and signed filings and other documents that contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions over a multiyear period.  The SEC's complaint, filed in Tampa, Florida, charges:  Dreslin, Michael Toups, and Leslie Toups with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Anglesea’s filing of false SEC reports, in violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 In the alternative, that Dreslin and Michael Toups violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 through or by means of others, in violation of Section 20(b) of the Exchange Act Dreslin with aiding and abetting false statements to Anglesea’s auditor in violation of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2, and aiding and abetting Anglesea’s violation of Rule 13a-13 under the Exchange Act Leslie Toups with failing to file required reports in violation of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock and officer-and-director bars from Dreslin, Michael Toups, and Leslie Toups, and disgorgement plus interest from Dreslin.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Leslie Toups agreed to settle the SEC's charges against her by agreeing to be barred, for five years, from serving as an officer or director of a public company or participating in a penny stock offering, to pay a $25,000 penalty, and to permanent injunctions against violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Michael Toups, the CFO of a China-based Chinese fuel storage company, was previously charged by the SEC with fraud in 2016 for issuing periodic filings and press releases that substantially overstated the company's storage capacity at three fuel storage depots in China. The SEC's litigation against Toups is ongoing.  The SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force and Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. Investors can also use the SALI feature to find information about certain people who have had judgments or orders issued against them in SEC court actions or administrative proceedings.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jeffrey D. Felder and Daniel M. Konosky, and was supervised by Kimberly L. Frederick and Kurt L. Gottschall. The SEC's litigation against Dreslin and Michael Toups will be led by Mark L. Williams and supervised by Gregory Kasper.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Florida-based accountant and his wife, a former registered representative, for their role in a fraudulent scheme to create and sell a public shell company.  According to the SEC's complaint, David G. Dreslin, Michael Toups, and Leslie A. Toups created a phony business plan to make it appear as though Anglesea Enterprises, Inc. was a legitimate Internet marketing company and concealed their control of the company from the tax clients. The SEC alleges that, beginning in 2011, the two men formed a private company called Angelsea and began filing false and misleading SEC filings in connection with the scheme. In addition, they allegedly used a tax client to obtain over-the-counter trading clearance for the companies' stock, which allowed them to sell their shares at inflated prices without having to pay a set return to investors. As alleged in the complaint further, in an effort to conceal the fraud, Leslie and David D. Dreslin secretly drafted and signed documents that concealed the false statements and omissions that they made to a court-appointed auditor to justify the sale of their company's stock. Finally, on or about August 10, 2009, Desslin and Dusslin consented to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 10(b)(1), and Sections 21(d)(2) and 17a-1 of Securities Exchange Act Rules of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or in any other court proceeding, Defendants have agreed to permanently enjoin them from future violations of these provisions and to disgorge the ill-gotten gains they received as a result of participating in their scheme with prejudgment interest. They have also agreed not to participate in future SEC enforcement actions, including a permanent injunction, an order imposing officer and director bars against them and a temporary restraining order against their companies from engaging in other securities fraud activities, or to conduct a penny stock offering or other similar activity, under the supervision of an outside auditor.

Generated Summary:
On March 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an order requiring the SEC to produce all non-privileged documents responsive to an investigative subpoena issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, alleges that American Bondholders Foundation, LLC (ABF), LLC, (a subsidiary of American BONDHOLDERS) filed an emergency subpoena on August 3, 2017, seeking documents related to that subpoena. ABF has agreed to the subpoena and to cooperate in the production of the documents, which is subject to court approval. The court has also granted an expedited hearing to determine whether the Commission's subpoena will be effective until April 6, 2019, and a hearing is scheduled for May 29, in which the Court will determine the amount of documents required. In a parallel action, Judge Matthew F. Kennelly has granted the request for a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of any subpoenas. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a final order on March 8, announcing that the court would order the filing of an administrative subpoena against American Depositary Fund, Inc., an entity wholly controlled by American Bankers and Trust Co., and its subsidiary, AbF. As a result of this order, both parties have agreed not to further violate the federal securities laws or to conduct any further investigation into the issue. An SEC investigation was conducted by Matthew E. Kelleher and supervised by Marc A. Mascianica, with the assistance of John M. Rymas, a Denver-based attorney and public information officer, under the supervision of Mr. Kennedy.

Actual Summary: 
On October 25, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mohammed Ali Rashid, a former senior partner at Apollo Management L.P., with defrauding his fund clients by secretly billing them for approximately $290,000 in personal expenditures, including his family vacations, visits to a hair salon, and purchases of designer clothing and high-end electronics.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid falsely claimed that certain individuals accompanied him to dinners to make it appear various personal expenses had a business purpose, and he doctored a receipt in an effort to justify his purchase of a $3,500 suit for his father as a business expense.  According to the SEC's complaint, despite being caught by the firm and told to stop on two occasions in 2010 and 2012, Rashid continued to expense personal items to clients into 2013.  After he was confronted about his expenses for a third time, Rashid admitted that he charged approximately $220,000 in personal expenses.  A forensic accountant then uncovered additional personal expenses that Rashid improperly charged to clients.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid violated, and in the alternative aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks penalties and injunctive relief.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Mohammed Ali Rashid, a Senior Partner at Apollo Management, L.P., a multi-billion dollar investment advisory firm, alleging that he defrauded his fund clients by using their money for personal expenses, including paying for elaborate vacations, frequent trips to an expensive hair salon, and luxuzy retail items.  According to the SEC's complaint, from at least January 2010 to June 2013, Rashids allegedly misappropriated approximately $290,000 from Apollo funds. The complaint further alleges that during the Relevant Period, he falsely claimed that the private equity funds were for business-related purposes and sought reimbursement for the expenses. In fact, the complaint alleges, during that time, Rashid sought over one thousand personal items and services from the funds to cover the costs of his father's visits to a salon. Later in 2010, Apollo discovered the alleged fraudulent conduct and required Rashesid to pay a penalty of $1,100, which he agreed to in exchange for a one-time payment of a portion of the $2,500 he allegedly charged to his client's family for holidays and other special occasions. After the settlement was entered into in December, 2016, it was determined that Rashedid had violated the fiduciary duties of Apollo and the company he worked for, by submitting false expense reports to obtain approval to conduct business expenses he claimed were unrelated to Apollo's investments and to reimburse the client for these expenses without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's Complaint, as well as other SEC related matters, such as whether or not he violated Section 206(1)(a) and (2)(b) of that company's Investment Advisers Act and by failing to disclose certain of these violations in his SEC filings. Additionally, in a separate SEC complaint filed in federal district court in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a temporary restraining order halting the entry of any further violations of those provisions, or ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, to be paid in full and permanently enjoined him from future violations.

Washington D.C., March 22, 2018 - This past week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former chief information officer of a U.S. business unit of Equifax with insider trading in advance of the company's September 2017 announcement about a massive data breach that exposed the social security numbers and other personal information of about 148 million U.S. customers.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jun Ying, who was next in line to be the company's global CIO, allegedly used confidential information entrusted to him by the company to conclude that Equifax had suffered a serious breach.  The SEC alleges that before Equifax's public disclosure of the data breach, Ying exercised all of his vested Equifax stock options and then sold the shares, reaping proceeds of nearly $1 million.  According to the complaint, by selling before public disclosure of the data breach, Ying avoided more than $117,000 in losses.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia announced parallel criminal charges against Ying.  The SEC's complaint charges Ying with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries.  The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Generated Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a former employee of Equifax Inc. for insider trading in advance of the company's September 2017 public disclosure of a massive data breach.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jun Ying, who was employed as an information technology and human resources manager at a Georgia-based credit reporting company, used confidential information entrusted to him by his employer to conclude that the breach was a business opportunity for an unnamed client. The SEC alleges that, in an effort to prevent future breaches, Ying exercised all of his vested security options and sold the remaining shares in the same company. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia issued a subpoena seeking information on the identity and security of approximately 143 million customers, including those affected by the September 2015 breach, and ordered Ying to pay a civil penalty of $117,000, plus prejudgment interest, as well as a court order prohibiting Ying from working on projects related to this breach until after the public announcement of it. Ying also agreed to a temporary restraining order that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders him to disgorge his losses plus interest and penalties equal to those avoided by Ying and those who were not informed that he was the victim of an alleged cyber-security breach in connection with the case. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC complaint or providing any other evidence to back up the claims, however, it is alleged that Ying violated the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws and consented to an asset freeze and a cease-and-desist order from the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 10(b)(2)(A), and Rules 5(c) of that same court and Order 5 (b) from that court, which is subject to final approval of both of those provisions. As a result of these court orders and the order Ying will be enjoined from participating in any future securities fraud activities, he will also be barred from serving on any federal or state regulatory advisory board or advisory committee.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an enforcement action against an Atlanta-area resident who allegedly misused more than $1.2 million in investments intended to support national security-related businesses and the development of a high-performance submarine vessel.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Timothy S. Batchelor misspent approximately half of the $2.4 million he raised from a handful of investors through an investment fund called Specter Ventures Fund II. For example, Batchelor allegedly used nearly a quarter-million dollars in investor funds to purchase new vehicles and approximately $225,000 to pay student loans. Batchelor also allegedly transferred thousands of dollars in investor funds to other family members.  According to the SEC's complaint, Batchelor later tried to cover his tracks by belatedly fabricating a document in November 2015 describing the unauthorized expenditures as a "loan" taken in February 2015.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Batchelor was not registered with the SEC in any capacity at the time he raised funds through Specter. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Batchelor violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The complaint seeks disgorgement plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctions against Batchelor.  The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Robert Schroeder.

According to the complaint, in November 2015, after learning that Specter Ventures Fund, LLC had raised over $2.4 million in investor funds, he allegedly used a portion of the funds raised to invest in "portfolio companies"engaged in various businesses related to national security, as well as the development of a high performance submarine vessel. As alleged in the Complaint, this was a fraud and deceit, and the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties, a permanent injunction, an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against him from future violations of Section 10(b) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission's investigation was conducted by David M. Mascianica and supervised by Michael J. Rymas, with assistance from the Atlanta Regional Office. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this complaint or in any other SEC filings, Batchetlor has consented to be barred from serving as an officer or director of an SEC enforcement agency and from participating in or providing assistance to any SEC-related entity. He has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $250,000 and to a $500,00 bar, which is subject to court approval. In addition to violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and 18(c)(1), the Commission is seeking an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating Section 17.a. and (2)(A)(3) in order to prevent them from acting as officers or directors of any such entity, including, among other things, officers, directors, or officers of companies that operate under the supervision of officers and/or directors.

On December 1, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his company, PlexCorps, in an emergency action to halt an alleged Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud that raised up to $15 million from thousands of investors. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps marketed and sold securities called PlexCoin on the internet to investors in the U.S. and elsewhere, claiming that investments in PlexCoin would yield a 1,354 percent profit in less than 29 days. The SEC also charged Lacroix's partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, in connection with the scheme.  Based on its filing, the SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of PlexCorps, Lacroix, and Paradis-Royer.  The SEC's complaint charges Lacroix, Paradis-Royer, and PlexCorps with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The complaint also alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties.  For Lacroix, the SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar and a bar from offering digital securities against Lacroix and Paradis-Royer.
Generated Summary:
On December 1, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court in the Eastern District of New York, alleging that a Quebec-based company, PlexCorps, and its Canadian partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, fraudulently raised more than $15 million from thousands of investors through an initial coin offering (ICO).  The SEC's complaint alleges that Lacroix, who is also a recidivist, misappropriated investor funds and engaged in other deceptive acts, including by promising investors returns of 1.354% in under 29 days.  According to the complaint, in an effort to skirt registration requirements of the federal securities laws and avoid liability for violations of Section 17(a)(1)(A) and Section 10(b)(5)(C) thereunder and Sections 5(c), 20(d), and 22(A)(3) in connection with the offering of securities. The complaint further alleges, without admitting or denying the allegations, that the funds were illegally raised through the fraudulent offering and by trading in unregistered securities that were not intended for business development but instead were intended to fund the company's expenses including home decor projects. In other words, investors could expect "enormous" and "real" returns on investments made in these securities, despite having signed an undertaking that they would not conduct any additional securities transactions in violation of those provisions. Finally, defendants agreed to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties, as well as a civil penalty of $250,000, which will be determined by a court order enjoining them from future violations and from violating the securities registration and registration provisions of these federal laws. Additionally, they will also be barred from serving as officers or directors of any securities companies or entities under their control from participating in any future offering or solicitation of funds, either directly or indirectly, by virtue of having consented to or having agreed not to participate in such an offering.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, charges Zimliki and Schiefer with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Zimliki and Schiefer agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits.  The SEC acknowledges the significant assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter.

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New Jersey-based broker with misusing his access to customers' brokerage accounts to enrich himself and family members at the expense of his customers, many of whom entrusted him with their retirement accounts. The SEC uncovered the alleged fraud with data analysis used to detect suspicious trading patterns.  The SEC filed fraud charges in federal district court against Michael A. Bressman of Montville, New Jersey, alleging that he misused his access to an omnibus or "allocation" account to obtain at least $700,000 in illicit trading profits over a six-year period ending in February. The SEC's complaint alleges that Bressman placed trades using the allocation account and cherry-picked profitable trades, which he then transferred to his own account and the account of two family members, while placing unprofitable trades in other customers' accounts. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Bressman.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, charges Bressman with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and a related SEC antifraud rule.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the former president of a Tennessee-based energy company with concealing from investors that two convicted criminals ran the company and led a $15 million oil investment scheme affecting more than 150 investors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the former president of Southern Energy Group, Inc., Robert William Dorrance, misled investors by failing to disclose that the two individuals actually were running the company instead of Dorrance. Last year, the SEC charged the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling investors that the funds would be used to acquire interests in wells and to recover oil from wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for their personal use. With no background in the oil industry, Dorrance's main work experience was as a former stereo salesman. He largely performed clerical and administrative work at the direction of the two convicted criminals.  Dorrance agreed to be permanently prohibited from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay $101,075 in disgorgement plus interest, and $42,500 in civil penalties, for a total of $143,575.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being handled by Brian M. Basinger, Stephen E. Donahue, and Edward G. Sullivan, all from the agency's Atlanta office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the U.S. Secret Service.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

According to the SEC's complaint, between January 2015 and February 2016, David Dorrance, a former figurehead executive for SEG Energy Group, Inc. (SEG), and its principal salesman, Richard P.

In violation of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, they also violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 15(b) and 15 (c)(3)(A)(2) in connection with the registration renewal requirements for certain companies and entities that they controlled and operated, including those controlled by the defendants. Without admitting or denying the allegations in this SEC Complaint, Mr. Dorrance has agreed to pay disgorgement of approximately $166,250 plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, which he will disgorge with interest and a civil penalty of over $250,000 and to be enjoined from future violations of these and other securities law provisions, as well as from violating the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from participating in any future fraud or other such scheme.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Akorn, Inc., a Lake Forest, Illinois pharmaceutical company, its former CFO, Timothy Dick, and its former Controller, David Hebeda, based on financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls violations by Akorn (specifically violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder). Akorn, Dick and Hebeda agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.  According to the Commission's complaint, in May 2016, Akorn restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2014 acknowledging material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related, in relevant part, to controls surrounding the company's gross-to-net reserve accounts and estimates. In its restatement, the company also disclosed that it overstated net revenue for 2014 by approximately 7 percent and income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2014 by approximately 136 percent. Akorn's material weaknesses persisted over multiple reporting periods and contributed to Akorn's materially inaccurate 2014 financial statements.  The complaint also alleges that in 2014, Dick, as CFO, and Hebeda, as Controller, had supervisory responsibilities for Akorn's internal accounting controls, gross-to-net revenue accounting and revenue recognition, and exercised control over these company functions. The Commission's complaint charges Dick and Hebeda with control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for Akorn's violations.  Akorn consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Exchange Act. Dick and Hebeda consented to the entry of orders: (a) permanently enjoining each of them from controlling any person liable for violations of the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Exchange Act; and (b) imposing a $20,000 civil penalty against each of them.  The investigation was conducted by Michael Mueller and Timothy Tatman.
Generated Summary:
On February 26, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, alleging that Akorn, Inc. and its CFO Timothy Dick violated the company's internal control over financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls violations.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from 2013 to 2014, when the Hi-Tech acquisition and alliances formed between several large wholesalers and certain retail customers in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, it did not have sufficient controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in determination of significant estimates and accounting transactions. The complaint further alleges, in a parallel action, that Dick and Hebeda misappropriated approximately $2.9 million of revenue for a portion of a transaction with one of its wholesaler customers despite having supervisory responsibilities for all of the transactions, including those related to gross-to-net revenue adjustments and inventory reserves. In addition, according to the complaint, after the acquisition was announced in July 2014 and was subject to significant price increases and to a series of accounting adjustments that were not properly accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and were used to determine the value of certain assets. According to The Commission, this was the first time that a company had disclosed material weaknesses in its internal controls for calculating revenue and expenses for its retail and wholesale customers. As a result of these weaknesses and other material limitations, there have been numerous other violations, such as the unauthorized accounting of unreported revenue deductions and the use of non-recurring expenses in connection with the purchase and sale of high-end consumer products, as well as accounting accounting and revenue recognition errors. Additionally, some of this material weakness was discovered in Akorns' financial statements for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2014 through September 30 of 2014. These errors were identified by the SEC as being consistent with its policies and practices, which required it to properly recognize revenue, expenses and liabilities for each of those transactions and agreed to detailed support from the Audit Committee. Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Dick has consented to be barred from serving as an officer or director of an SEC-certified company and has agreed not to participate in any future SEC litigation or to pay a penalty.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut investment advisory firm and its chief executive officer with putting $19 million of investor money, including elderly investors' retirement savings and pension plans, in risky investments and secretly pocketing hefty commissions from those investments.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Temenos Advisory, Inc. and George L. Taylor steered advisory clients and other investors, including senior citizens and individuals approaching retirement, into four risky, illiquid private offerings. While Temenos and Taylor charged advisory fees for unbiased financial advice, they allegedly concealed from their clients the high commissions they were pocketing from these risky and unsuitable investment recommendations, including cash and ownership stakes in the private companies they recommended, and fraudulently misled clients about the risks and prospects of the investments. The SEC also alleges that Temenos and Taylor grossly overbilled some of their advisory clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Connecticut, charges Temenos and Taylor with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Generated Summary:
On July 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Connecticut-based investment advisers with defrauding their advisory clients and prospective clients by steering them into unsuitable investments and by hiding commissions and other financial incentives from their clients.  The SEC's complaint alleges that George L. Taylor and his company, Temenos Advisory, Inc. (Temenos) violated the fiduciary duty that every investment adviser owes to its clients, including those who invested in private placement companies. According to the complaint, from 2014 through 2017, Taylor, at Taylor's direction and under his signature, solicited investments in companies that he advised. In addition, he repeatedly downplayed or concealed potential gains, associated with a series of illiquid private placements that Taylor advised his clients to invest in. As alleged in the Complaint, in violation of Section 15(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1934, it was illegal for Taylor to conduct due diligence on any of these investments, and he was liable for the alleged violations of Sections 206(e) and 206 (a)(2)(A)(1) in connection with these violations. Without admitting or denying the allegations, however, both defendants have agreed to pay a total of $225,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, as well as a civil penalty, to be determined by the U.S. Attorney's Office for Connecticut and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The settlement is subject to court approval.The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorge and a penalty against Taylor for violating the antifraud provisions of this federal securities law, along with civil injunctions against him from future violations and an order to halt the sale of securities in which he allegedly had undisclosed conflicts of interest.
