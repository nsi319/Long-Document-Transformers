Case No. COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges: SUMMARY 1. Defendants Leroy ﬁLeeﬂ K. Y oung and Young Capital Management LLC (ﬁYCMﬂ) orchestrated the fraudulent and unregistered sale of securities.  From January 2013 through Decembe r 2017, Defendants illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false pr omises of high returns on their principal investment.

Young falsely represented that he would use the investors™ money for fees associated with selling bonds or, altern ately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund, when in reality he simply spent the investors™ money on personal expenses.  Young also falsely told investor s that he would pay the promised returns from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offe rings, which never occurred.   Young said that he could generate returns of ten times investors™ principal investment in sixty days.  To date, Young has not paid his investors the promised returns nor returned any of their principal investments. 3. By engaging in this c onduct, Defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ), Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exch ange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The SEC brings this action pursu ant to the authority conferred by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. 5. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 6. Defendants have, directly or indi rectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and course of business alleged in this complaint. 7. Venue is proper in this district pur suant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] a nd Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)] because certain of the offers and sales of securities and certain of the acts and transactions constituting the violations of the federal securities laws alleged in this Complaint occurred within this distri ct.  In addition, Defendants inhabit and transact business in this district.  Spec ifically, Defendant Young resides in Solano Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.2   Page 2 of 9   2   12                         28Beach, California, and Defendant YCM™s principal place of business is in Carlsbad, California. THE DEFENDANTS 8. Defendant Leroy ﬁLeeﬂ K. Young of Solana Beach, California is the sole member and owner of YCM.  Sinc e 2014, Young™s only employment and source of income has been raising money from inve stors.  Young is not currently registered or associated with any entity registered with the Commission. 9. Defendant Young Capital Management, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Carlsbad, California.  YCM has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. STATEMENT OF FACTS 10. From January 2013 through Decemb er 2017, Young and YCM obtained a total of at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme that included material misrepre sentations and other deceptive conduct. Young and YCM sold investors securities and falsely promised investors a return of ten times their initial investme nt in sixty days.     11. Young and YCM broadly solicited investors from multiple states through, among other means, emails, phone ca lls, and the Internet.  Young identified one investor using the social network LinkedIn.  The majority of Young™s investors were referred to him by two individuals w ho also invested personally.  Young did not ask potential investors about their income, net worth, or prior investment experience.   12. To induce individuals to invest , Young knowingly or recklessly made numerous materially false statements in telephone conversations and e-mails.  Young promised investors a return of ten times their principal in sixty days.  Young told  investors that he would use their money for legal fees or other expenses associated with a bond or hedge fund offering (which he sometimes called the ﬁYoung Capital Management Bondﬂ or ﬁYoung Capital Managementﬂ fund), and that he would pay investors™ returns from the proceeds of the offering.  In fact, Young never conducted Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 9   3   12                         28a bond or hedge fund offering.  Instead, Young spent nearly all of the investors™ funds on personal expenses, such as dining, shopping, and entertainment. 13. Young further lied to investors a bout the bond or hedge fund offering.  He falsely claimed to investors that he had partnered with large broker-dealers to conduct the offering.  In fact, Young never partnered with any broker-dealer in connection with any securities offering.   14. Young also frequently told potentia l investors that he had extensive experience with the type of investment he was offering and that it could not fail.  These statements were false and mislea ding because Young had no prior experience conducting bond or hedge fund offerings. 15. For example, on August 12, 2016, Young met with Investor A.  Young told Investor A that he was raising mone y to pay legal fees for a $100 million bond offering called the ﬁYoung Capital Manageme nt Bond.ﬂ  Young identified three large broker-dealers as ﬁadministrators of the bond.ﬂ  Young told Investor A that if he invested $20,000, he would receive a return of $200,000 in sixty days.  Young said that Investor A™s principal would be held in an escrow account and would be returned to him if the bond offering did not occur. Young also told Investor A that he had done many of these types of bond offerings in the past. 16. In another example, on June 23 , 2017, Young spoke with Investor B over the phone.  Young told Investor B that he had recently left a large broker-dealer and was conducting bond offerings with his former coll eagues.  Young told Investor B that if he invested $5,000, he would receive a return of $50,000 in sixty days. 17. After soliciting their investments through material misrepresentations, Young provided contracts to each investor. The contracts also falsely stated that investors would receive a ten times return on their investment in sixty days ﬁin regard to a transaction or transactions,ﬂ without further explanation.  For example, for one individual who invested $15,000, the agreement stated:  ﬁClient will be paid $150,000 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) in sixty (60) days in regard to a Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.4   Page 4 of 9   4   12                         28transaction or transactions.ﬂ 18. Young™s promise of ﬁten timesﬂ retu rns in sixty days was false.  Young did not provide investors with any returns within sixty da ys of their investments and knew or was reckless in not knowing that these representations were false at the time that he made them.  Such returns would ha ve been impossible because, rather than investing investors™ funds in any security that could have potentially provided a return, Young simply spent the money on hims elf.  To date, Young has not returned any money to investors. 19. Based on Young™s (and through Young, YCM™s) material misrepresentations, investors agreed to i nvest in securities that took the form of investment contracts.  Sales of securities must be registered with the SEC unless an exemption from the registration requirements applies. 20. During all relevant times, Young™s and YCM™s offering of investment contracts was required to be registered under the securities laws.  Young and YCM™s offering was not registered with the SEC and was not subject to any relevant exemption from registration. 21. Young and YCM obtained $362,000 fr om investors by means of their materially false statements and the illegal, unregistered sales of investment contracts to them.   22. To some investors, Young held himsel f out as an investment adviser to a purported hedge fund, YCM. 23. Young and YCM engaged in additiona l deceptive conduct in furtherance of the scheme by funneling investors™ funds through a self-employed attorney working with Young.  Young directed investors to wire their investment funds to a  trust account maintained by the attorney.  Young told investors that their principal would safely remain in escrow until the bo nd or hedge fund offering was complete. 24. Young™s representation that investor s™ money would remain in escrow was also false.  At Young™s instruction, the attorney transferred the investors™ money Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.5   Page 5 of 9   5   12                         28to Young™s personal bank account either on the day of receipt or the next day.  Young then immediately began spending the inve stors™ money on his personal expenses. 25. Young™s misrepresentations to inve stors about his relevant experience and industry access, the safety of the investment, and the high returns of the investment were material to investors. 26. When pressed by investors for prom ised returns, repayment of their initial investment, or status updates on their investments, Young concealed his misappropriation of their money by making more false statements.  Young sent emails to investors stating variously that he was ﬁin a lawsuit to refund [their] money,ﬂ ﬁgetting very close to getting a re fund on [their] investment,ﬂ ﬁdoing a 144A Bond Offering in the next 30-60 days which will return 9X your money,ﬂ and ﬁgoing to start selling the bonds [him]self to institutional investorsﬂ in a ﬁbond offering now scheduled for January 8.ﬂ  At the time he made these statements, Young knew that they were false.  In fact, there was no lawsuit, there was no planned bond offering, and Young was never ﬁcloseﬂ to refunding investors™ money.

Dated:  September 19, 2018 /s/ David Mendel__________________ David Mendel Attorney for Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission Case 3:18-cv-02170-CAB-MDD   Document 1   Filed 09/19/18   PageID.9   Page 9 of 9","On September 19, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San Diego County, California resident Leroy ""Lee"" Young and his firm, Young Capital Management LLC (YCM), for conducting fraudulent sales of unregistered securities.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from January 2013 through December 2017, Young and YCM illegally raised at least $362,000 from at least 32 investors through false promises of high returns on their principal investment. According to the SEC's complaint, Young falsely represented that he would use the investors' money for fees associated with selling bonds or, alternately, for fees associated with launching a hedge fund. The complaint also alleges that Young falsely told investors that he would pay returns of ten times their principal investment in sixty days, generated from the proceeds of bond or hedge fund offerings. In reality, according to the complaint, Young spent the investors' money on personal expenses, and he has not paid returns to investors or repaid their principal investments.  Young and YCM admitted the allegations in the complaint and have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5, and the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Young to pay disgorgement of $336,450, prejudgment interest of $18,923, and a civil penalty of $336,450. The proposed settlement is subject to Court approval. Based on the anticipated entry of an injunction, Young has agreed to the issuance of an SEC order that permanently bars him from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in an offering of a penny stock.  The SEC also brought settled administrative proceedings against Michael L. LaPenna and Kentucky-based lawyer Phillip R. Grogan. According to the SEC's orders, LaPenna recruited investors by making material misrepresentations about Young's investment program, and Grogan facilitated the transfer of investor funds through his trust account, giving investors the false and misleading impression that their principal was safely escrowed with an attorney. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, LaPenna agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $22,500, prejudgment interest of $583, and a $22,500 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Grogan agreed to the issuance of an order finding that he caused Young's antifraud violations; imposing a cease-and-desist order; and requiring the payment of disgorgement of $3,050, prejudgment interest of $248, and a $3,050 civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Emily Shea and supervised by Kevin Guerrero and Antonia Chion."

( )JiiRY DEMANDEDPlaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"" or""Commission"") alleges as follows:~~521. This case centers on a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by Defendant Brent Borlandthrough two entities that he owned and controlled: (1) Borland Capital Group, LLC (""BCG"") and(2) Belize Infrastructure Fund I, LLC (""Belize Fund"").Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 1 of 22 2. Although Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund (collectively, ""Defendants"") usedmultiple holding companies and over a dozen bank accounts to perpetrate their fraud, theirunderlying scheme was simple. Between 2014 and June of 2017, Defendants sold at least $21.9million of promissory notes (the ""Notes"") to at least 44 investors in at least eight states.Defendants promised investors that their money would be used as bridge financing to fundconstruction and development of aninternational airport in Placentia, Belize (the ""PlacentiaAirport""). But, rather than use all of the funds asrepresented, Borland misappropriated morethan$5.98 million of investor assets and used the stolen principal to fund his family's lavishlifestyle.3. Borland funneled investor funds to himself and his family using the account ofanother entity under his control, Relief Defendant Canyon Acquisitions, LLC (""Canyon"") Š aholding company owned by Borland and his wife, Relief Defendant Alana LaTorra Borland(""Alana""}. From Canyon's account, Borland used investor funds to pay his family's expenses,including: (a) mortgage and property tax payments on the Borlands' multi-million dollar Floridamansion, (b) multiple luxury automobiles, (c) tuition for the Borlands' children at anelite privateschool, (d) $36,000 for the Borlands' membership at a posh beach club in Delray Beach, Florida,(e) nearly $ I0,000 for high-end watches, and (fl almost $2.7 million to pay off Alana's creditcards.4. While Borland and his family enjoyed the benefits of at least $5.98 million inpurloined investor cash, Note investors were not so lucky. The maturity dates on almost all, ifnot all, of the Notes have passed without repayment and all of the Notes have slipped intodefault. To this day, the overwhelming majority of Note investors have been paid none of whatthey are owed Š no interest payments and no return of principal.2Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 2 of 22 In the course of the fraud, Defendants repeatedly lied to Šand hid materialinformation from Šinvestors. In addition to lying about the use of investor funds, Defendantspromised outlandish returns with quick payment terms. But, while selling the Notes to newinvestors, Defendants hid the fact that the overwhelming majority of prior Notes were in defaultand prior Note investors had not been paid a dime of interest or principal.6. To make matters worse, Defendants perpetuated their fraudulent scheme bysecretly re-pledging the same collateral to multiple investors. Defendants led investors to believethat their Notes were secured by valuable real estate that was (a) worth at least twice as much asthe amount of the Note, (b) secured only that individual Note, and (c) would not be encumberedby any other liens or security interests. In reality, Borland pledged the same pazcels of real estateto multiple investors and reported fake valuations for the properties to investors to make itappear that the parcels were worth twice the face value of the Note.7. By making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors, and byengaging in a fraudulent offering scheme, Borland, BCG and Belize Fund have committedsecurities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. §78j(b}] and Rule lOb-5 thereunder (17 C.F.R. 240.1Ob-5] andSection 17(a} of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)].8. Borland's family Šincluding Alana and his mother in-law Šbenefited fromDefendants' fraud. And, the money that Borland took from investors to fund his family'slifestyle was only a fraction of the more than $14.4 million of investor funds that Borlandfunneled through Canyon. Canyon and Alana have no legitimate claim to the investor funds thatthey received as a result of Defendants' fraud and, therefore, were unjustly enriched by receivingthose funds. Canyon and Alana are, therefore, proper Relief Defendants in this action.3Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 3 of 22 9. The SEC brings this lawsuit to stop Defendants' violations of the federalsecurities laws, to prevent further harm to investors, and to seek disgorgement and civil penaltiesstemming from Defendants' wrongdoing, among other remedies.JURISDICTION AND VENUE10.

Borland told investors that he and a partner in Belize hadinvested $24 million in the airport and that he needed ""bridge lenders"" to provide additional,short-term funding for airport construction while he worked to secure more substantial, long-term financing from institutional investors to complete the project.26. Borland, BCG,~ and Belize Fund promised investors unusually generous returnsand quick repayment. At a time when the federal funds rate was below 1 %per year, the Notesgenerally provided fora 15%return after 3 months and 1%per month for each month after thefirst three months, effectively offering interest of 24%per year.27. The Notes also promised a quick pay-off. Most of the Notes had a 12 or 24-monthterm. Some of the Notes provided aneven shorter term with a maturity date 3 months after thedate of the Note.28. Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund told the Note investors that the Notes were""bridge financing"" and would be repaid quickly. In fact, the Notes specified that while payment7Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 7 of 22 would be due by the maturity date, the borrower Š i. e., BCG or Belize Fund Šwould be requiredto ""pre-pay (retire)"" the Note within seven days if a target amount of investment was obtainedfor the ""Placentia International Airport Project."" In other words, payment on the Note was dueby the maturity date or when Defendants obtained long-term financing for the Placentia AirportŠwhichever came first.29. Borland told investors that he expected to close such long-term financing for thePlacentia Airport in short order because the airport was anattractive investment. Indeed,Borland told at least one investor that he ""guaranteed"" that his investment would only be for ashort term.30. Although the maturity of the Notes could be accelerated if BCG or Belize Fundobtained long-term financing for the Placentia Airport, BCG's and Belize Fund's paymentobligations on the Notes were not contingent on such financing. Each Note specified that ""[i]fthe Borrower does not satisfy all amounts due on [the Note] on the Maturity Date, the Borrowerwill be in default"" and that a penalty rate of interest would accrue until the Note was paid. Inother words, regardless of whether Defendants obtained long-term financing for the PlacentiaAirport, the Notes were in default once the maturity date passed without payment of principaland interest.31. The Notes are ""securities"" as that term is defined in Exchange Act Section3(a)(10) [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)] and Securities Act Section 2(a)(1) [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)].32. The Notes suggest the intended use of investors' principal. They specify that the""Bridge Note"" would come due once sufficient financing was obtained for the ""PlacentiaInternational Airport Project.""Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 8 of 22 33. Instead of a prospectus or offering memorandum, Borland used intermediatebrokers to introduce the investment opportunity to investors. Borland and/or his BCG employeethen offered a more detailed explanation of the investment to interested investors by telephone,e-mail, and web presentation. Borland and his BCG employee told investors during those calls,presentations, and in emails that their money would be used for construction of the PlacenciaAirport.34. Neither Borland nor his BCG employee told investors that any portion of theirNote proceeds would be paid to Borland or his family. Nor did they mention any other uses ofNote proceeds aside from the Placencia Airport.Borland's Misappropriation Of Investor Funds:35. While Borland and his entities were raising $21.9 million from Note investors,Borland took at least $5.98 million of that money to fund his lavish lifestyle.36. Borland misappropriated the vast majority of that $5.98 million of investor cashby funneling it through Canyon, anentity that he owns with his wife, Alana, and whichemployed Alana's mother. From there, Borland and Alana directed Alana's mother to issuechecks and wire transfers to pay the Borlands' personal expenses.37. From April 1, 2014 through September 29, 2017, Borland sent more than $14.4million of Note proceeds to Canyon's domestic checking account. Although Canyon had somefunds from other sources, that $14.4 million of investor cash represented more than 89% of themoney taken into Canyon's account. None of the funds in the Canyon account was transferred toaccounts in Belize or was otherwise used for construction projects in Belize.Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 9 of 22 38. Instead, Borland and his wife used the Canyon account Š and a BCG account thatalso was funded with Note proceeds Š astheir personal piggy-banks. From those accounts, theBorlands took at least $5.98 million to pay personal expenses.39. For example, between April 1, 2014 and September 29, 2017, the Borlands madethe following personal expenditures from the Canyon account that was funded withmisappropriated investor principal:(a) at least $925,785 in mortgage payments on properties owned by Borland andAlana, including their b,000 square foot, multi-million dollar Florida mansion;(b) more than $61,940 in property taxes on Borland and Alana's Florida home in2016 and 2017;(c) more than $97,000 to pay private school tuition for the Borlands' children;(d) more than $36,000 for the Borlands' membership and fees at a private beachclub and day spa in Delray Beach, Florida;(e) more than $31,000 to a high-end department store;(~ more than $11,000 in dues to Alana's mother's homeowners association;(g) a nearly $10,000 payment to anonline luxury watch website; and(h) more than $183,000.00 in cash withdrawals.40. Between Apri14, 2014 and September 29, 2017, Borland and Alana also took atleast $2.6? million from Canyon's account to pay off four credit cazd accounts in Alana's name.The credit card accounts were used primarily for personal expenses of the Borlands and none ofthe credit card charges related to airport construction in Belize.41. In addition, Borland and his wife used investor funds to buy luxury automobiles.For example:10Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 10 of 22 (a) On March 2, 2015, Borland took $25,000 from the Canyon account to make apayment on a Mercedes G63 luxury Sport Utility Vehicle (""SW"") which hasasticker price over $140,000;(b) In June 2015, Borland took $66,659.38 from a BCG account Šwhich includedco-mingled investor funds Šwhich he sent to a Cadillac dealership in EastTotowa, New Jersey; and(c) On April 27, 2017, Borland directed a second payment of $61,937.50 from thesame BCG account to the same Cadillac dealership towazd the purchase of aCadillac Escalade luxury SW.42. In total, Borland misappropriated over $5.98 million from accounts holding co-mingled investor funds to pay for his family's lavish lifestyle, including payments that benefittedAlana.43. While he solicited funds from investors and then misappropriated investor fundsfor his family's expenses, Borland Šacting through BCG, and Belize Fund Šacted with scienter.Borland knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthat the overwhelming majority of assets in theCanyon account came from Note proceeds and that money from that account was being used topay his family's personal expenses.Borland, BCG. and Belize Fund Lied To Investors About the Use of Investor Funds:44. From 2014 through at least June 2017, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund toldinvestors (and prospective investors) that their principal would be used to fund construction anddevelopment of the Placencia Airport. Similarly, term sheets Defendants provided to investorsrepresent that investors' proceeds will be used for ""operating capital."" No other use of investorprincipal was disclosed to investors.Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 11 of 22 45. Those representations were false when made. While a portion of the investedfunds may have been used to fund construction projects, Borland used at least 40% of investorfunds for other purposes. Most significantly, asdiscussed at paragraphs 35-43 above, Borlandused at least $5.98 million of investor principal to pay his family's personal expenses.46. In addition to using investor funds to pay personal expenses, Borland, BCG, andthe Belize Fund diverted Note proceeds to fund real estate projects that had no relation to Belizeconstruction projects and that were never discussed with investors. Specifically, Belize Fund sent$778,000 to a BCG account dedicated to a New York condominium investment at the New YorkRitz Carlton Residences in White Plains, New York and another luxury condominium building inNew Rochelle, New York. Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund did not tell Note investors that aportion of their principal would be used to fund investments in New York condominiums.47. Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund also diverted $1,431,568 of investor funds to paythird party brokers who introduced investors to BCG and Belize Fund.48. In sum, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund took at least $8,940,666 of investor fundsand used that money in ways that were not related to the disclosed purpose of the Notes Š i. e., tofund construction at the Placencia Airport and related projects in Belize. Those misused fundsrepresent at least 40% of the all funds raised from Note investors.49. Defendants' misrepresentations to Note investors regarding use of funds werematerial. In making aninvestment decision, a reasonable investor would deem it important that Šinstead of using investor funds aspromised (i. e., to fund the construction of Placentia Airport) Šapproximately 40% of investor funds was diverted for other purposes, including unrelated realestate projects, investor commissions, and over $5.98 million for the Borlands' personalexpenses.12Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 12 of 22 50. In making the misrepresentations and omissions identified above, Borland, BCG,and Belize Fund acted with scienter. At the time they told prospective investors about the natureof their investment, Borland, BCG, and the Belize Fund knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthatthe representations were not true and that they had diverted a significant portion of investorfunds for Borland's personal use and for other purposes unrelated to construction projects inBelize.Defendants' Fraudulent Pledging of the Sarae Collateral to Multiple Investors:51. All Note investors received pledges of collateral as ""security"" for their notes. Ascollateral, Borland pledged pazcels of real estate in Belize purportedly owned by Mayan LagoonEstates, LTD {""Mayan Estates""). All of the pledges of Mayan Estates pazcels were signed byBorland and one of his purported Belizean partners.52. The collateral pledge documents prohibited the pledged parcels of land frombeing transferred or encumbered in any way during the term of the pledge. With minor languagedeviations, the pledge documents each state that BCG and the Belize Fund ""shall not transferorencumber in any way this pledged property. Pledgor shall not permit any mortgages or liens toattach to the pledged property until the loan is repaid in its entirety.""53. Despite the fact that the pledge documents prohibited the pledged property frombeing transferred or encumbered in any way during the term of the pledge, Borland, BCG andBelize Fund pledged the same pazcels of property to multiple investors.54. Most investors were affected by this practice, asapproximately 77% of the Noteswere secured by collateral that Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund surreptitiously pledged to otherinvestors.13Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 13 of 22 5~. For example, between .l~ebruary and June of 201 ~, Borland pledged the sameparcel of land Šdescribed as `'Placencia Narth Block 36 Parcel 2169 .Known as Lot 84 of thesubdivision"" Š as collateral to secure Notes of at least 12 different investors. Borland did notinform any of the 12 investors that their collateral secured other Notes.~6. As another example, the below chart reflects three instances where the sameparcel of land Šdescribed as ""Lot 31"" Šwas pledged to secure three dii'ferent Notes withinweeks of one another in June of 2016:The Surreptitious Re-Pledging ~f Lot 31 t~ Three Investors`Date ofNote.:.9iS++iTerni""""of~Tute-«end`.~12Investor4mount of ~NotePledged :l,ot.t..Durationof Pied~e'.3.'

Borland signed each of the Collateral Pledge t-lgreements securing the three Notesidentified iii the above table. Each Collateral fledge Agreement stated that: ""Prior to obtaining[the investor's] written consent, [Mayan Estates] shall not transfer or encumber in any way thispledged property. [Mayan Estates] shall not perniit any mortgages or liens to attach to thepledged property unfit the loan is repaid in its entirety."" Despite that fact, after using Lot 31 tosecure the mote for Investor ~, I3orl~ind encumbered Lot 31 ~~~ith two additional security interests~y re-pledging it as collateral to secure the Notes for Investor B and Investor C.~s. In the case of the three investors identif ed in the above table, Borland not onlyimproperly pledged the same collateral simultaneously to each ~f the three investors, hedisclosed a very different valuation for the collateral each time he pled4~ed it. Each time hepledged Lot 31 as collateral, Borland assigned ~ value to the lot designed to make it appear thatt}~e lit vas worth t~~ice tl~e amatint of the Note in~restmet~t.14Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 14 of 22 59. Specifically, in the 24-day period between the three Notes, Borland disclosedthree different valuations for Lot 31, ranging between $200,000 and $2,000,000. If Lot 31 evenexists, at least two Šand possibly all three Š of the valuations that Borland provided for Lot 31were fake.60. Borland's secret re-pledging of the same collateral to multiple investors ŠandBorland's disclosure of wildly different valuations for the same collateral for each Note itsecured Šwas material. Borland, BCG, and the Belize Fund told investors that the collateralpledges would be exclusive. In making aninvestment decision, a reasonable investor would havefound it important that their collateral was securing the Notes of other investors. Suchduplicative pledging necessarily reduces the value of the collateral to any one investor andreduces the chance that the collateral Š if it exists at all Šcould be used to secure the investmentin the event of default. A reasonable investor also would find it important that the identifiedcollateral was assigned radically different valuations when securing other Notes.61. In pledging the same collateral to multiple investors Šand assigning substantiallydifferent values to the same pazcels when pledging the parcel to secure multiple Notes ŠBorland,BCG, and Belize Fund acted with scienter. Borland signed each of the Notes on behalf of BCGand Belize Fund and signed each of the collateral pledge documents related to those Notes.When he signed, Borland knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthat (1) the same parcels of realestate were being pledged to secure multiple Notes, (2) the collateral pledge documents expresslyprohibited the Defendants from encumbering the collateral once pledged (effectively barring theDefendants from pledging the same parcel to multiple investors), and (3) the collateral pledgedocuments assigned very different valuations to the same parcel when securing multiple Notes(reflecting that at least some of the valuations were fake).15Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 15 of 22 Defendants Fail to Tell New Note Purchasers That Older Notes Were In Default:62. With few exceptions, investors in the Notes have never received any interestpayments or a return of any portion of their principal. Over the course of the scheme, virtuallyall, if not all, of the Notes have entered default as the maturity dates passed without repayment.63. In marketing the Notes to Investors, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund touted theinvestment potential of the Placencia Airport and assured investors that they would be repaid ontime (if not before).64. But, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund failed to disclose to new Note investors thatthe overwhelming majority of prior Note investors had not been paid and that the prior Noteswere in default.65. For example, on Apri18, 2015, Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund sold a $150,000Note to Investor D. That note provided for repayment in three months. But at that time, BelizeFund already was in default on nearly $3 million of Notes it had sold to prior investors. Like theNote sold to Investor D, the earlier notes provided for repayment in three months. Before hemade his investment on the expectation that he would be repaid in three months, Investor D wasnot told that Belize Fund already had defaulted on nearly identical Notes with the same 3-monthterm.66. Investor D's Note has long passed its July 8, 2015 maturity date. But Š to this dayŠInvestor D has not been paid any interest or principal.67. Similarly, on March 30, 2016, a year after Investor D purchased his note Šandover eight months after Investor D's Note entered default Š Investor E bought a $500,000 noteissued by Belize Fund. Though Investor E's Note had a 12-month term, Borland assured InvestorEthat long-term financing for the Placencia Airpart was imminent and the Note would be repaid16Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 16 of 22 within a few months. Investor E was never told that Š at the time he made his investment ŠBelize Fund already had defaulted on Notes sold to Investor D and other investors.68. As with the other Notes, Investor E's Note is now in default and Investor E hasnot received any interest or principal payments.69. Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions related to prior Note defaults werematerial. In evaluating whether to invest in the Notes, a reasonable investor would consider itimportant that substantively identical Notes issued to prior investors were in default and thatprior investors had received no interest or principal payments on their investment.70. In hiding prior Note defaults from Note investors, Borland, BCG, and BelizeFund acted with scienter. Borland signed each Note issued to investors, communicated withprospective investors about the Notes, and controlled every aspect of BCG's and Belize Fund'sinteractions with investors. In communicating with new investors, Borland, BCG, and BelizeFund knew Š or recklessly disregarded Šthat Notes issued to prior investors were in default andthat nearly all prior investors had received little if any payment on their investment.Borland Invokes the Fifth Amendment in Resaonse to Questions Posed by the SEC:71. As part of its investigation into the securities law violations identified in thisComplaint, the SEC issued subpoenas to Borland, his second-in-command at BCG, his wifeAlana, and his mother in-law, requiring each of them to appear and provide testimony under oathto the SEC regarding matters including the use of funds Borland raised from investors.72. Borland, his second-in-command, Alana, and Alana's mother each refused toprovide substantive answers to the SEC's questions and instead invoked their right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.17Case 1:18-cv-04352-PKC Document 5 Filed 05/16/18 Page 17 of 22 COUNTIViolations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act,and Exchange Act Rule lOb-5(Against Defendants Borland, BCG, and Belize Fund)73. Pazagraphs 1 through 72 are realleged and incorporated by reference.74. As more fully described in paragraphs 1 through 72, Defendants Borland, BCG,and Belize Fund, in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, by the use of the meansand instrumentalities of interstate commerce and by the use of the mails, directly and indirectly:used and employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud; made untrue statements of materialfact and onnitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in lightof the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and engaged in acts, practicesand courses of business which operated or would have operated asa fraud and deceit uponpurchasers and prospective purchasers of securities.75. As described in more detail in paragraphs 1 through 72 above DefendantsBorland, BCG, and Belize Fund each acted with scienter in that they knowingly or recklesslymade the material misrepresentations and omissions and engaged in the fraudulent schemeidentified above.76. By reason of the foregoing, Defendants Borland, BCG, and the Belize Fundviolated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)] and Rule lOb-5 thereunder [17C.F.R. 240.

By engaging in the conduct described in paragraphs 1-72 above, Borland, BCG,and the Belize Fund, in the offer and sale of securities, by the use of the means and instrumentsof interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, employed devices, schemes and artifices todefraud.79. Defendants Borland, BCG, and the Belize Fund intentionally or recklesslyengaged in the devices, schemes, and artifices","On May 16, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Brent Borland and two of his companies with misappropriating close to $6 million in investor funds intended to finance an international airport in Belize.  The SEC's complaint alleges that between 2014 and 2017, Brent Borland sold more than $21 million of promissory notes to dozens of investors, promising that the funds would be used as bridge financing for development of an international airport in Placencia, Belize and that the investments would be protected by pledges of real estate as collateral. Borland marketed and sold the notes through two companies, Borland Capital Group LLC, which purports to be active in ""alternative investment,"" and Belize Infrastructure Fund I, LLC, which purports to be in the business of construction finance.  The complaint alleges that Borland used millions of dollars of investor funds for personal expenses and unrelated business expenses, including mortgage and property tax payments on his family's Florida mansion, multiple luxury automobiles, private school tuition for his children, $36,000 for his family's beach club membership, and almost $2.7 million to pay off credit cards. Borland also allegedly deceived investors by pledging the same collateral to multiple investors.  The SEC's complaint filed in the Southern District of New York alleges that Borland, BCG and Belize Fund with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks, among other relief, asset freezes as to Borland and his companies, an accounting of investor assets, disgorgement of Borland's ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. The complaint also names as relief defendants Borland's wife, Alana LaTorra Borland, and a corporation controlled by Borland and his wife, Canyon Acquisitions, LLC. The SEC seeks to recover investor proceeds that Borland transferred to the relief defendants.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Borland who was arrested earlier in the day.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by Andrew O'Brien and Donald Ryba and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC's litigation will be led by Benjamin Hanauer and Timothy Leiman."

In breach of  duty of trust and confidence , Bordian traded on this material nonpublic information about the proposed acquisition. On May 18 and 19 , 2016, Bordian purchased   personal account 290 out-of-the -money call option contracts for InterOil stock , all of which had near term expiration dates. To be exercised profitably,  market price of InterOil stock   increase significantly prior to the expiration dates, some of which expired on May 20 .   3.

Following th e public announcement, the market price of InterOil stock increased over 37% percent, closing at $43.58 per share on May 20, 2016.  That day , and during the weeks following Case 2:18-cv-10437   Document 1   Filed 06/12/18   Page 5 of 8 PageID: 5 6  the public announcement, Bordian sold all of the InterOil options contracts he had  ently acquired , making illicit profits of $220,500.

The SEC's complaint alleges that in May 2016, while working as an accountant and personal assistant for a director of InterOil Corporation, Kurt J. Bordian received e-mail messages indicating that the company was entering into a merger agreement in which its stock would be acquired at a significant premium. The complaint alleges that, shortly before the merger announcement, Bordian purchased out-of-the-money InterOil call options with near-term expiration dates, which meant that Bordian stood to profit only if InterOil's stock price rose significantly shortly after he acquired the options. As alleged in the complaint, following the merger announcement, InterOil's stock price increased over 37% percent, and Bordian sold the InterOil options contracts, making illicit profits of $220,500.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, charges Bordian with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Bordian consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, prohibits him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $220,500, prejudgment interest of $14,358, and a civil penalty of $220,500. Bordian also consented to a Commission order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian T. Fitzsimons and supervised by Brian O. Quinn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."

From approximately April 2015 through October 2015, DefendantsAdam Tracy (""Tracy"") and his law firm, Securities Compliance Group, Ltd.(""Securities Compliance"") (collectively, ""the Defendants""), knowingly and/orseverely recklessly prepared and filed materially false registration statements withthe Commission on behalf of Sonant Communications Corp. (""Sonant"").Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 1 of 14 2. At the time, Sonant was a telecommunications firm, created toprovide telecommunications services to small and medium-sized companies. It isno longer in business.3. The registration statements that were filed with the Commission inconnection with Sonant's offering of 10 million shares of common stockconcealed from the investing public that the person who actually operated andcontrolled the company was a felon who had previously been convicted ofsecurities fraud. Specifically, the filings misrepresented that certain otherindividuals were the principal officers and control persons of the company and didnot even mention the convicted felon's name or his role with the company.VIOLATIONS4. By their actions, Defendants have aided and abetted, and unlessrestrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to aid and abet violations ofSections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") [15U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1) and (3)].JURISDICTION AND VENUE5.

Tracy, age 40, resides in Wheaton, Illinois, and is a member of theIllinois State Bar.11. Securities Compliance Group, Ltd. is a law firm based in Wheaton,Illinois, that provides advice to individuals and entities regarding federal securitieslaws. Defendant Tracy is Defendant Securities Compliance's founder, presidentand managing attorney.12. Sonant Communications Corp. is an inactive Wyoming corporationwith its principal place of business in Pompano Beach, Florida. Sonant wasformed in May 2015 to provide telecommunications services to small andmedium-sized businesses. According to the Wyoming Secretary of State'swebsite, Sonant was administratively dissolved on July 9, 2016.13. The convicted felon formed Sonant and controlled it until his death inDecember 2015. In June 2005, the convicted felon pled guilty in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York to one count of conspiracy tocommit securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud, and one count of securitiesfraud. He was thereafter sentenced to a term of incarceration in a federalcorrectional facility and ordered to pay restitution.Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 4 of 14 THE FRAUDULENT SCHEMEA. The Inception of the Scheme14. In April 2015, the convicted felon communicated with the Defendantsand sought their legal assistance in (a) preparing and filing Sonant's Form S-1registration statement with the Commission, which would enable Sonant to offerits equity securities to investors, and (b) listing the company's equity securities onthe OTC marketplace.15. During their exchanges, the convicted felon advised the Defendantson more than one occasion that he had previously been arrested, and, because ofhis conviction, did not want to be named as an officer or director of Sonant anddid not want it to appear that he was associated with Sonant in public filings.16. For example, in one email to Defendants, the convicted felon stated,""I cannot be an officer of the company but will be management at a later date. Ihad an arrest about 10 years ago that maybe [sic] a conflict and I just don't thinkwe should deal with my past issues here.""17. In a subsequent email to Defendants, the convicted felon stated, ""Ihad an arrest like 10 years ago and it may be a conflict so leave me off of5Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 5 of 14 anything. I don't think we need to deal with my past here for this. Its [sic] notnecessary.""18. Based upon their direct dealings with the convicted felon, theDefendants knew that the convicted felon Šand no other person Šwas controllingSonant and that the convicted felon would continue to be the true principal officerfor and operate and control Sonant.19. In May 2015, the Defendants were involved in Sonant's incorporationin the State of Wyoming. Sonant's Articles of Incorporation listed the name of thecompany's purported Chief Executive Officer and included his purportedsignature. Sonant's bylaws listed the name of the company's purported Secretaryand included his purported signature. However, neither person had agreed toserve as an officer or director of Sonant, and their signatures on these documentswere forged.B. The Filing of Sonant's Materially False Registration Statement and theDefendants' Opinion Letter with the Commission20. In August 2015, the Defendants filed Sonant's false Form S-1registration statement with the Commission, which they had previously prepared.DCase 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 6 of 14 It provided that Sonant planned to issue 10 million shares of securities at anoffering price of $0.30 per share, for a total offering price of $3 million.21. Sonant's Form S-1 listed three individuals as its officers anddirectors, and was purportedly signed by two of them. However, none of themserved in the positions listed for them in the Form S-1, and their signatures wereforged.22. Defendants knew or were severely reckless in not knowing that thethree individuals listed as officers as directors in the Form S-1 had not agreed toserve as such for Sonant.23. Notwithstanding these facts, the Defendants also prepared and filedan opinion letter with the Commission, in which Defendant Tracy stated that hehad ""examined the registration statement, the articles of incorporation and bylaws,the minutes of meetings of its board of directors, as well as all other documentsnecessary to render an opinion,"" and that the ""common shares being sold pursuantto the registration statement are duly authorized.""24. When one of the individuals listed in Sonant's Form S-1 registrationstatement whose signature was forged learned of its existence, he advised theCommission that he had never performed any work for Sonant, was not associatedCase 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 7 of 14 with it and had not authorized it to use his name in connection with the Form S-1.He also contacted the convicted felon, and demanded that Sonant file an amendedForm S-1 registration statement with the Commission to remove his name fromany association with the company.C. The Filing of Sonant's False Amended Registration Statement and theDefendants' Failure to Cure.25. In September 2015, the Defendants filed Sonant's false Form S-1/Aregistration statement with the Commission that they had prepared. It listed twoindividuals as its officers and directors, and was purportedly signed by one ofthem. Although the Form S-1 /A removed the name of the individual whocomplained to the convicted felon, the filing still failed to disclose the convictedfelon's association with and control of Sonant.26. When one of the individuals listed on Sonant's Form S-1/Aregistration statement learned of its existence, he advised Defendant Tracy that hehad been erroneously identified on it without his permission and had notauthorized the use of his electronic signature on it. He requested that DefendantTracy notify the Commission of these facts and amend the Form S-1/A to clarifythat he had no association with Sonant.Case 1:18-cv-01891-TCB   Document 1   Filed 05/01/18   Page 8 of 14 27. Although Defendant Tracy advised this individual that he would doas instructed, he failed to do so. Instead, on October 15, 2015, the Defendantsrequested that the Commission withdraw Sonant's registration statement.28. On October 19, 2015, the Defendants notified the Commission thatSonant was rescinding its request to withdraw its registration statement.COUNTIAiding and Abetting Violations ofSection 17(a)(1) of the Securities ActX15 U.S.C. ~ 77q(a)(1)129.

According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Adam Tracy and his law firm, Securities Compliance Group, Ltd., were retained by a convicted felon and his company, Sonant Communications Corp., to file a registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of 10 million shares of common stock. The SEC alleges, however, that the felon asked Tracy to conceal his role with the company such that his involvement would be hidden from the SEC and the investing public. As alleged in the complaint, Tracy agreed to participate in the ruse by drafting and filing with the SEC two registration statements that omitted the felon's name, and, instead, named others, without their knowledge or consent, as being the principal officers and control persons of Sonant.  The SEC's complaint charges Tracy and Securities Compliance with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. To settle the SEC's charges, the defendants agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of permanent injunctions, disgorgement of all legal fees received in connection with the scheme with prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,655.71, a civil monetary penalty of $25,000, and a penny stock bar against Tracy.

Walsh controlled and was the manager of USREDA from its inception in August 2012until April 2016, when USREDA Holdings LLC became the manager of USREDA. USREDAhandles business activities and USCIS petition work for PHH and other SARC-associatedofferings. USREDA received investor funds which were fraudulently obtained by Walsh and hisentities.-4-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 4 of 18 III.

THE EB-5 PROGRAM15. Congress created the EB-5 Program in 1990 in an effort to boost the United Stateseconomy. The EB-5 program provides a prospective immigrant the opportunity to become apermanent resident by investing in the United States.16. To qualify for an EB-5 visa, a foreign applicant must invest $500,000 or %1million (depending on the type of investment) in a commercial enterprise approved by the U.SCitizenship and immigration Service (""Immigration Service""). Once the foreign applicant hasinvested, he or she may apply for a conditional green card, which is good for two years. If theinvestment creates or preserves at least ten jobs during those two years, the foreign applicant-5-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 5 of 18 may apply to have the conditions removed from his or her green card. The applicant can thenlive and work in the United States permanently.17. A certain number of EB-5 visas are set aside for prospective immigrants whoinvest through a Regional Center, such as SARC. An applicant only has to invest $500,000 if heor she invests through a Regional Center, such as SARC.V. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDA. The Hotel18. In August 2006, Matthews purchased the Hotel through his ownership of anentity. In 2009, that entity lost the Hotel via foreclosure and Developer acquired it through hisownership of 100% of the membership interest in 160 Royal. On August 30, 2013, Developerassigned his 100% membership interest in 160 Royal to Palm House. Matthews' brother, GerryMatthews (""0. Matthews"") assumed a 99% membership interests in Palm House as nominee forMatthews, who actually controlled Palm House. Another individual, ""R.B.,"" assumed a 1%membership interest in Palm House.B. PHH's EB-5 Securities Offering19. From November 2012 until March 2015, PHH raised at least $43,991,458 ininvestor funds from at least 88 foreign investors through an EB-5 offering of PHH limitedpartnership interests. The offering materials provided to investors represented that PHH wouldloan investor funds to Palm House to acquire, develop, and operate the Hotel.20. Walsh, PHH, and SARC disseminated at least three versions of PHH's EB-5offering documents and marketing materials (collectively, ""offering materials"") to investors overthe years. Each version included a private placement memorandum (""PPM""), to which abusiness plan, loan documents between PHH and Palm House (""loan documents""), a subscriptionagreement, a limited partnership agreement, and an escrow agreement were attached. PHH-6-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 6 of 18 combined these materials into a multi-hundred page investment portfolio. The investmentportfolio also contained an ""EB-5 Investor Documents & Process Guide,"" a fee agreement, and aUSREDA/SARC Service Agreement. To streamline and expedite the closing of an investment,PHH provided a booklet which contained only the signature pages of the documents necessaryfor investors to make their investments and file their 1-526 petitions with the USCIS.21. PHH's offering materials also included various versions of a project brochure thatwas translated into Chinese and Farsi (""brochures"") and a document titled ""EB5 Petition"" thatexplained the EB-5 process. PHH's offering materials appeared under some combination ofPHH, Palm House, SARC, and USREDA's names, and the Hotel and SARC's logos.22. PHH, through Walsh and others, solicited investors through sales agents. PHHprovided the sales agents with an email that included links to its investment portfolio, thebrochure, and the ""EB5 Petition"" document. Each investor or the sales agent for the investorreceived a copy of the relevant offering documents prior to investing.23. Walsh and USREDA's in-house counsel each participated in creating PHH'soffering materials. The in-house counsel drafted PHH's PPMs, business plans, loan documentsand subscription, limited partnership, and escrow agreements with information provided byWalsh and Matthews. Walsh reviewed and approved all of these documents. Walsh also signedsome of these documents, including the ""EB5 Investor Documents & Process Guide"" aspresident and managing partner of SARC and USREDA, the fee agreement as president ofSARC, and at least one version of the USREDA/SARC Service Agreement on behalf ofUSREDA. Further, Walsh edited, reviewed, and approved various versions of the brochure and""EB5 Petition,"" and signed a letter included in the EB5 Petition as ""C.E.O./President USREDA,Inc.""-7-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 7 of 18 24. Matthews directly and indirectly provided information to Walsh and the in-housecounsel that was included in PHH's PPMs and business plans, and received and reviewed draftsof other documents included in the offering materials provided to investors, including thebrochure.25. As the control person of Palm House, Matthews directed R.B. to sign one versionof the loan documents as managing member of Palm House because Matthews did not want tosign them himself.26. Matthews also met with sales agents, investors, and prospective investors multipletimes regarding the Hotel project.C. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions to PHH Investors1. MisaDnropriation of Investor Funds bv Walsh. PHH. SARC. andMatthews27. Between November 2012 and at least December 2014, the offering materialsmisrepresented that investor funds would be loaned to Palm House to acquire, develop andoperate the Hotel. In reality, PHH, SARC, and Walsh misappropriated approximately$ 13,578,000 of investor funds. First, Walsh kept at least $8,078,000 of investor funds earmarkedfor the Hotel project. Walsh co-mingled these funds with other funds he controlled for his ownuse and to pay expenses unrelated to the Hotel project. Second, in December 2013, Walshloaned Matthews at least $5.5 million of investor funds to save Matthews' personal Palm Beach,Florida mansion from foreclosure. The loan, which was undocumented, was never disclosed toinvestors. In March 2014, Matthews sent Walsh an email expressing his ""gratitude"" for Walsh""saving [his] house.""28. Between approximately June 2014 and December 2014, Matthewsmisappropriated at least $3.4 million of investor funds to obtain title for and pay expenses-8-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 8 of 18 associated with a 151-foot yacht and a piece of property located next to the Hotel. Both weretitled in the names of entities owned and controlled by a member of Matthews' family.Matthews' use of investor funds in this manner was neither permitted by the olTering materialsnor disclosed to investors.29. Between February 2014 and June 2014, Matthews also directed the transfer ofapproximately $4.5 million of investor funds that, through a series of transactions, were used topurchase his former home in Connecticut out of foreclosure and for other related expenses.Matthews then extracted $1.2 million from the Connecticut home through a business purposeloan secured by the property, from which he and his family received $825,000.2. Misrenrcsentations Regarding Escrow RcQuiremcnts and the Returnof Investor Funds30. Between November 2012 and at least June 2014, PHH's offering materialscontained material misrepresentations regarding PHH's use of an escrow account for investorfunds. PHH falsely and fraudulently claimed that investor funds would be held in an escrowaccount at PNC Bank, pursuant to an escrow agreement between PHH, SARC, and PNC Bank,through at least the filing of the investor's 1-526 petition. Contrary to these representations, noescrow account even existed for investor funds. Prior to the PHH offering, the former CFO forSARC and USREDA informed Walsh that the account receiving investor funds would not evenbe administered by PNC Bank.31. PHH's offering materials also contained material misrepresentations regarding thereturn of funds paid by investors. PFIH's PPMs falsely and fraudulently stated that if aninvestor's 1-526 petition were denied by the USCIS for reasons ""within the control"" of PHH, theinvestor's funds would be returned without deduction. The offering materials and SARC's ownwebsite also falsely, fraudulently, and repeatedly stated that investors' funds would be returned if-9-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 9 of 18 their 1-526 petitions were denied generally or without ""cure."" For example, the brochures slatedthat ""[USREDA] and South Atlantic Regional Center offers a 100% Full Refund of all fees andinvestment if your 1-526 is not approved."" Some of these documents and SARC's websitefalsely and fraudulently referred to the promise of a return of the funds as a money back""guarantee.""32. PHH, SARC, and Walsh knew or recklessly disregarded that USREDA andSARC would not be able to repay investors whose petitions were denied because theymisappropriated for their own use millions of dollars of investor funds, and never escrowedinvestor funds prior to their release to Palm House. To date, the USCIS has denied all of theinvestor 1-526 petitions except one, for which it has issued a Notice of Intent to Deny. TheUSCIS denied the 1-526 petitions because, among other reasons, investors failed to demonstratethat the Hotel project would create sufficient jobs given the uncertainty of the project's future.PHH never returned any money to investors.3. Misrcnrcscntations and Omissions Regarding Walsh and Matthews*Backgrounds33. PHH's PPMs and business plans contained misrepresentations and omissionsregarding the backgrounds of Walsh and Matthews, who are both described in a section on""Management."" The description of Walsh's background, which he drafted, stated that he ""hasextensive experience in merger and acquisition strategy and law"" and experience with ""theintricacies of U.S. Securities and Exchange laws."" Walsh did not have any such merger andacquisition or securities law experience.34. Matthews was described as the chairman of Matthews Ventures Holdings, LLC(""MVH""), a diversified holding company with interests in, among other things, real estate,hotels, and construction. However, PHH's PPMs and business plans materially omitted that in-10-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 10 of 18 2009, one of Matthews' companies, PB Realty Holdings LLC, was placed into involuntarybankruptcy with subcontractors obtaining approximately $2 million in judgments againstMatthews, and that Matthews had lost to foreclosure both his own home, as well as the veryHotel in which investors were purportedly investing. Matthews provided his biography to the in-house counsel for inclusion in the PPMs.35. The offering materials also included a section on G. Matthews but did not disclosethat he was a nominee for Matthews in the ownership of the Hotel because of Matthews'financial problems, a material omission. Walsh knew G. Matthews was a nominee for Matthewsbecause of Matthews' financial problems.4. Other Misrepresentations to PHH investors36. PHH's offering materials also materially misrepresented the conditions underwhich investor funds would be loaned to Palm House. In particular, the PPMs stated, ""it shall bea condition of each advance that as of such time there shall not have been a material adversechange in the operations, assets or financial condition of the [bjorrower and its subsidiaries,taken as a whole."" The loan documents made similar representations and stated that thedetermination as to material adverse changes would be made by PHH. Walsh and PHHŠwhichloaned at least $30,413,462 of investor funds to Palm HouseŠnever ascertained whether PalmHouse met these pre-conditions for any loan advance.37. Matthews' misappropriation of approximately $7.9 million dollars of investorfunds represented material and adverse changes in the operations, assets, and financial conditionof Palm House, 160 Royal, and the Hotel, all of which he controlled. Despite being granted theauthority by the loan documents to access Palm House's financial statements and the right toinspect its books and records, PHH never exercised this authority.-II-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 11 of 18 38. The offering materials also materially misrepresented that PHH would provideaudited financial statements or other financial information to investors on an annual or quarterlybasis. PHH never prepared audited financial statements and did not provide audited statements,or any other fmancial reports, to investors.39. The offering materials also misrepresented that Palm House would make monthlyinterest payments to PHH on its loan for five years. Palm House did not make any monthlyinterest payments to PHH.40. In order to bolster investor confidence in PHH's securities offering, PHH'sbusiness plans and brochures also made materially misleading statements suggesting that PalmHouse had substantial funds at stake in the Hotel, and that investor funds were only part of analready well-financed development project. Based on information provided in part by Matthews,PHH's business plans falsely and fraudulently represented that Palm House had $22 million inequity in the Hotel, and the brochures fraudulently stated the project was ""very safe"" based inpart on a substantial equity investment from Palm House. In reality. Palm House acquired theHotel on August 30, 2013 through a $27,468,750 mortgage on the Hotel, with no pre-existingequity in the Hotel.D. Relief Defendants41. Matthews controlled 160 Royal and its bank accounts through his control of PalmHouse. During the course of the fraudulent scheme, PHH, Walsh, and SARC advanced millionsof dollars of investor funds to 160 Royal. During this same time period, Matthews divertedmillions of dollars of investor funds from 160 Royal to other accounts he controlled.42. Walsh controlled and was the manager of USREDA, which handled businessactivities and USCIS petition work for PHH and other SARC-associated offerings. USREDA-12-Case 9:18-cv-81038-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/03/2018   Page 12 of 18 received millions of dollars of investor funds which were fraudulently obtained by Walsh and hisentities.VI.

According to the SEC's complaint, over a period of more than two years, Joseph J. Walsh and Robert V. Matthews defrauded dozens of foreign investors participating in the EB-5 program administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which provides foreign nationals with an opportunity to qualify for permanent U.S. residency by investing in domestic, job-creating projects. According to the SEC's complaint, Walsh raised close to $44 million from foreign investors which, through a loan, was to be used to acquire, develop, and operate a Palm Beach hotel controlled by Matthews. The complaint alleges that Walsh misappropriated more than $13 million of the investor funds and that Matthews misappropriated approximately $8 million, some of which he used to acquire a 151-foot yacht and to purchase his former Connecticut home out of foreclosure. According to the SEC's complaint, Walsh and two companies he controlled - Palm House Hotel LLLP (PHH) and South Atlantic Regional Center, LLC (SARC) - also misled investors about the use of an escrow account that purportedly held investor funds prior to disbursement to the hotel, and about Walsh's and Matthews' backgrounds.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida, charges Walsh, PHH, and SARC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with interest, and penalties. The SEC's complaint also charges Matthews with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and with aiding and abetting PHH, SARC, and Walsh's violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. In addition, the SEC's complaint also charges as relief defendants 160 Royal Palm, LLC and United States Regional Economic Development Authority LLC d/b/a EB5 Petition for the sole purpose of recovering investor funds they received from Walsh and his entities or Matthews.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Shelly-Ann A. Springer-Charles, Timothy J. Galdencio, and Crystal C. Ivory and was supervised by Eric R. Busto. The SEC's litigation will be led by Alejandro Soto. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services."

(‚Cubist™) are in discussions regarding a contemplated 1               Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 2 of 10 PageID: 2 strategic transactionﬂ that ﬁis likely to be consid ered material to Cubist.ﬂ The email attachment further advised that, pursuant to Merck™s corpora te insider trading policy, ﬁ[y]ou may not purchase, sell or otherwise engage in any trading of Cubist™s stock until a full trading day has elapsed after a public announcement of the Transaction.ﬂ 2. Within approximately 14 minutes after bein g sent the email, Xie purchased 80 shares of Cubist stock in his personal brokerage account at a price of $73.39 per share. 3. On December 8, 2014, Merck publicly annou nced its intention to acquire Cubist for $102 per share in cash (39% premium to Xie™s purchase price) via a tender offer, which was completed on January 21, 2015. 4. Xie sold his Cubist stock on January 21, 2015, for a profit of approximately $2,287. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21A and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u-1 and 78aa ]. The Defendant, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the mails in connection with the conduct alleged herein. 6. Venue in this judicial district is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the acts, transacti ons, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within this judicial district in that: Xie was a resident of Bridgewater, New Jersey during the period at issue; Xie worked for Merck from an office within New Jersey during the period at issue; and Xie placed his order to buy the securities at issue via a device connected to the Internet while located in his office at Merck within New Jersey. DEFENDANT 7. Yang Xie (Xie), age 38, is a citizen of China who resided in Bridgewater, New Jersey under a U.S. work visa from approx imately December 2010 to May 2016. 2            Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 3 of 10 PageID: 3 8. During this period, and until approximately October 2016, Xie worked for a subsidiary of Merck. Xie held the title of Director of Global Health Outcomes Research at Merck™s Center for Observational and Real World Evidence, a unit within Merck™s Research & Development  division that did observational research and comparative effectiveness research to assess the value of  medical interventions relative to alter natives in ﬁreal worldﬂ settings. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES 9. Merck, a New Jersey corporation, is a globa l health care company headquartered in Kenilworth, N.J. Merck™s common stock is re gistered with the Commission and Merck files periodic reports with the Commission. Merck™s stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 10. Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cubist), until approximately January 2015, was a Delaware corporation in the pharmaceuticals ind ustry headquartered in Lexington, MA. Cubist™s stock was registered with the Commission and Cubi st filed periodic reports with the Commission. Cubist™s stock was quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On January 21, 2015, Merck  completed a successful tender offer for all the ou tstanding shares of Cubist™s stock and acquired Cubist through a merger of Merck™s wholly owned subsidiary with and into Cubist. FACTS 11. As an expert in health outcomes research, part of Xie™s job at Merck was to assess the value and cost effectiveness of drugs Merck was marketing, developing, or that Merck was considering acquiring. Xie specialized in evaluating antibacterial and antifungal drugs for treatment of certain infectious diseases. Xie often contributed his health outcomes research to colleagues at Merck who advised the company on new product launches and proposed acquisitions. 12. Prior to 2015, one of Merck™s main competitors developing infectious disease drugs was the pharmaceutical company Cubist. 3                    Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 4 of 10 PageID: 4 13. In 2014, Merck considered acquiring Cubist. To ensure confidentiality of the deliberations, Merck™s contemplated acquisition of Cubist was given the internal code name ﬁProject Pablo.ﬂ In early to mid-2014, Xie analyzed in formation that was marked ﬁconfidentialﬂ about Cubist™s products from a health outcomes perspective. 14. On July 2, 2014, the Project Pablo team ultimately concluded their review of Cubist by ﬁrecommending at this time not to pursue this acquisition.ﬂ 15. At or around September and October, 2014, Merck decided nonetheless to pursue an acquisition of Cubist. At about the same time, Merck retained legal counsel and an investment banking firm for the purpose of pursuing the acquisition of Cubist. 16. On approximately October 7, Merck™s CEO approached Cubist™s CEO to broach the idea of Merck acquiring Cubist. Confidential negotiations began shortly thereafter, and Merck changed the internal code name for the acquisition from ﬁProject Pabloﬂ to ﬁProject Diego.ﬂ 17. On approximately November 10, Merck™s CEO informed Cubist™s CEO that Merck was prepared to make a non-binding, all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding Cubist stock for $102 per share, a significant premium to the pri ce of Cubist™s stock at that time quoted on the NASDAQ. Insider Trading in Conn ection with Merck™s Tender Offer for Cubist 18. At approximately 4:04 p.m. on November 20, 2014, an attorney in Merck™s Office of General Counsel sent a group email message to a pproximately 60 Merck employees, including Xie, with the subject line ﬁPROJECT DIEGO (f/k/a PABL O).ﬂ The email included two attachments, one of which was entitled ﬁDiego No Trading Memo.ﬂ 19. The ﬁDiego No Trading Memoﬂ attachment specifically warned: Merck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ﬁCubistﬂ) are in discussions regarding a contemplated strategic transaction (the ﬁTransactionﬂ).  The Transaction is likely to be considered material to Cubist. As  such, we would like to remind you of the insider trading and 4               Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 5 of 10 PageID: 5 confidentiality obligations that apply to you with respect to the Transaction. You may not purchase, sell or otherwise engage in any trading of Cubist™s stock until a full trading day has elapsed after a public announcement of the Transaction.... Please see Merck™s Corporate  Policy #30 on Insider Trading for additional information. This matter remains extremely confidential. We ask that you continue to restrict information about the potential Cubist Transaction to only those who have an absolute need to know as Merck has certain confidentiality obligations to Cubist..... 20. The body of the email asked recipients to ﬁread the attached memorandum regarding Project Diego (f/k/a Pablo)ﬂ and to respond acknow ledging that they have read and understood the memo. The body of the email also asked the recipients to identify other people not already included on the distribution ﬁwho are aware of the deal.ﬂ 21. Xie replied to the email six minutes later, at approximately 4:10 p.m., acknowledging his receipt of the email. Xie™s reply stated in full: ﬁI am on your distribution list so I got the email, but I™m not on the list in your word document. I don™t know if should be on your list or not as this is my first time hearing about Project DIEGO. But judging from the other people on the list I might be. Can you check and let me know? Thanks!ﬂ 22. Approximately eight minutes later, at 4:18 p.m., Xie placed an order to buy 80 shares of Cubist stock. His order was filled almost immediately at a cost of $73.39 per share. 23. At approximately 7:00 a.m. on December 8, 2014, 19 days after Xie bought Cubist stock, Merck and Cubist made their first public announcements of the deal. According to the  announcement, Merck and Cubist entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck would engage in a tender offer to acquire Cubist for $1 02 per share in cash, representing a premium of $28.61 (39%) to Xie™s cost basis in Cubist stock. 24. On January 21, 2015, Merck announced the successful completion of the tender offer at a purchase price of $102. 5                   Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 6 of 10 PageID: 6 25. Xie sold his 80 shares of Cubist stock on January 21 at $101.98, for proceeds, excluding commissions, of $8,158.40. Thus, Xie realized profits of $ 2,287.20 . 26. During the Commission staff™s investigation, Xie denied learning about Merck™s proposed acquisition of Cubist until the night before it was publicly announced. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder 27. Paragraphs 1 through 26 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference. 28. As an express condition of his employment, Defendant Xie owed a fiduciary or similar duty of trust and confidence to Merck and its shareholders, including the duty to keep nonpublic information obtained in the course of his employment confidential and to not use such information for his personal benefit. 29. Xie acted at least recklessly in failing to know that the email he was sent on November 20, 2014, contained information concerni ng Merck™s tender offer to acquire Cubist that was confidential and that he was not permitted to tr ade Cubist securities until after this information was disclosed publicly. 30. By reason of the conduct described above, Defendant Yang Xie, acting at least recklessly, by use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, directly or indirectly: (a) employed devices, schemes or artifices to defraud; and/or (b) engaged in acts, practices, or courses of business which operate or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any persons, including purchases or sellers of the Cubist™s securities. SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF Violations of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 Thereunder 31. Paragraphs 1 through 30 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference. 6          Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 7 of 10 PageID: 7 32. By November 20, 2014, the date of Xie™s purc hase of Cubist securities alleged herein, substantial steps had been taken to commence Merc k™s tender offer to acquire Cubist, including: both companies hiring legal counsel and investment banking advisors, negotiations between senior officers of Merck and Cubist, and the companies reac hing a tentative agreement about the terms of a tender offer. 33. On November 20, 2014, Defendant Xie purchased the securities to be sought by the tender offer while in possession of material informat ion relating to such tender offer, which he at least had reason to know was nonpublic information, and which he at least had reason to know had been acquired from a representative acting on behalf of Merck, the offering company. 7 Case 2:18-cv-02779 Document 1 Filed 02/27/18 Page 8 of 10 PageID: 8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully request s that this Court enter a judgment: A. Permanently enjoining Defendant Xie from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] and Securities Act Section 17(a) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]; B.

Inc. employee who bought stock in a company that Merck was preparing to acquire in a tender offer agreed to pay a penalty equal to three times his illegal insider trading profits to settle an action by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 20, 2014 at 4:04 p.m., Yang Xie, then-Director of Global Health Outcomes Research for Merck, received an email from a Merck attorney discussing a contemplated merger between Merck and Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The email included an attachment advising recipients not to trade in Cubist's stock until a full trading date had elapsed after a public announcement of the acquisition. The complaint alleges that, approximately six minutes later, Xie replied to the e-mail and acknowledged receiving it. Approximately 14 minutes after he received the Merck attorney's email, Xie bought 80 shares of Cubist stock. On January 21, 2015, the date the tender offer was completed, Xie sold his Cubist stock and realized illegal profits of approximately 39%. During the SEC's investigation that followed, Xie allegedly denied learning about Merck's proposed acquisition of Cubist until the night before it was publicly announced.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges Xie with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and Exchange Act Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Xie has agreed to the entry of permanent injunctions as well as to pay disgorgement of $2,287, which represents Xie's trading profits, plus prejudgment interest and a $6,681 civil penalty of three times his trading profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The investigation was conducted in the SEC's Home Office by Adam Eisner and Keith O'Donnell and supervised by C. Joshua Felker, Stephan Schlegelmilch, and Melissa Hodgman.

Contrarian was one of a number of organizations formed pursuant to a 2015 Nevada state law that, for the first time, allowed Nevada-based entities to collect and pool money from investors anywhere in the world for purposes of sports wagering. Entities like Contrarian promoted their investment opportunities as functioning like mutual funds.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the District of Nevada, in 2015 Nevada passed a law allowing entities to solicit and collect funds from individual investors anywhere in the world, aggregate those funds, place wagers on certain sporting events, and split the wagering profits among the investors. In 2016 and 2017, Contrarian raised over $400,000 from more than 30 investors. Contrarian conducted a general solicitation by widely offering its investment opportunity on the internet and further failed to make a determination regarding whether all of its investors were accredited.  The Complaint charges Contrarian with conducting an unregistered offering of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission accepted Contrarian's offer of settlement in which, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, it consented to the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requiring it to send a copy of the final judgment to each investor.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by William S. Dixon. The case was supervised by Natalie M. Brunson and Aaron W. Lipson, with the litigation overseen by W. Shawn Murnahan and M. Graham Loomis.

During that time period, Romer worked as a registered representative associated with CoreCap Investments, Inc., a registered broker-dealer with the SEC (ﬁCoreCap Investmentsﬂ). 2. Romer persuaded at least 30 of his cu stomers to sell securities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer th e proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC (ﬁP&R Capitalﬂ) or CoreCap Solutions, LLC (ﬁCoreCap Solutionsﬂ).  Romer represented to customers that upon transferring money to P& R Capital and CoreCap Solutions, he would invest their money in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.1    Page 1 of 10  - 2 - investments.  Based on Romer™s representati ons, the customers understood that CoreCap Solutions and P&R Capital were affiliated with CoreCap Investments. 3. Romer™s statements to his customers were false.  P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no relationship to CoreCap  Investments.  Romer did not invest the cust omers™ money in the stock market for their benefit.  He instead stole the money for his own personal use.  Romer commingled approximately $2.7 million of customer funds w ith his advances from CoreCap Investments and other sources for a total of approximately $4.4 million.  Of that, Romer used  approximately $3.5 million for trading in his personal brokerage accounts, paid approximately $714,000 to cover his personal expenses, paid approximately $343,000 to customers of his prior brokerage firms, paid approximately $302,000 to customers of CoreCap Investments, and transferred appr oximately $41,000 to family members. 4. By engaging in this conduct, Romer violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.   5. In connection with this lawsuit, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Romer to enjoin him from future viol ations of the above-cited provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC furthe r seeks an order requiring Romer to pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest, of th e ill-gotten gains that he received through his fraud, along with the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t] and Section 21 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u].

The Court has jurisdiction over this ac tion pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa].  Defendant Romer, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means or instruments of transportation or co mmunication in intersta te commerce, or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 7. Venue is proper in this Court pursuan t to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa] because certain of the acts, practices and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred within the jurisdiction of the United St ates District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  In addition, during the relevant time period, Defendant Romer resided and conducted business within the Eastern District of Michigan. THE DEFENDANT 8. Ernest J. Romer, III is 57 years old and is a resident of Shelby Township, Michigan.  From October 2012 until his termination in January 2017, Romer was a registered representative associated with Co reCap Investments.  Romer held Series 7, 63 and 66 licenses.  CoreCap Investments termin ated Romer in January 2017 for engaging in undisclosed outside business activities.  In July 2017, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) barred Romer in all cap acities from association with any FINRA members.  In August of 2017, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.3    Page 3 of 10  - 4 - Affairs (ﬁLARAﬂ) revoked Romer™s securities agent registration, barring Romer from registration with a broker-dealer.   FACTS Romer™s Professional Background 9. Romer has been a registered representative associated with various broker- dealers since at least 1993.  Many of his customers followed Romer from broker-dealer to broker-dealer.  In 2012, Romer began wo rking for CoreCap Investments. Romer™s Offering Fraud and Misappropriation Scheme  10. In 2014, Romer began recommending that certain of his CoreCap Investments customers sell secu rities in their CoreCap Investments accounts and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts in the name of either P&R Capital or CoreCap Solutions.  Romer represented that he would use the f unds to make investments which would earn better returns than their current investments. Romer told some customers he would invest their funds in a variable annuity and told others he would invest in stocks or mutual funds. Based on Romer™s representations, including Ro mer™s installation of misleading signage directly behind the reception desk in the CoreCap Investme nts branch office where he worked that read ﬁCoreCap Solutions,ﬂ th e customers understood that P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were affiliated with CoreCap Investments.  11. Many of Romer™s customers were el derly retirees and unsophisticated investors.  They had most of their life sa vings invested with Romer.  Based on their decades-long relationship, the customers trusted Romer and agreed to sell securities and transfer their funds as Romer recommended. Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.4    Page 4 of 10  - 5 -  12. Based on Romer™s recommendations, from approximately 2014 to April 2016, customers sold securities in their Co reCap Investments account, transferred the proceeds to their personal bank accounts, and then wrote personal checks or provided  cashier™s checks to P&R Capital or CoreCap So lutions.  Romer deposited those checks into P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions bank accounts, over which he had sole control.  13. In April 2016, Romer began instructing customers to transfer money directly from their CoreCap Investments accounts to the P&R Capital bank account.  In those instances, Romer completed all the required pa perwork, had the customers sign it, and then sent it to CoreCap Investments™ back office for processing.    14. In total, approximately 22 cust omers sent $1,962,887 to P&R Capital and 11 customers sent $738,200 to CoreCap Solutions. Romer™s Misappropriation of Customer Funds  15. Contrary to Romer™s representati ons, P&R Capital and CoreCap Solutions were Romer™s personal businesses and had no re lationship to CoreCap Investments, and the customers™ money was not used to purch ase securities for the customers. 16. Instead, Romer used another join t checking account in his name to commingle the $2.7 million he raised from his customers with approximately $1.0 million  in advances that he received from Co reCap Investments, approximately $495,000 in cashier™s checks, and approximately $242,000 from other sources.  Romer used approximately $3.5 million for trading in his pe rsonal brokerage accounts, realizing trading losses, primarily from options trading, of about $3.1 million.  Romer also used approximately $714,000 of the commingled funds for personal expenses, including  mortgage payments, credit ca rds bills, shopping, college costs for his children, Detroit Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.5    Page 5 of 10  - 6 - Lions tickets, and cash withdrawals.  Additionally, Romer transferred approximately $41,000 to family members.  17. From the time Romer began misappropr iating his customers™ funds, he used some of their money to repay other customers at one of his former brokerage firms, who had suffered losses in a private offering in 2010 and 2011.  Eventually, Romer used  approximately $343,000 of his customers™ f unds for this fraudulent purpose.   18. Some of Romer™s CoreCap Investments customers requested that he return some of their funds.  He used funds from ot her CoreCap Investments customers to make those payments.  In total, Romer made approximately $302,000 of such Ponzi-like payments, using money he received from his victims. 19. Romer never disclosed to his CoreCap Investments customers that he would use, or had used, their funds for any of the purposes described in Paragraphs 16-18, above.   20. Romer acted deliberately, with the inte nt to deceive.  He never intended to make the investments he promised to his customers, and he never invested any of the money he raised from his customers for their benefit. 21. As a result of Romer™s false and misl eading statements, at least 30 customers transferred at least $2.7 million to Romer. Uncovering Romer™s Fraud 22. As early as mid-2015, some of Rome r™s customers began to question him about their investment returns and tax docum entation.  Romer was unable to provide the customers with any documentation relating to the investments because none of the money had been invested as promised.  Instead, Rome r told his customers various lies, including Case 2:18-cv-12927-TGB-MKM   ECF No. 1   filed 09/18/18    PageID.6    Page 6 of 10  - 7 - that their money was safe and that he was waiting for better buying opportunities or market movement before investing on their behalf. 23. Eventually, certain of Romer™s custom ers complained to the local criminal authorities.  In September 2017, Romer was charged with embezzlement by the Macomb County Prosecutor™s Office.  In July 2018, he pled no contest to those charges, and is currently awaiting sentencing.

Romer, III persuaded at least 30 of his customers, many of whom invested most of their life savings with Romer, to sell securities in their brokerage accounts and transfer the proceeds to either P&R Capital, LLC or CoreCap Solutions, LLC. Romer allegedly represented to his customers that upon transferring the money, he would invest it in the stock market and earn them a better return than their current investments.

Instead, Defendants ignored their clients™ interests and biased their inve stment advice to put money in their own pockets.The advisory clients and other investors harmed by the Defendants included reta il investors, and some of the harmed investors were senior citizens or individuals approaching retirement who invested money  from their retirement funds or pension plans into the private investments recommended by the  Defendants. 3.In connection with steering clients into four private placement investments, Temenos and Taylor breached their fiduciary duty to advisory clients and prospective clients by: failing to perform due diligence commensurate with even minimal fiduciary obligations (such as reviewing full financial information and investigating the truth of claims made by the issuers); failing to disclose known defects that came to their attention, such as:a company™s poor financial condition, que stionable spending prac tices, potential liabilities, misstatements and omissions in the compan ies™ marketing materials, and dubious claims by one company about its technology; aggressively pushing advisory clients to invest in securities in which Temenos and Taylor had undisclosed conflicts; Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 2 of 43 3recommending investments that they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, were not suitable or appropriatefo r particular investors; grosslyunderstatingsignificant risks of investing in private placementsgenerally; intentionally making numerous materially false and misleading statements and materially incomplete disclosures concerning the potential risks, returns, and value of particular private placements; failing to disclose Temenos™s own failing financial condition; giving preferential treatment to a partia l owner of Temenos (the trust for which Taylor served as trustee), by permitting it to redeem its principal investment in an illiquid investment(a privilege denied to other clients); and overcharging clients™ advisory fees by overv aluing the private placement investments, in violation of Temenos™s own written policies. 4.Temenos and Taylor also played an extensive role in soliciting the private placement investmentsin exchange for commissions from the private companies.  In doing so, they illegally acted as unregistered broker-dealers when selling those investments. 5.Through the activities alleged in this Complaint,Temenosand Taylor,while acting as investment advisers,have employed devices, schemes and artif ices to defraud their investment advisory clients and have engaged in acts, transac tions, practices and courses of businesses which operated as a fraud on their i nvestment advisory clie nts,in violation of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advi sers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvise rs Actﬂ).  Temenos violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Actand Rule 206(4)-7 thereunderby failing to implement its written valuation policy.Taylor aided and abe tted that violation.  And,Temenos Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 3 of 43 4and Taylor violated Section 15(a) of the Secu rities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) by inducing and attempting to induce the purchase and sa le of securities without being registered as a broker or dealer or being associated with a registered broker or dealer 6.The Commission seeks: a.entry of appropriate permanent in junctions, including an injunction prohibiting Defendants from further violations of the relevant provisions of  the federal securities laws; b.disgorgement of Defendants™ill-gotten gains, pluspre-judgment interest; and, c.imposition of civil penaltiesdue to the egregious nature of Defendants™ violations. JURISDICTIONAND VENUE 7.The Commission seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement pursuant to Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act [15U.S.C. §80b-9(d)]and Section21(d)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(1)].The Commission seeks the imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to Section 209(e) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. §80b-9(e)]andSection 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)]. 8.The Court has jurisdiction over this acti on pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78aa]and Sections 209(d), 209(e) and 214 of the Advisers Act [15U.S .C. §§80b-9(d), 80b-9(e), 80b-14]. 9.Venue is proper in this District because , at all relevant time s,Temenos and Taylor operated as investment advisersa nd served advisory clients in C onnecticut.  In addition, the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business constituting the alleged violations occurredin  Connecticut.Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 4 of 43 510.In connection with the co nduct described in this Complaint, Defendants directly or indirectly made use of the mails or th e means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce. 11.Defendants™conduct involved fraud, deceit, or deliberate or reckless disregard of regulatory requirements, and resulted in substantial loss, or significant risk of substantial loss, to  other persons.DEFENDANTS 12.Temenos Advisory, Inc. is a Connecticut corporation founded by Taylor with its principal place of business in Litchfield, Connectic ut and additional offices in St. Simons Island, Georgia, and Scottsdale, Arizona.  Temenos has been registered with the Commission as an  investment adviser since 1999, and is owned by George Taylor anda trust that was set up for the benefit of Taylor™s former business partner. 13.George L. Taylor ,age 62, is a resident of Litchf ield, Connecticut.  Taylor is the CEO, founder, Chief Compliance Officer, and majo rity owner of Temenos.  Taylor is also a registered representative of a broker-dealer th at is not affiliated with Temenos.Taylor is registered as aGeneral Securities Representative, aGeneral Securities Principal, an Investment  CompanyProducts/Variable Contracts Principa l, and aUniform Securities Agentwith the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency. Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 5 of 43 6STATEMENT OF FACTS A.Defendants Took Money to Recommend th e Securities of Private Placement Companies, and Did So Without Conducting Adequate Due Diligence 14.Before 2014, Temenos and Taylor had inve sted their advisory clients™ money primarily in mutual funds, exchange traded funds, variable annuities, and p ublicly traded stocks. They charged an asset management fee to their clients based on the clients™ total assets under their management. 15.Starting in 2014, Temenos and Taylor be gan actively recommending the privately offered securities of four private companies to Temenos™s clients and prospective clients.  Between 2014 and 2017, Defendants placed more than $19million in investments by their  clients and others inthese four private issuers™ securities. And they did so without ever sufficiently examining the marketing claims, financial statements, or the business activities of  those companies. 16.Critically, by steering their clients™ investments into those securities of the four private companies, Temenos and Taylor arranged to covertlycollect commissions (a percentage of the amount invested) on top of the asset manage ment fees their clients were already paying for unbiased advice.  Although their due diligence wa s inadequate, their fina ncial incentives to recommend these private securities offerings were not. 1.Temenos and Taylor Agreedto Commi ssion-Based Solicitation Agreements with Private Placement Companies 17.Defendants recommended their clients invest in the securities offerings of at least four private companies: Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 6 of 43 718.CompanyA marketedan emergency respons e communications product. Beginning on or about April 25, 2013, Company Aengaged in a private placement securities  offering. 19.Temenos and Taylorsolicite d investments in Company A.  Between February 2014 and February2017,Temenos solicited approxima tely $11.2million of investments in Company Afrom their advisory clients and othe rindividuals(certain of whom later became advisory clientsof Temenos).From Septembe r 2014 through February 2017, pursuant to a ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ agreement with Company A, Temenos solicited investments in  Company A as its ﬁfinder.ﬂ  From October 2014 through February 2017, Company A  compensated Temenos for Temenos™s role in the private placement.Temenos, at Taylor™s  direction and under his signature as CEO, ente redintoa ﬁFinder™s Engagementﬂ with Company A, effective September 1, 2014.  Under that ag reement, Temenos receive d money equal to 2.5% of each investment it brought to Company A.  On September 9, 2015, Temenos and Company A  extended that agreement and changed the comp ensation that Temenos received.  Under the extended agreement, Temenos received 5% of each investment it brought to Company A. 20.Company B purportedto be building a fiber opt ic connection between locations along the east coast of the UnitedStates.Beg inning on or about January 15, 2015, Company B engaged in a private placement securities offering. 21.Temenos and Taylor solic ited investments in Company B.  Between September 2014and March 2017, Temenos solic ited approximately $7 million of client investments in Company B. From January 2015 to August 2015, Temenos solicited investments in Company B through a solicitation arrangement with aninterm ediary.  Temenos, at Taylor™s direction and Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 7 of 43 8under his signature, entered into a ﬁNon-Ex clusive Placement Agency Agreementﬂ with Company B effective August 1, 2015.Under that agreement, Temenos received a fee equal to  5% in cash and 5% in equity(that is, an ownership stake in Company B)of each investment  brought to Company B.  From September 2015 through February 2017,Company B  compensated Temenos directly for Temenos™s role in the solicitations. 22.Company C marketed itselfduring the relevant time periodas a crowdfunding investment portal.Company C™s f ounder and president is a former registered representative of a broker-dealer.Prior to founding Company C, he owned a companythat had a solicitation agreement with CompanyB.Company Cemploys Taylor™s wife as Managing Director,  Customer Experience.  Prior to that, she served as Principal Director of Investor Strategies.  She  received stock options in Company C as part of her compensation.  For a short time, Defendant Taylor served on Company C™s investment co mmittee.  Beginning on or about March 18, 2016, Company Cengaged in a private placement securities offering. 23.Temenosand Taylor solicite d investments in Company C.  Between March 2016 and January 2017, Defendants solicited $805,000 of client investment in Company C. 24.In the meantime, shortly after Temenos and Taylor began soliciting investments in Company C from their clients, Temenos and Ta ylor began to receive undisclosed payments from Company C.  On July 6, 2016,Company C™s CEO confirmed that Temenos would receive a fee equal to 7% of each investment it br ought to Company C in cash, and 5% more in Company C equity.  On July 15, 2016, Company C offered Taylor an additional financial incentive to solicit investments, promising Ta ylor an additional 25,000 options on purchasing Company C stock once Defendants had suc cessfully solicited $500,000 of investments for Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 8 of 43 9Company C.  The email between the CEO and Ta ylor acknowledges that Temenos would have Temenos™s advisory clients invested in Compan y C,and that Taylor would also be marketing Company C to non-clients as well to people ﬁb eyond [Taylor™s] own contacts.ﬂFrom August 2016 through December 2016, Company C compensa ted Temenos for Temenos™s solicitations. In December 2016, Temenos, at Taylor™s direc tion and under his signature, entered into a ﬁFinders (sic) Agreementﬂ with Company C, re troactively effective as of February 10, 2016. Under that agreement, Temenos received money e qual to 7% of each investment itbrought to Company C. 25.Company D purported to have developed a ne w water purification technology. In or around early August 2015, approximately one month after two of the three Temenos advisory clients who invested in Company Dhad completed their investments,the owners of Company D™s parent companyfired Company D™s president, and withdrew all the money from  Company D™s checking account. 26.Temenos and Taylor solicited $225,000of c lient investments in Company D. From in or about December 2014 to in orabout July 2015, Temenos, through Taylor, solicited investments in Company D.  Taylor expected that Company D would pay Temenos a 5% finder™s fee for investments in Company D from Temenos clients. 2.Despite Their Representations, Defendants Failed to Conduct Even the Basic Due DiligenceNecessary to Determine Whether the Private Placement  Investments Were Suita ble for Its Clients 27.Throughout the relevant period, Taylor made statements to clients that misleadingly suggested that the private pla cement investments Temenos offered had been carefully vetted and selected from a large group of potential offerings based on their favorable Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 9 of 43 10risk/return potential, and were suitable for any we althy investor.  They weren™t.  Defendants did not perform adequate due diligence before recommending that advisory clients invest in the  private placement companies.  Instead, they r ecommended those investments without even the most basic information on the companies necessary to judge the risks and rewards of those  investmentsand with a reckless disregard for the truth of their st atements about those investments.28.Defendants repeatedly represented that they had performed due diligence on the private placement investments a nd that the investments were suitable for their clients.  For instance: a.In emails sent to clients and other prospective investors in December 2014, May 2015, and December 2015, Taylor wrote, ﬁWe are fortunate to see many  opportunities in the private equity space. We try to select those which are lower risk (all private equity is risky), thos e which exhibit exceptional return potential and those which are helping to ma ke our country a better place.ﬂ b.On May 7, 2015, Defendants emailed num erous advisory clients and others soliciting themfor an investment in Company B informing clients that Temenos  sees many opportunities to invest in priv ate companies and tries to select those which are lower risk, exhibit exceptiona l return potential, and help make the country a better place. c.In a December 2016 email to advisory client s and others, Taylor stressed that all of Temenos™s private issuer securities o fferings ﬁhave strong management teams and compelling business models.ﬂ Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 10 of 43 11d.In a February 2017 email to advisory c lients and others, Taylor stated, ﬁwe don™t recommend every investment that we have access too [sic]. . . we have a process of due diligence and vetting.ﬂ In making these claims about the selection of investment opportunities, Defendants failed to notify investors that, in fact, they had not indepe ndently assessed the risk or return potential of these companies.  Moreover, Defendants omitted to mention a key selection criterion for the  private companies in questionŠthe willingness of t hose companies to pay Taylor for every client dollar steered to those companies. 29.Defendants recommended advi sory clients and prospectiv e clients invest in these private companies without doing sufficient due diligence to determine the risk of those investments, the financial stability of those companies, the business prospects of the companies,  or the suitability of the investments for particular clients.  They forwarded emails from these  companies to their advisory clients and prospe ctive clients without performing even minimal due diligence, withoutadequate effort to determine th e accuracy of the representations they were sending to advisory clients, a nd with reckless disregard for the truth of those representations. For instance: a.Defendants did not review financial st atements for Company B prior to touting Company B to clients and prospective clie nts.  Defendants began placing client funds into Company B in January 2015, well before they ever saw Company B™s  financial information.Whe n, much later, in July 2015, Defendants saw full financial information about Company B, they discovered that Company B did not Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 11 of 43 12have enough money to build the fiber optic line itclaimed to be building, and was using most of its money for marketing instead. b.Defendants failed to discoverand/or disclosethat, between March 2015 and March 2016, several lawsuits were filed against Company B and that Company B lost control of a key land parcel, whic h significantly jeopardized Company B™s ability to build its fiber optic line; c.Defendants did not conduct due dilig ence on Company Cbefore recommending their clients invest.  Instead Defe ndants relied only on their uninformed, subjective opinion thatCompany C had good legal counsel and a good  compliance firm. d.Defendants™ due diligence on Company D was limited to reading the company™s business plan and sending that informati on to a couple of Defendants™ clients who were engineers.  One of those engineer clients bluntly notif ied Defendants that CompanyD™stechnology was ﬁa bunch of crap.ﬂ  Taylor also declined an  invitation from Company Dfor Taylor to visit the Company Dfacility and view  its technology. e.On June 28, 2015,Taylor emailed a prospective investor, unreservedly recommending an investment in Compan y D and asking for more investment money based onhis great results.  Without having conducted due diligence on the company, Taylor wrote that, ﬁ– by July they will be increasing the value of the  company from 10 million val[uation]to $100 mil l[ion]ﬂ and represented that the company would sell every unitthey make and become a dominant ﬁindustry Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 12 of 43 13disruptorﬂ that would be an ﬁ$8 billion business.ﬂTaylor also statedthatthe odds wereﬁ[o]ver 60% that technology will wo rk as claimedﬂ and ﬁ[i]t succeeds you will get at least 10 to 25 times your investment–.ﬂHe had no basis for either the  supposed calculation of the odds the technol ogy would work or for the expected return on investment if it did.30.Defendants also disregarded negative information contained in the financial statementsof some of the private companies, and failed to disclose this negative information to  advisory clientsor prospective clientswhen they solicited them to invest.  For instance, Defendants knew that Company Bhad been ra pidly using up its available cashand may be facing insolvency, but nevertheless recomme nded their clients invest in Company Band collected its resulting commissions. 31.Defendants failed to corroborate the claims they later made to advisory clients and others about the private placement companies. Defendantsdid notobtain sufficient information to determine the merits and suitability of the private companiesas investments they  recommended to their advisory clients and prospe ctive clients.  Nor did they corroborate the information they received from the private placement companiesin connection with their provision of investment advice.  Instead, in many cases, Defendants blindly forwarded and/or parroted informationreceivedfrom the privat eplacementcompanies.Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care, failed to conduct su fficient due diligence , failed to make an investigation that would provide them with a re asonable basis to believe their representations about the private placement companieswere tr ue and accurate, andfailed to obtain the Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 13 of 43 14information necessary to determine whether the investments were suitable for their current and prospective advisory clients. 3.Defendants Failed Adequately to Inform Clients thatThey Were Getting Paid by the RecommendedPrivate Placement Companies, On Topof the  Clients™ Advisory Fees 32.Though they were actively engaged in, and compensated for, soliciting investments in the private placement compan ies, prior to March 31, 2015, Temenos did not disclose to its advisory clients that it received compensation from the private placement  companies.Registered investment advisers are required to file with the Commission a document called the Form ADV, which is a uniform form used to register with the Commission or, in some instances, a statesecurities regula tor.  Form ADV contains a va riety of disclosures about the adviser and its advisory business that must be updated at least annually.  Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 26, 2014, ma kes no mention of private placement or private equity investments.   Beginning in March 2015, Teme nos includedagenericdisclosure in its Form ADVabout the possibility that it might receive ﬁfi nder™s feesﬂ for private equity investments. Temenos™s Form ADV Part II, dated March 31, 2015, states, ﬁ[w]e have and may receive  finder™s or consulting fees for recommending certain private placements or private equity deals.  Typically these are only done with accredited investors whom we decide these types of investments are suitable for.ﬂ  In its Form sADVPart II,datedJanuary 15, 2016and March 31, 2017,Temenos provided slightly more disclosure ,statingthat:ﬁWe may get paid a finder™s fee or consulting fee for offering these typeof [private] investments to our clients –.  Our  compensation will vary, but typically has ranged from zero to 10%.  This could include cash or  stock compensation.ﬂ Temenos™s Form ADV Part II general disclosure about the possibility of Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 14 of 43 15receiving compensation was, at be st, a half-truth, failingto alert c lients that Temenos and Taylor were pocketing commissions whenthey put clients in to particular private offerings, even while the clients were paying advisory fees.  Such general disclosures were insufficient to enable clients to make an informed decision on whether to invest in a particular security, or to retain Temenos as an adviser.  While after March 31, 2015, Temenos ha d generally disclosed that it ﬁmayﬂ receive a finder™s or consulting fee, it failed to tell clients and prospective clients that it, in fact, was routinely receiving feesfor investments in the private placement offeringsand that  the fees were many times larger than the advisory fees the clients were paying for advice.  Nor  did Temenos notify clientswhen Temenos and/or Taylor were being compensated by receiving ownership interests in the companies, and what ef fect that conflict of in terest had on Temenos™s investment advice.  33.In particular, Defendants repeatedly failed altogether to tell clients that Defendants were getting paid by the private companies at the times when Defendants were  soliciting and investing clients™ f unds in those companies™ offeri ngs.  For instance, on March 6 and 19, 2015;May 7and 23, 2015; June 23, 2016;August 2, 2016;November 25, 2016;and  December 27, 2016,Defendants sent emails to numer ous advisory clients and otherprospective investors soliciting investments in Company B.These emails did not disclose that Temenos  expected to receive as compensation from Compan y B a percentage of the amount invested, nor was this information disclosed to those w ho expressed interest in the investments. 34.The disclosures Defendants did make were incomplete and misleading.  For example, on December 10, 2014, Defendants disclosed to approximately 35 a dvisory clients that Temenos would receive as compensation 3% of the amount investedin Company B.Numerous Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 15 of 43 16additional prospective investors received only later emails, which did not contain any such disclosure. By August 1, 2015, Temenos™scomp ensation from Company Bhad increased to 5% of the amount invested, but Defenda nts did not disclose the increase, even to those who had been told about the 3% fee.Nor did Defendants later disclose this informa tion to clients who they recommended invest in Company B. 35.On August 15, 2015, Defendants emailednum erous advisory clients and others soliciting investments in Company A.This email did not disclose that Temenos expected to  receive a percentage of the amount i nvested in CompanyAfrom Company Aas compensation.On September 23, 2015;Novemb er 19, 2015; December 4, 2015; January 13, 2016; April 22, 2016; May 16, 2016;June 20, 2016; August 17, 25,and 31, 2016; September 30,  2016; October 17, 2016;November 25, 2016; December 27, 2016;and January 10, 2017, Defendants sent additional emails tonumerous Temenos advisory clients soliciting investments  in Company A.  None of these emails disclosed that Temenos expected to receive as  compensation a percentage of the amount invest ed.Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients whothey recommendedinvestin Company A. 36.On August 2, 2016;September 19, 2016;October 18, 2016;December 27, 2016; January 23, 2017;and January 26, 2017, Defendants emailed numerous advisory clients and others soliciting investments in Company C.Several of these emails attached Company C  marketing materials.  Defendants did not disclose that Temenos expected to receive as  compensation from Company C a percentage of th e amount invested in Company C.  Nor did Defendants later disclose this information to clients who were considering investing in Company Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 16 of 43 17C.  The January 23, 2017 email also disclosed th at the CEO of Company C was associated with Temenos, but inaccuratelyreferred to him as an ﬁSEC advisor.ﬂ 37.Defendants failed to disclose several other actual or pot ential conflicts of interest to clients and potential clients when recommending investments in the private offerings.  For instance: a.Defendants did not disclose to clients that both Temenos and Taylor, personally, were under financial stress and were st ruggling to meet operating expenses when they recommended that clients invest in securities for which they received, as  compensation, a commission based upon the amount invested. b.Defendants did not disclose their expect ed ownership interests in Company B or Taylor™s expected ownership interests (or, for certain clients solicited at the end of 2016,Taylor™s wife™s ownership interest sin the form of equity options)in Company Cwhenadvising their clients about Company B, Company C,or  Company C-related investments, when soliciting their clients for investment in  Company C, or when recommending their clients invest in securities offered  through Company C™s crowd-fundingplatform. c.Defendants did not disclose that Taylor had become actively involved in helping the management of Company Bas a member of Company B™s Finance  Committee,and, for a time,was part of an ﬁadvisory committeeﬂ for Company C. 38.By failing to disclose this information to advisory clients and prospective clients who were solicited to invest in these companies, while holding themselves out as investment Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 17 of 43 18advisers, Defendants intentionall y made fraudulent misrepresentati ons and material omissions to those clients and prospective clients. 4.Defendants Improperly Placed Client s in Unsuitable and Highly Risky Investments39.Defendants recommended the private placement companyinvestments to  of theirinvestor clientswho they believed to have sufficient income, regardless of whether those risky investments were right for a particular c lient.  They emailed numer ous advisory clients, recommending thatclients invest in the private companies™ securities, without concern for the clients™ personal circumstances or risk tolerance.  For example: a.In June 2016, Taylor told over 100client s by email that, ﬁ[m]utual funds and separate accounts are expensive and ineffi cient. . .ﬂ and ﬁ[w]ith our accredited investors, private equityis a key compone nt to increase potential return and to decrease overall risk.ﬂ b.On February 13, 2017, Defendants sent a ma ss email to Temenos clients stating, ﬁ[w]e believe that wealthy investor s should have some private equity investment–.ﬂ and, ﬁ[i]ncluding more a nd different types of private equity companies increases the odds that one will be successful in this asset class Œas in  all others.ﬂ  Defendants should not have been soliciting from thei r entire client base to invest in the private companies™ securitiesŠinvestments which were inherently high risk and illiquid with a long-  term and indefinite time horizon. 40.Defendants continually recommended these private placement investments to specific advisory clients and prospective clients regardless of the suitability of the investments Case 3:18-cv-01180   Document 1   Filed 07/18/18   Page 18 of 43 19for that client.  For several clients whom De fendantsconvinced to invest in those private placementofferings, those investmentswere wholly unsuitable when considering the clients™  inability to tolerate the risk of losing money on the private placement investments and when  considering the time by which the clients would need to liquidate their investments to use the  invested funds.  For instance, Defendants placed two-thirds of one partic ularclient™s retirement funds into private placement investments.  This client, a52-year-old womanwith arisk averse investment approach,had transferred to Teme nos all of her retiremen t funds(approximately $350,000), which had previously been invested in a diverse portfolio ofmutual funds and publicly traded common stock.  Defendants advised her to sell most of those investments in order to invest in three of the private placementinvestments.  Taylor told the client that the  investments would earn her a higher rate of return for the fiftee n years she plannedto continue working.  The client knew the companies she ha d invested in were not yet publiclytraded, but did not understandthe risks associated with inve sting in private placements.  Defendantsdid not explain to her thatthese private placements we","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut investment advisory firm and its chief executive officer with putting $19 million of investor money, including elderly investors' retirement savings and pension plans, in risky investments and secretly pocketing hefty commissions from those investments.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Temenos Advisory, Inc. and George L. Taylor steered advisory clients and other investors, including senior citizens and individuals approaching retirement, into four risky, illiquid private offerings. While Temenos and Taylor charged advisory fees for unbiased financial advice, they allegedly concealed from their clients the high commissions they were pocketing from these risky and unsuitable investment recommendations, including cash and ownership stakes in the private companies they recommended, and fraudulently misled clients about the risks and prospects of the investments. The SEC also alleges that Temenos and Taylor grossly overbilled some of their advisory clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Connecticut, charges Temenos and Taylor with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.  The case is being handled by Dawn Edick, Marc Jones, Rua Kelly, Patrick Noone, and Amy Gwiazda. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Maria Viana, Kenneth Leung, and Mayeti Gametchu of the Boston office."

Case No. 2:18-cv-00131 COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) alleges: JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e), and 78aa.   2. Defendants have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 1 of 11  COMPLAINT 2   12                         28securities exchange, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. 3. Venue is proper in this district pursu ant Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this district and because defendant Alan Shinderman (ﬁShindermanﬂ) resides in this district and defendant Quicksilver Stock Transfer, LLC (ﬁQuicksilverﬂ) is headquartered in this district. SUMMARY 4. This matter involves fraud by Quicksilver, an SEC-registered transfer agent, and Shinderman, its principal and so le owner.  Quicksilver and Shinderman misappropriated funds provided by an issuer-c lient of Quicksilver that were supposed to go to shareholders.  In addition, Quicksilver also untimely filed an independent accountant™s report with the SEC. 5. In August of 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1,450,000 for the benefit of China Energy Corporation (ﬁChina Energyﬂ), one of Quicksilver™s issuer-clients.  The funds were to be transferred to Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (ﬁDTCCﬂ) to be disbursed to certain of China Energy™s shareholders who participated in a reverse stock split and going private transaction by China Energy.   6. Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of the funds received for the benefit of China Energy and its shareholders for his own benefit.  Of the misappropriated funds, Shinderman used $500,000 without authorization to make an investment for the benefit of Quicksilver on August 23, 2013.  The investment was a short-term loan to a Nevada real estate investment company that was to repay Quicksilver with a 5% return in four days. 7. The borrower on the short-term loan, however, did not repay the principal or pay the interest on time.  Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 2 of 11  COMPLAINT 3   12                         28failed to forward China Energy™s funds (other than approximately $35,000 out of the $1,450,000) to DTCC when requested.  Despite repeated requests from China Energy and DTCC to pay the full amount to DTCC for the benefit of China Energy™s  shareholders, Quicksilver and Shinderman only made a series of partial payments over six weeks. 8. After threatening to sue the real es tate investment company to recover the loan principal, Quicksilver and Shin derman finally recovered the $500,000 from the real estate investment company on October 23, 2013.  Shinderman caused Quicksilver to forward $500,000 to DTCC that same day.  Quicksilver made the final payment of the misappropriated f unds to DTCC on November 6, 2013. 9. By misappropriating client funds for their own benefit, Quicksilver and Shinderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  10. In addition, Quicksilver violated, and Shinderman aided and abetted Quicksilver™s violations of, Section 17A(d )(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17Ad-12 thereunder, which require transfer agents that have possession or custody of funds related to its transfer agent activities to assure that all such funds are protected against misuse. 11. Quicksilver also violated, and Shinderman aided and abetted Quicksilver™s violations of, Rule 17Ad- 13 under the Exchange Act, which requires transfer agents to file annually with the SEC an independent accountant™s report concerning the transfer agent™s system of internal accounting controls and related procedures for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds.  Quicksilver™s report for the year ended December 31, 2013 was required to be filed by March 31, 2014, but was not filed until January 13, 2015. 12. With this action, the SEC seeks perm anent injunctions and civil penalties against Quicksilver and Shinderman. Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 3 of 11  COMPLAINT 4   12                         28THE DEFENDANTS 13. Quicksilver Stock Transfer, LLC is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Quicksilver has been registered with the SEC as a transfer agent since August 8, 2007.   14. Alan Shinderman resides in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Shinderman has been the president and sole owner of Quicksilver since September 2008. THE ALLEGATIONS A. Background 15. China Energy is a China-based Nevada corporation that produces, processes, and sells raw coal products in the People™s Republic of China.  The company was founded in 2000 a nd is based in Hohhot, People™s Republic of China. China Energy was incorporated in Nevada on October 11, 2002.  China Energy™s corporate status went into default in October 2015, and the current status is listed as revoked.   16. Quicksilver served as the transfer agent for China Energy in 2013. Among the services that Quicksilver had agreed to provide China Energy were issuing stock certificates and warrants, disbursing dividends, and holding all unpaid and undisbursed funds unless instructed otherwise by China Energy. 17. In September 2013, China Energy effected a reverse stock split as part of a going private transaction. 18. DTCC was responsible for the admi nistration of funding for China Energy™s stock redemption in connecti on with the reverse stock split.   19. In connection with the reverse stock split, Quicksilver was to pay DTCC for shareholders who tendered their shares for redemption as part of the going private transaction.  To fund those payments, China Energy had wired a total of $1,450,000 to Quicksilver™s bank account through three wire transfers between August 5 and August 15, 2013.  As part of the reverse stock split and redemption process, China Energy instructed Quicksilver to forward the funds that Quicksilver was holding for Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 4 of 11  COMPLAINT 5   12                         28China Energy™s benefit to DTCC to effect the redemptions. 20. Shinderman had sole signatory authority over Quicksilver™s bank account.  Quicksilver™s bank account had a balance of only approximately $1,000 prior to receiving the first wire transfer of $50,000 from China Energy on August 5, 2013. 21. On August 5, 2013, DTCC sent its first instruction to Quicksilver for a payment of $34,568.80.  Two days later, Quicksilver received authorization from China Energy to make that payment to DT CC, and two days after that, on August 9, Quicksilver made the requested paym ent to DTCC by wire transfer. 22. On August 9, 2013, DTCC sent a second instruction for payment in the amount of $17,381.56.  After subseque nt discussions between DTCC and Quicksilver, Quicksilver represented to DTCC that it would remit the entire balance to DTCC once the reverse split was fully effective.   B. Misappropriation of China Energy™s Funds 23. Quicksilver did not maintain in its bank account the balance of the funds it had received from China Energy for th e benefit of China Energy and its shareholders.  Rather, Quicksilver and Shinderman, without authorization by China Energy, diverted over $630,000 for their own uses, including $500,000 to an investment for the benefit of Quicksilver. 24. On August 23, Shinderman caused Qu icksilver to make a $500,000 loan to First 100, LLC (ﬁFirst 100ﬂ), a Nevada real estate investment company, memorialized by a promissory note for the benefit of Quicksilver.  China Energy did not authorize the use of its funds for the loan to First 100. 25. The terms of the loan provided that Quicksilver was to be repaid the entire amount of the principal along with $25,00 0, a 5% return, after four days.  First 100, however, failed to repay the loan on time.  26. In addition to the misappropriation of $500,000 for the unauthorized investment with First 100, Shinderman also caused Quicksilver to make improper Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 5 of 11  COMPLAINT 6   12                         28payments to other entities and individuals with China Energy funds from Quicksilver™s bank account, without authorization from China Energy.  Those unauthorized payments included: (a) a paym ent of $51,000 to an entity unrelated to China Energy on August 5, 2013, the same da y that Quicksilver received the initial wire transfer of $50,000 from China Ener gy; (b) payments totaling $33,222.14 to another entity unrelated to China Energy Corporation in August and September 2013; (c) $10,350 to Shinderman™s landlord on August 26, 2013; and (d) other payments and withdrawals by Shinderman unrelated to China Energy totaling over $36,900 in August and September 2013. 27. By August 30, 2013, Quicksilver™s bank account that had received the $1,450,000 wire from China Energy to effect its stock redemptions had a balance of only $819,563.11. 28. China Energy™s reverse stock split became effective on September 18, 2013.  On that same date, DTCC sent instructions to Quicksilver to make a final payment to DTCC in the amount of $1 ,247,465.38, which included the $17,381.56 payment Quicksilver had previously not remitted. 29. Because it had diverted substantial amounts of China Energy™s funds to make the loan to First 100 and for other improper and undisclosed purposes, Quicksilver and Shinderman did not have funds available to make the required payment to DTCC.  Therefore, instead of immediately paying the required funds to DTCC on behalf of China Energy, Quicksilver made a series of partial payments to DTCC over the course of six weeks.  Quicksilver paid $500,000 on October 2, and $220,500 on October 4, 2013.   30. Shinderman made a series of mi srepresentations in responding to multiple inquiries from China Energy and DT CC regarding the reasons for the delay in returning China Energy™s funds.  For ex ample, on October 21, 2013, Shinderman falsely represented to DTCC that he was encountering difficulties with his bank in getting a wire to DTCC to go through, when in fact he did not have sufficient funds in Case 2:18-cv-00131   Document 1   Filed 01/24/18   Page 6 of 11  COMPLAINT 7   12                         28his account to make the payment  becaus e he had not yet recouped the $500,000 from First 100. 31. After First 100 failed to pay the principal or interest on the loan, Quicksilver threatened to sue First 100 to recover the amounts due .  Quicksilver and First 100 entered into a settlement agreement whereby First 100 paid Quicksilver the $500,000 principal back, without interest, on October 23, 2013. 32. On October 23, 2013, upon recovering the $500,000 loan principal from First 100, Quicksilver paid $500,000 to DTCC.  Quicksilver paid the outstanding balance of $26,902.38 to DTCC on November 6, 2013. C. Failure to File Time ly Accountant™s Report 33. Rule 17Ad-13 of the Exchange Act requires all transfer agents to file annually with the SEC an independent accountant™s report concerning the transfer agent™s system of internal accounting contro l and related procedures for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds. 34. Quicksilver untimely filed an inde pendent accountant™s report required by Rule 17Ad-13 with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 31, 2013.  The accountant™s report was required to be filed by March 31, 2014, but was not filed until January 13, 2015.  As the principal of Quicksilver, Shinderman was responsible for the untimely filing of the accountant™s report.

The SEC alleged that, in August 2013, Quicksilver received wire transfers totaling $1.45 million for the benefit of China Energy Corporation. The funds were destined for certain of China Energy's shareholders by way of Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The complaint alleges that Shinderman diverted approximately $630,000 of this money for his and Quicksilver's own use and benefit, including $500,000 to make a four-day loan to a Nevada real estate company.  According to the complaint, the borrower failed to repay the principal or interest as planned. Consequently, Quicksilver and Shinderman did not timely forward China Energy's funds to DTCC, despite repeated requests. Quicksilver and Shinderman also made a series of misrepresentations in response China Energy's and DTCC's requests for the funds.  Quicksilver ultimately paid DTCC approximately six weeks later, after recovering the loan principal from the real estate company. The complaint also alleges that Quicksilver untimely filed an independent accountant's report with the SEC on January 13, 2015, for the period ending December 31, 2013.  The SEC's complaint charges Quicksilver with violations of Sections 10(b) and 17A(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 17Ad-12 and 17Ad-13 thereunder and Shinderman with violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and for aiding and abetting Quicksilver's violations of Section 17A(d) and Rules 17Ad-12 and 17Ad-13. The SEC complaint seeks permanent injunctions and the imposition of civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Melissia A. Buckhalter-Honore of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Spencer E. Bendell. David J. VanHavermaat will lead the SEC's litigation."

Themisrepresentations about the silver trading program relate to, among others, the amount of silverhe maintains in safekeeping for investors at Brink's Global Services USA (""Brink's""); his silvertrading methods; his past performance; the use of investor funds; and the safety of theinvestment.4. In fact, Rust does not maintain any amount of silver in storage with Brink's; is notemploying the sophisticated silver trading strategies he advertises to investors; is not achievingthe returns he is representing to investors; and is putting investor funds at risk by spending themon his personal businesses and on himself and his family members.JURISDICTION AND VENUE5.

Defendants, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to engagein the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein and in transactions,acts, practices, and courses of business of similar purport and object.9.

Gaylen Dean Rust, 59 (""Rust""), is a resident of Layton, Utah. He is the presidentand sole director of RRC, and also controls a number of other businesses. Rust operates theRRC retail store in downtown Salt Lake City.11. Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (""RRC""), is a Utah corporation with its principal office inSalt Lake City, Utah. It was founded in 1966 by Rust's father and is operated by Rust. RRC'sretail store and website sells rare coins, collectible paper money and precious metal bullion. Thestore specializes in early Mormon currency. Its manager is Rust's son Joshua.STATEMENT OF FACTSBackground Šthe silver trading program12. In addition to managing the retail coin business of RRC, Rust solicits investors toplace their funds into a purported investment that is based on the purchase and sale of silverbullion (the ""silver trading program""). Rust tells investors that he trades only physical silver,rather than silver futures.13. The silver trading program is managed and controlled solely by Rust.3 14. Rust represents that he uses 100% of investor funds to buy silver. Rust tellsinvestors that he stores all the silver bullion that he has purchased with investor funds at Brink'sGlobal Services USA (""Brink's"") in either Salt Lake City or Los Angeles, with 85% of investorsilver being stored in Salt Lake City.15. Rust tells investors that he trades with only half the amount of silver he hasbought for the investor, storing the other half in safekeeping.16. In the fall of 2018, Rust told investors he was storing almost $80 million of silverat Brink's.17. Rust represents to investors that he conducts all of the silver trades for theprogram through an account in the name of RRC at HSBC Bank Plc (""HSBC""). He states thathe trades using an algorithm generated by HSBC that enables him to sell at the point when theprice of silver begins to fall and to buy the silver back just before the price recovers.18. Rust represents that he uses the profit he has generated in his trades to repurchasea larger amount of silver at the lower price, thereby continually increasing the amount of silverhe holds for the investor.19. Rust represents to investors that by using the HSBC algorithm he has neverexperienced a losing month, much less a losing year. He told one prospective investor that in hisworst year he had still earned 12% a year for his investors, and that he averaged returns of 20 to25% a year.20. Rust told one prospective investor that the only risk of an investment in the silvertrading program was that the price of silver would ""go to zero.""21. Rust tells investors that he does not charge a management fee, but compensateshimself by keeping partial shares of silver left over from the trades.L! 22. Rust reassures investors that they can withdraw their funds at any time onapproximately two weeks' notice.23. Prospective investors in the silver trading program do not receive any kind ofoffering materials.24. Rust provides account statements to investors. The statements consist only of aspreadsheet showing the purported transactions over a given month. They report the profitspurportedly generated from Rust's trades during the month, the total ounces of silver owned by agiven investor at month's end, and the total value of the investor's holdings based on the price ofsilver at the time.25. The spreadsheet included in the account statement is prepared by Rust in a basicExcel format. Some of the statements were printed on the letterhead of RRC.26. Rust has been soliciting investors for the silver trading program since at leastJanuary 2017, and the solicitation is ongoing.27. Currently, there are approximately 300 investors in many states across thecountry.28. From January 2017 through August 2018, Rust raised approximately $85.7million from investors in the silver trading program.Uses of investor funds.29. From January 1, 2017 through August 2018, Rust processed funds invested in thesilver trading program through two accounts at Zions Bank. He used the first account ending in7496 (the ""investor account""), for almost all investor deposits and payments back to investors.He used another account, ending in 3564 (the ""Rust coin account""), primarily for activity related5 to his coin business, but also to some extent for investor transactions. Funds are heavilycommingled among these accounts because Rust transferred funds to and from them frequently.MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONSRust and RRC did not store investor silver at Brink's.30. In the fall of 2018, Rust told investors he was storing $80 million of investorsilver at Brink's. Brink's, however, has not held any silver for Rust or any of his entities sincelate 2016.Rust and RRC do not have an account at HSBC, and do not use its algorithm to tradesilver.31. Rust represents to investors that he pools investor funds in an account held byRRC at HSBC and that he trades silver using an algorithm developed by HSBC. He representedto investors that, thanks to this algorithm, he has never had a losing month trading silver. HSBC,however, has stated that it has never maintained an account in the name of Rust or RRC.Investor funds were not used to buy silver in the trading program.32. Rust represents to investors that he uses all investor funds to buy silver to beplaced in the silver trading program. In fact, Rust is diverting most of the investor funds hereceives to his other entities, to personal uses, and to make payments to other investors. FromJanuary 1, 2017 through August 2018 Rust took in approximately $85.7 million from investors.Of this, approximatelya. $70,243,523 was paid out in checks and wires in payments to earlier investors inthe silver trading program;b. $2,667,700 was withdrawn in cash;c. $1,162,000 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Racing, which Rust uses forhis horse racing business;d. $9,165,969 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Entertainment and itssubsidiaries and used for payroll, vendors, equipment and other expenses relatedto Rust's music and production studio; ande. $2,039,994 was transferred to Rust's entity R Legacy Investment.C1 33. These uses account for approximately 99% of the investor deposits into thisaccount.34. Investors were not told that their funds would be used for purposes other than toinvest in the silver trading program.Average returns from the silver trading program, if any, were far less than 20% to 25%.35. Rust represents to investors that his average trading returns for the program are20% to 25% a year or, as he told one investor, 40% a year. He also told an investor that hisworst trading month had still achieved a return of 3%; and that his best trading month hadachieved a return of 21 %.36. Very little silver trading, if any, is taking place in either the investor account orRust coin account at Zions Bank. Evidence suggests the only likely silver-trading expendituresout of the investor account total less than $100,000, involving transactions with precious metaland coin brokers. The Rust coin account expenditures are typical of the retail coin business atRRC, not of a silver trading program.The investor account statements provided by Rust are false.37. The account statements that Rust creates and provides to investors contain falsestatements. They show that Rust engages in various silver trades on behalf of each investorevery month, resulting in a monthly increase in the number of ounces owned by each investor.They also show that the investor owns many ounces of physical silver. In fact, Rust does nottrade silver through HSBC as he represents, nor does he store investor silver at Brink's.Materiality of Misrepresentations38. Rust's misrepresentations to investors and potential investors are material becauseinvestors would certainly find it important to know that Rust does not maintain a trading account7 at HSBC for investors; does not store quantities of investor silver at Brink's; is conducting littleif any silver trading; and is using investor funds for a variety of undisclosed purposes, includingfunding his related entities and paying returns to earlier investors.Scienter of Rust39. Rust knew his representations were false and misleading at the time he made thembecause he has at all times been in possession of the true facts, namely, that he is not storinginvestor silver bullion at Brink's; that he does not have a trading account at HSBC; that he is notusing an HSBC algorithm to trade; that he is carrying out little or no silver trading at all; that heis preparing and transmitting false account statements to investors; and that he is using investorfunds not for silver trading but to make payments to his related entities and to prior investors.The Investments in the Silver Trading Program Are Securities Being Sold in UnregisteredTransactions.40. The purchase of an interest in the silver trading program involves an investmentof money.41. Investor funds are aggregated together in the investor account and, to a lesserextent, in the Rust coin account.42. Payment of the purported investor returns is entirely dependent on Rust'sexecution of the trades in silver bullion. Investors have no role in the silver trading.43. Rust sold millions of dollars of investments in the silver trading program in anunregistered continuous offering to dozens of investors across the United States.44. Rust provided no offering materials to prospective investors.45. Rust never took any steps to determine whether a prospective investor wasaccredited. He never asked investors questions concerning their income or net worth. 46. The investments in the silver trading program were offered and sold to personswho were not accredited within the meaning of the federal securities laws.CLAIMS FOR RELIEFFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEFEMPLOYMENT OF A DEVICE, SCHEME OR ARTIFICE TO DEFRAUDViolation of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1)]47.

WhippleAmy J. OliverAlison J. OkinakaLaurie E. AbbottAttorneys for PlaintiffSecurities and Exchange Commission12","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Utah-based company and its principal in an ongoing investment scheme that has defrauded hundreds of investors in several states.  The SEC alleges that Gaylen D. Rust and his company Rust Rare Coin, Inc. (RRC) are engaged in an ongoing investment scheme involving a purported silver trading program. Through this scheme, Rust and RRC have allegedly raised over $85 million since January 2017. According to the SEC, Rust told investors that he has access to a trading algorithm that enables him to capitalize on fluctuations in the price of silver bullion and thereby make profitable trades, regardless of the actual price of silver. He also told investors that he stores millions of tons of physical silver on behalf of investors at Brink's Global Services U.S.A. Inc. Rust claimed that his silver trading program results in average annual returns of 20% to 25%, with some years experiencing significantly higher returns. Rust also told investors that his silver trading program has almost no risk. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Rust has been using new investor funds to make payments to earlier investors and to pay for his personal expenses and the business expenses of other entities he controls.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, charges Rust and RRC with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Under the direction of Regional Director Daniel Wadley, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Alison Okinaka, Scott Frost, and Laurie Abbott, and litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver. The SEC wishes to thank the Utah Division of Securities, the Utah Attorney General's Office, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter."

( )ECF CaseIRCOMPLAINTIZARRY, CH..LEVY, M.J.Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission""), for its complaintagainst Defendants PlexCorps (a/k/a and d/b/a/ PlexCoin and Sidepay.Ca) (""PlexCorps""),Dominic Lacroix (""Lacroix""), and Sabrina Paradis-Royer (""Paradis-Royer"") (collectively""Defendants"") alleges as follows:SUMMARY1. This is an emergency action to stop Lacroix, a recidivist securities law violator inCanada, and his partner Paradis-Royer, from further misappropriating investor funds illegallyraised through the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of securities called ""PlexCoin"" orCase 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 1 of 35 PageID #: 1 ""PlexCoin Tokens"" in a putported ""Initial Coin Offering."" From August 2017 through thepresent, Defendants have obtained investor fundsŠ purportedly $15 million from thousands ofinvestors, including those throughout the United States and in this DistrictŠthrough materiallyfalse and misleading statements made by Lacroix individually and through entities Lacroixcontrols, including by promising investors returns of 1,354% in under 29 days. Lacroix andParadis-Royer misappropriated investor funds and engaged in other deceptive acts relating toinvestments in the PlexCoin Token, despite having both been enjoined by a Quebec tribunalfrom engaging in the very conduct that is the subject of this action.2. The ICO for the PlexCoin Tokens was an illegal offering of securities becausethere was no registration statement filed or in effect during its offer and sale, and no applicableexemption from registration. The PlexCoin ICO was a general solicitation made usingstatements posted on the Internet and distributed throughout the world, including in the UnitedStates, and the securities were offered to the general public and have been sold to a large numberof investors, including many in the United States and in this District.3. The stated purpose of the PlexCoin ICO was to obtain ""tokenized currency"" sothat investors could ""Take control of [THEIR] money!"" Investors in the PlexCoin ICO werepromised returns stemming from: (i) the appreciation in value of the PlexCoin Token throughinvestments PlexCorps would make with the proceeds of the PlexCoin ICO and based on themanagerial efforts of PlexCorps' team of supposed experts; (ii) the distribution to investors ofprofits from the PlexCorps enterprise; and (iii) the appreciation in value of the PlexCoin Tokensbased on efforts of PlexCorps' ""market maintenance"" team, which included listing the token ondigital asset exchanges. The PlexCoin Token currently trades under the symbol PXN.Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 2 of 35 PageID #: 2 4. Lacroix and PlexCorps enticed potential investors to purchase PlexCoin Tokensearly on during the ICO, with promises that if all 400 million PlexCoin Tokens for sale weresold, the early investors would reap outlandish rewards of 1,354% in 29 days or less (thesupposed period of the PlexCoin ICO), and by comparing the supposed returns to those in otherICOs or investments in cryptocurrenciesŠreturns as high as 88,000%.5. In connection with the PlexCoin ICO, PlexCorps and Lacroix made the followingfalse and misleading statements, among others, for which Lacroix was responsible: (a) that thePlexCorps' ""team"" consisted of a growing cadre of experts stationed around the world and with aprincipal place of business in Singapore; (b) that the identity of PlexCorps' executives had to bekept hidden to avoid poaching by competitors and for privacy concerns; (c) that the proceeds ofthe PlexCoin ICO would be used to develop other PlexCorps products; and (d) that investorscould expect ""enormous"" and ""real"" returns on PlexCoin Token investments.6. Contrary to these false representations, and as Lacroix knew or recklesslydisregarded, PlexCorps and the PlexCoin Token are a scam because: (a) there is no PlexCorpsteam, other than a handful of Lacroix's employees in Quebec working on the project, and nogroup of experts working across the globe; (b) the reason that PlexCorps did not disclose theidentity of its principal executiveŠLacroixŠwas because Lacroix was a known recidivistsecurities law violator in Canada; (c) the proceeds from the PlexCoin ICO were not destined forbusiness development but instead were intended to fund Lacroix and Paradis-Royer's expensesincluding home decor projects; and (d) there was no reasonable basis to project returns oninvestment in Defendants' scam.7. Lacroix and PlexCorps made and/or controlled the dissemination of the foregoingmisstatements and omissions in various postings on the Internet and on social media, includingCase 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 3 of 35 PageID #: 3 in a ""whitepaper"" issued by PlexCorps in connection with the offer and sale of securities duringthe PlexCoin ICO, and on webpages and Facebook accounts registered in their name, all ofwhich were accessible to United States investors via the Internet during the relevant periods.8. The funds fraudulently raised during the PlexCoin ICO have been channeledthrough various fiat currency accounts belonging to Defendants as well through cryptocurrencyaddresses under Defendants' control on various ""blockchains."" The fiat currency accountsinclude online payment services accounts in the United States that Defendants opened (directlyor indirectly) in the name of PlexCorps or its business alter egos, PlexCoin and Sidepay.Ca.Paradis-Royer herself opened and directed the disbursement of funds from some of theseaccounts, fully aware of or recklessly disregarding the dealings of her partner Lacroix.9. To skirt the registration requirements of the federal securities laws, Lacroix hasattempted to refashion the PlexCoin Tokens as a ""cryptocurrency"" and likened them to Bitcoin.In reality, PlexCoin Tokens are securities within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.10. The illegal PlexCoin ICO has occurred despite Lacroix being the subject ofprevious orders by the Quebec Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal (the ""QuebecTribunal"") enjoining him from future violations of the Quebec Securities Act, and despite havingpled guilty before a Quebec court of securities fraud.11. The foregoing illegal offering also occurred despite the Quebec Tribunal issuingan injunction in July of 2017 specifically directing Lacroix, PlexCorps, and certain companiesunder Lacroix's control, from engaging in the unregistered offering of PlexCoin Tokens, anddespite that same tribunal similarly enjoining Defendant Paradis-Royer on September 21, 2017.12. Rather than abide by the orders of the Quebec Tribunal and a contempt orderentered against Lacroix in the Quebec Superior Court, Defendants have been openly floutingCase 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 4 of 35 PageID #: 4 those orders and continue to sell and tout purchases of PlexCoin Tokens. At most, a Facebookpage related to PlexCorps indirectly acknowledged the Quebec Tribunal's injunctions, obtainedby Quebec's Autorite Des Marches Financiers (Financial Markets Authority or ""QAMF""), byoffering for sale a t-shirt with a picture of a man making an offensive gesture at the name andlogo of the QAMF.13. Throughout the relevant period, tens of thousands of investors, including over1,500 transactions with investors in the United States and many in this District, have purchasedapproximately 81 million PlexCoin Tokens for approximately $15,000,000. Of those amounts,approximately $810,000 is currently held in three accounts to which Lacroix and his associateswill soon gain access. Defendants have misappropriated or attempted to misappropriate at least$200,000 of these amounts on extravagant personal expenditures. Other amounts are believed tocurrently reside on Bitcoin or other blockchain addresses or wallets that Defendants control.VIOLATIONS14.

An ICQ is a fundraising event in which an entity offers participants a unique""coin"" or ""token"" in exchange for consideration (often in the form of crypto or fiat currency).28. The tokens are issued on a ""blockchain"" or cryptographically secured ledger.'29. Generally, coins or tokens may entitle holders to certain rights related to a ventureunderlying the ICQ, such as rights to profits, shares of assets, rights to use certain servicesprovided by the issuer, and/or voting rights. These coins or tokens may also be listed on onlineplatforms, often called virtual currency exchanges, and tradable for crypto or fiat currency.Often, the coins or tokens are immediately tradable.30. ICOs are typically announced and promoted through public online channels.Issuers usually release a ""whitepaper"" describing the project and the terms of the ICQ. Toparticipate, investors are generally required to transfer funds to the issuer's address, onlinewallet, payment processor, or other account. After the completion of the ICG, the issuer willdistribute its unique coin or token to the participants' unique address on the blockchain.' A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across anetwork, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions,including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in achain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. Ablockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Bitcoinblockchain is an example of a ""non-permissioned,"" or public and open accessblockchain. Anyone can download the Bitcoin open-source software and join. All participantsshare a single view of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is updated when Bitcoin networkparticipants reach a consensus on the validity of transactions under review. ""Permissioned"" orprivate blockchains are modifications to that model and require permissioned servers to beapproved to participate on the network or to access particular information on theblockchain. Blockchains or distributed ledgers can also record what are called smart contracts,which essentially are computer programs designed to execute the terms of a contract whencertain triggering conditions are met.Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 9 of 35 PageID #: 9 31. In some instances, the coins or tokens may continue to be sold by the originalissuer after the ICO has completed. In others, they may only be obtained by purchasing them onsecondary markets.FACTSLacroix's History as a Recidivist Securities Law Violator in Canada32. Since at least 2011, Lacroix has been the subject of several Canadian courtproceedings involving the fraudulent raising of investor funds.33. In 2011, the QAMF charged Lacroix and a company he controlled called Micro-Prets, Inc. (or ""Small-Loans"" in French) (""Micro-Frets""), with offering unregistered investmentsin Micro-Frets, purportedly in the loan business. On July 15, 2011, a division of the QuebecTribunal issued an ex parte order enjoining Lacroix and Micro-Frets from further violations. SeeAutorite Des Marches Financiers v. Micro-Frets, Inc.. 2011 QCBDR 60 (QC 2011). On August10,2011, the Quebec Tribunal rejected in all relevant parts Lacroix's request that the injunctionentered on July 15, 2011, be lifted. S^ Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Micro-Frets, Inc.,2011 QBCDR 70 (QC 2011).34. On November 2, 2011, Lacroix and Micro-Frets signed an undertakingrepresenting to the Quebec Tribunal and to the QAMF that they would not conduct anyadditional securities transactions, including through transactions through the Internet.35. On February 28, 2013, Lacroix and Micro-Frets pled guilty before a Quebectribunal to three counts each, including making materially false statements in connection with theoffer and sale of, securities, and were ordered to pay over $25,000 Canadian Dollars in criminalpenalties, arising out of the same scheme as the 2011 proceedings.10Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 10 of 35 PageID #: 10 36. Despite his 2011 undertaking and 2013 guilty plea and conviction, Lacroix ranafoul of the Quebec Securities Act at least once more earlier this year. On June 13, 2017, theQuebec Tribunal issued another order against Lacroix, DL Innov, Gestio, and Micro-Prets,having found sufficient evidence that Lacroix and those entities had raised over $2 million USDfrom over thirty investors to whom they had promised high returns if they invested in Micro-Frets' lending business, and again enjoining them from additional securities-related transactions.See Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Lacroix, 2017 QCTMF 63 (QC 2017).Defendants Begin Marketing the PlexCoin ICQ37. Undeterred by the foregoing actions, Lacroix launched his latest scam, thePlexCoin ICO, starting at least as early as June of 2017.38. In mid to late June of 2017, on a Facebook page for PlexCoin with the Facebookaddress @plexcoin (the ""PlexCoin Facebook Page""), Lacroix and PlexCorps announced thePlexCoin ""ICO pre-sale launch"" scheduled for August 7, 2017. The PlexCoin Facebook Pagedescribed the PlexCoin Token as ""the next decentralized worldwide cryptocurrency based on theEthereum structure"" whose ""mission is to broaden the possibilities of uses and to increase thenumber of users by simplifying the process of managing cryptocurrency to the maximum.""39. On or around July 5, 2017, Lacroix and PlexCorps also launched a Facebook pagefor PlexCorps with a Facebook address @plexcorps (the ""PlexCorps Facebook Page""), in whichthey stated that PlexCorps consisted of ""a group of roughly forty people (programmers,engineers, cryptocurrency specialists, etc.) all independent throughout the world and orientedtowards the same goal: ""To increase accessibility to cryptoservices by simplifying its managingprocess."" The same post noted that PlexCorps ""decided not to reveal the identities of our team to11Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 11 of 35 PageID #: 11 make sure no one is getting harassed on social media or recruited by other cr3^tocurrencycompanies, thus preventing the concept of PlexCorps from being copied.""40. A later post on the PlexCorps Facebook Page stated that the PlexCorps team was""grow[ing]... every day"" and that it consisted of ""more than 48 all around the world.""41. Lacroix registered the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages and was at allrelevant times the administrator for both accounts. A credit card account in Lacroix's name wasassociated with the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages. On several occasions immediatelybefore and during the sale of PlexCoin Tokens to the public, logins were made to both accountsfrom an IP address previously associated with Lacroix and his businesses, DL Innov and Gestio(""Defendants' IP Address"").42. The PlexCorps and PlexCoin Facebook Pages were accessible via the Internet topotential investors in the United States.43. On or around July of 2017, Lacroix, directly or indirectly, also launched websitesfor PlexCorps and PlexCoin. Lacroix registered at least some of these websites with an intemetservice provider on or around May 24, 2017, including websites with URLshttp://www.plexcoin.org, http://www.plexcoin.com, http://www.plexbank.com, andhttp://www.plexwallet.com, and paid for these registrations in his name. These websites wereaccessible via the Intemet to potential investors in the United States.44. Lacroix also registered and paid for Intemet security services with respect to theURLs http://www.plexcoin.com, http://www.plexcoin.org, and http://www.plexcorps.com,starting at least on July 1, 2017.45. Like the PlexCorps Facebook Page, PlexCorps' website, accessible via the URLhttp://www.plexcorps.com (the ""PlexCorps Website""), described PlexCorps as ""a group of forty12Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 12 of 35 PageID #: 12 people ... all independent throughout the world and oriented towards the same goal: To increaseaccessibility to cryptoservices by simplifying the managing process.""46. The PlexCorps Website listed four additional products offered by PlexCorp, eachwith a unique logo: PlexCoin, PlexWallet, PlexCard, and PlexBank. The logo for PlexCoinlinked users to PlexCoin's website at http://www.plexcoin.com (the ""PlexCoin Website""), andindicated that PlexCoin was at the ""Pre-Sale Waiting List"" stage. The logo for the other productsindicated that they were projected to be launched later in 2017 and or in 2018.47. The PlexCorps Website also directed readers to the PlexCorps Facebook Page.48. From at least July 2017 through the present, the PlexCoin Website states that""PlexCorps presents: PlexCoin,"" which the PlexCoin Website describes as ""a cryptocurrency ...that has a value based on the current market."" In July of 2017, the PlexCoin Website announcedthe ""ICO"" for PlexCoin Tokens would begin on August 7, 2017, and that the pre-sale period wascurrently open to potential investors.49. Under a section entitled ""Frequently Asked Questions"" on the PlexCoin Website,the answer to the question of ""How to Invest?"" instructed users that they would ""have to enter[their] email address"" so that ""at the launch of the pre-sale on August 7, [they] will be able tobuy [their] PlexCoin at a discounted price and in priority, and enjoy a return of 1,354% on yourinvestment!""50. The PlexCoin Website explained that ""[a]n Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is aderivative from the known expression IPO (Initial Public Offering, or stock market launch)which refers to cryptocurrency fundraiser. An ICO can allow the financing of a new blockchain,but in most cases, the ICO is set up to issue a token, a coin or creating a Dapp (decentralizedapplication) based on an already existing blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.""13Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 13 of 35 PageID #: 13 51. In July of 2017, the PlexCoin Facebook Page and the PlexCoin Website bothannounced that a ""whitepaper"" for PlexCoin Tokens (the ""PlexCoin Whitepaper"") would beavailable on August 4, 2017, that the PlexCoin ICO ""pre-sale"" would begin on August 7, 2017,and that PlexCoin Tokens would officially ""launch"" on September 5, 2017.52. Answering the question ""What is the anticipated return on investment (ROI)?,""the PlexCoin Website explained that the return depended ""on the sale stage you will be at whenpurchase your PlexCoin."" The PlexCoin Website further explain that the first 50 millionPlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of $0.13 U.S. Dollars (""USD""), the following50 million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of $0.28 USD, the following 100million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of $0.53 USD, and the last 200 millionPlexCoin Tokens (for a total of 400 million coins sold), would be sold at the equivalent of $0.88USD. Based on the foregoing discounting scheme, the PlexCoin Website projected thatinvestors in PlexCoin Tokens would obtain a ""projected return on investment"" after 29 days,depending on where and when in the discount scheme the investor purchased PlexCoin, of either1,354%, 629%, 332%, or 200%.53. Elsewhere, the PlexCoin Website explained that after the 29 days of the pre-sale,""the value ... will be 1,76 $ [sic] per PlexCoin and it is from that date forward that the valueshould normally increase, as PlexCoin will be from that moment available on the open market.""The PlexCoin Website also explained that the $1.76 USD value assumed that 400 millionPlexCoin Tokens were sold during the PlexCoin pre-sale, but other materials expressedconfidence that all 400 PlexCoin Tokens would be sold and stated that even if fewer were sold,investors would still reap returns that were ""real"" and commensurate to amounts sold.14Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 14 of 35 PageID #: 14 54. From July 2017 through at least October 1, 2017, the PlexCoin Website explainedto investors that they would be able to purchase PlexCoin Tokens during the ICG with eitherUSD, Canadian Dollars (""CAD""), Euros, Bitcoin, Ether (which the PlexCoin Website calls""Ethereum""), and Litecoin.The Quebec Tribunal Enjoins Defendants from Continuing the PlexCoin ICG55. On July 19, 2017, the QAMF made an ex parte application to the Quebec Tribunalbased on many of the foregoing PlexCoin Token marketing efforts and asking, inter alia, that theQuebec Tribunal enjoin Lacroix, PlexCoin, PlexCorps, Gestio, and DL Innov from offering ordistributing investments in PlexCoin Tokens.56. On July 20, 2017, the Quebec Tribunal granted the QAMF's request (the ""JulyOrder"") having concluded, as it explained at a later date, that the PlexCoin Token was a""security"" under the laws of Quebec, relying in part on the United States Supreme Court decisionin SEC V. Howev. 328 U.S. 293 (1946). See also Financial Markets Authoritv v. Plexcorps,TMS, Montreal, 2017-023-001 (July 20, 2017); Financial Markets Authoritv v. Plexcorps, et al.,TMS, Montreal, 2017-023-001 (Sept. 13, 2017).57. In the July Order, the Quebec Tribunal ordered PlexCorps, PlexCoin, DL Innov,Gestio, and Lacroix to, inter alia:a. ""cease engaging directly or indirectly in any activity for the purpose ofmaking any transaction on any form of investment,b. ""withdraw any advertising or solicitation of the same nature as that made onthe Internet sites www.plexcorps.com and www.plexcoin.com, Facebook, anyInternet forums or others, or in relation to securities or any form ofinvestment, whether advertised or disseminated, over the Internet orotherwise, directly or indirectly, [and]c. ""shut down the Internet sites www.plexcorps.com and www.plexcoin.com orany other site of the same nature as those sites, advertised or disseminated,directly or indirectly, by the latter or, failing that, to render them inaccessible15Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 15 of 35 PageID #: 15 to any IP address in Quebec so as to prevent anyone residing in Quebec fromvisiting these Internet sites.""58. The Quebec Tribunal's July Order also ordered a Facebook subsidiary in Canadato shut down the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages from accessibility in Quebec.59. On July 21, 2017, the QAMF served Defendants PlexCoin, PlexCorps, andLacroix, as well as Lacroix's entities DL Innov and Gestio with the Quebec Tribunal's JulyOrder and, on that day. Defendant Lacroix filed a notice of dispute against the decision.60. But Lacroix and PlexCorps did not abide by the Quebec Tribunal's July Order.On October 17, 2017, the Superior Court of Quebec held Lacroix in contempt of the July Order.Sanctions against Lacroix are currently pending for that contempt order.Defying the Quebec Tribunal's Iniunctions, Defendants Continue to Market the PlexCoinTokens to Investors and Begin Raising Investor Funds61. Rather than ceasing advertisement and solicitations for PlexCoin Tokens asrequired by the July Order, Lacroix and PlexCorps took several steps in open defiance of theQuebec Tribunal's July Order including, as further detailed below, (a) publishing a ""whitepaper""for PlexCoin (the ""PlexCoin Whitepaper"") on August 4, 2017; (b) registering online paymentservices accounts to receive PlexCoin investor funds and receiving investor funds through thoseaccounts; (c) shutting down the PlexCoin Website from Quebec IP addresses (but not U.S.addresses) but then registering the domain http://www.plexcoin.tech on August 18, 2017; and (d)posting additional social media and online advertisements for PlexCoin, including in newFacebook accounts associated with PlexCorps and its businesses.62. Lacroix made some of the foregoing attempts to evade the Quebec Tribunal's JulyOrder by enlisting the help of his partner, Paradis-Royer, and by obscuring his involvement withthe registration of new domains or accounts by using a fake name, including but not limited to16Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 16 of 35 PageID #: 16 ""San Lee,"" or ""See Lam,"" and/or using email addresses that belonged to or were under hiscontrol.63. Paradis-Royer did her part to conceal Lacroix's involvement by, for example,registering certain digital payments accounts under her name or purporting to use those accountsfor a fictional business called ""Sidepay.Ca,"" which was really Defendants' alter ego.64. By at least August 3, 2017, the PlexCoin Website stated that ""PlexCorps' team isconstantly working on .. . developing"" certain products associated with PlexCoin Tokens, suchas the PlexWallet and PlexCard, and that the PlexCoin ICO would begin on August 8.65. On or around August 4, 2017, Lacroix and PlexCorps published the PlexCoinWhitepaper on the Internet, which was available to potential investors in the United States.66. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained PlexCoin's logo on the front page,PlexCoin's and PlexCorps' logos in the interim pages, and linked to PlexCoin's and PlexCorps'Websites and Facebook Pages.67. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained many of the same statements that Defendantspreviously made to investors in their various online postings through the summer of 2017.68. For example, the PlexCoin Whitepaper explained that the PlexCoin ""pre-sale""would run during the 29 days from August 7 through September 5, 2017, but set September 10,2017 as the ""launch"" for PlexCoin secondary market trading. The PlexCoin Whitepaper, likeprevious statements by Lacroix and PlexCorps, directed users to register for the ""pre-sale"" byentering their email address in the registration tab of the PlexCoin Website, and advisedinvestors that they could purchase PlexCoin through USD, CAD, Euros, Bitcoin, Ether, orLitecoin.17Case 1:17-cv-07007-CBA-RML   Document 1   Filed 12/01/17   Page 17 of 35 PageID #: 17 69. Th","On December 1, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his company, PlexCorps, in an emergency action to halt an alleged Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud that raised up to $15 million from thousands of investors. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps marketed and sold securities called PlexCoin on the internet to investors in the U.S. and elsewhere, claiming that investments in PlexCoin would yield a 1,354 percent profit in less than 29 days. The SEC also charged Lacroix's partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, in connection with the scheme.  Based on its filing, the SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of PlexCorps, Lacroix, and Paradis-Royer.  The SEC's complaint charges Lacroix, Paradis-Royer, and PlexCorps with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The complaint also alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, and penalties.  For Lacroix, the SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar and a bar from offering digital securities against Lacroix and Paradis-Royer."
33,"1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  THERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA SAVANNAH DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, Civil Action File No. v.      4:18 -CV-00209-WTM -GRS ROBERT WILLIAM DORRANCE, Defendant .     AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF The plaintiff,  Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint and alleges the following: SUMMARY 1. Between at least January 201 5 and February 2016, Defendant Robert William Dorrance (ﬁDorranceﬂ) aided and abetted a scheme by David R. Greenlee (ﬁGreenleeﬂ)  David A. Stewart, Jr. (ﬁStewartﬂ) that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors. 2. During this time , Greenlee, Stewart, their principal salesman, Richard P. Underwood (ﬁUnderwoodﬂ) , and other salesmen whom Greenlee and Stewart recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold  erests in various limited partnersh ips and joint ventures t hat were purportedly created t o extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. 3.   In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would us e investor funds to (a) acquire ﬁworking 2 interestsﬂ in various oil wells and (b) employ enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells.  Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also told investors that the entities wo uld sell the oil in order to earn for investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent, or more, per year ﬁfor decades.ﬂ 4. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, Southern Energy Group, Inc. (ﬁSEGﬂ), which is now adminis tratively dissolved, and Bl ack Gold Resources, Inc. , which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc. (ﬁBGR/Tennstarﬂ). 5. Greenlee, Stewart, and Underwood represented to investors that SEG would manage the limited partnerships and BGR/ Tennstar would man age the joint ventures, and that each of these companies w ould be headed by an individual with meaningful experience in the oil industry. 6. Greenlee and Stewart installed figurehead executives for SEG and BGR/ Tennstar who pretended to run the companies so th at Greenlee and Stewart Šboth convicted felons Šcould conceal their own involvement in the scheme . 7. Dorrance was the figurehead installed over SEG, and he knew that he was falsely portrayed to investors as both running the company and experienced in the oil i ndustry. 8.  Dorrance also substantially assisted the fraud by transferr  investor funds at the direction of Greenlee and Stewart from SEG accounts to accounts that he knew were under Greenlee and Stewart™s control . 9. Dorrance received significant compensation while serving as the figurehead executive for SEG. 3 VIOLATIONS 10. Dorrance, by virtue of his conduct , aided and abetted Greenlee™s and Stewart™s direct violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b -5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b -5]. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and (d) of  Securitie s Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) -(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) -(e)] to e njoin Dorrance from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and transaction s, acts, practices and courses of business of similar purport and object, for disgorgement of illegally obtained funds , prejudgment interest and other equitable relief, and for civil money penalties. 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. 13. The Defendant , directly and indirectly, has made use of the mai  and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 14. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to S ection 22(a) of the Secu rities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business constituting vi olations of the Securities Act and Exchange Act h ave o ccurred within the Southern District of Georgia. 4 DEFENDANT 15. Dorrance , age 61 and a resident of Bowling Green , Kentucky was the purported President of SEG between January 2015 and February 2016, when the fraud ulent offering was halted .  He was selected by Greenlee and Stewart as SEG™s figurehead because he was the uncle of Greenlee™s spouse and willing to take the job.  For most of his working life, Dorrance was a stereo system salesman, who also periodically helped with administrative tasks at his spous  private place of business .  He has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. OTHER RELEVANT PEOPLE AND ENTIT Y 16. David R. Greenlee , age 42, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was convicted in state court and served time in a Kentucky prison during 1999  2000 for forgery and burglary, and again in 2004 for vehicular manslaughter. 17. David A. Stewart, Jr. , age 47, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, is a former registered representative of two Commission -registered broker -dealers in 2001 and 2002 .  In April 2007, Stewart was convicted of federal income tax evasion and sente nced to federal prison. Later, in 2008, the Alabama Securities Commission issued a cease -and -desist order against Stewart, among othe rs, for previously participating in a separate oil and gas offering s cheme .   18. Southern Energy Group, Inc. was a Tennessee corporation and the purported manager of at least four limited partnerships offered to investors.  SEG was administratively dissolved by Tennessee in August 2016 for failure to meet registration renewal requirements. 19. On August 11, 2017, the Commission filed a complaint in SEC v. Tennstar Energy, Inc., et al. , Cas e No. 4:17 -cv-00151 (S.D. Ga.), alleging violation of the antifraud statut es of the federal securities laws  BGR/Tennstar, Greenlee , Stewart  Underwood .      5 FACTS A. Background 20. Between at least January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlee and Stewart, acting individually and through a network of salesmen whom they recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests, called ﬁunits,ﬂ in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, an d Texas. 21. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations ŠSEG for the limited partnerships and BGR/ Tennstar for the joint ventures Šeach of which they promoted as being run by an individual ex perienced in the oil industry. 22. In so liciting investors, Greenlee , Stewart and Underwood represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in various oil wells, employ techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil f rom the wells, and sell the oil to earn investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent or more per year, claiming returns would last f or decades. 23. In fact, while Greenlee and Stewart used some investor money at several wells to create an appearance of acti vity to dupe investors who wanted to see the wells in production, they used nearly two -thirds of the $15 million raised for their own benefit or to pay the costs of conducting the fraud, such as adve rtising and sales commissions. 24. Greenlee, Stewart and Unde rwood also represented that SEG was led by an individual experienced in the oil industry.  In fact , SEG, was not managed  someone with experience in the oil industry.  Instead, Greenlee and Stewart installed a figurehead that had little 6 or no experience in the oil industry and created and distributed a false biograph y that misrepresented that the figurehead had significant relevant experience. 25. Given their criminal backgrounds, Greenlee and Stewart used fake names when soliciting investors to conceal their involvement in the scheme. B. Dorrance Substantially Assisted the Fraudulent Offering 26. Dorrance was the figurehead installed by Greenlee and Stewart in January 2015  run SEG. 27. Dorrance was portrayed to investors as  ning  when , in reality , that entity was controlled by Greenlee and Stewart. 28. Dorrance knowingly allowed himself to be falsely portrayed to investors as running SEG and  being experience d in the oil and gas industry. 29. Specifically, Dorrance knew he was being presented to investo rs as SEG™s President even though he had no actual control over SEG .  Dorrance also knew that he had b  given this title in order to allow Greenlee and Stewart, both of whom he knew were convicted felons, to conceal their own involvement in the scheme. 30. Dorrance acted in his role as SEG™s President solely at the direction of Greenlee and Stewart, who determined his compensation and instructed him in his day -to-day assignments. 31. Dorrance™s work tasks were typically clerical or administrative in nature and included moving investor funds, as instructed by Greenlee and Stewart, from SEG™s bank account to bank accounts of entities that he knew to be under the control of Greenlee and Stewart. 7 32. Dorrance also knowingly allowed Greenlee and Stewart to draft a fake bio graphy  Dorrance and place that fake biography in SEG™s private placement memorandum (ﬁPPMﬂ) .   Dorrance knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the PPM was distributed to investors .  33. This fake biography claimed that Dorrance had ﬁover 30 years of experience in finance, sales, oil & gas, and almost every capacity of corporate America .ﬂ  Dorrance knew this statement was false, at a min imum , because he had no work experienc e in the oil and gas industry. 34. Additionally, Dorrance kn owingly allowed Greenlee and Stewart to feature him prominently on SEG™s website and in SEG brochures with false claims, among others, that he had ﬁ40 years of business experienceﬂ (10 more years than the claim in the PPM) and ﬁassociation[s] with some of the most capable and experienced pr ofessionals in the oil industry. ﬂ This  was false because Dorrance had no such associations. 35. For the approximately thirteen months that Dorrance purportedly served as SEG™s President, he received $3,000 a week plus an occasional bonus, for a total of approximately $166,250 Šall paid from investor funds.

The SEC's complaint alleges that the former president of Southern Energy Group, Inc., Robert William Dorrance, misled investors by failing to disclose that the two individuals actually were running the company instead of Dorrance. Last year, the SEC charged the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling investors that the funds would be used to acquire interests in wells and to recover oil from wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for their personal use. With no background in the oil industry, Dorrance's main work experience was as a former stereo salesman. He largely performed clerical and administrative work at the direction of the two convicted criminals.  Dorrance agreed to be permanently prohibited from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay $101,075 in disgorgement plus interest, and $42,500 in civil penalties, for a total of $143,575.

79,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    §  § Plaintiff,§ v. §  CASE NO. §           CHRISTOPHER JAMES LOLLAR §  § Defendant.§ COMPLAINT Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commissi on (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint against Christopher James Lollar (ﬁLollarﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ), respectfully alleging the following: SUMMARY 1.This is an insider-trading case involv ing Defendant Christopher James LollarŠa former petroleum engineer at Apache Corporatio n (ﬁApacheﬂ), a Texas-ba sed energy exploration and development company.  Lollar illegally used information learned in the course of his employment to enrich himself by trading ahead of the company™s September 7, 2016  announcement of the discovery of a significant new resource play referred to as the ﬁAlpine  Highﬂ (the ﬁAlpine High Announcementﬂ).  In th e days and weeks leading to the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar conducted trades in shares and call option contracts in Apache stock that resulted in total profits of $214,295.07. 2.From January 2014 through December 2016, Lollar worked as a petroleum engineer in Apache™s San Antonio office, where the geologic and geophysical work to explore and develop the Alpine High was performed.  In this capacity, he learned inside information Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 1 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 2 of 12 Complaint about the company™s intention to announce the Alpine High resource play.  After obtaining this material, nonpublic information, Lollar placed, and pr ofited from, illegal trades in shares and call option contracts in Apache stock. 3. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Lollar violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Sec tion 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder. 4. The Commission, in the interest of prot ecting the securities markets from any further unscrupulous and illegal activity, brings this action against Lollar, seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all illicit trading profits he received, plus accrued prejudgment interest, and civil m onetary penalties.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. The Commission brings this action u nder the authority conferred upon it by Sections 21(d) and 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u-1] to enjoin Defendant from further illegal conduct and to seek the imposition of civil penalties. 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this ac tion under Sections 21A and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u-1 and 78aa].      7. Defendant has, directly or indirectly, made use of the mails and of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the fa cilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts, transactions, practices , and courses of business described in this Complaint. 8. Venue is proper in this district because certain of the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred in the Western District of Texas. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 2 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 3 of 12 Complaint DEFENDANT 9. Christopher J. Lollar, age 29, resides in Houston, Texas.  From January 2014 until June 2017, Lollar was a petroleum engineer for Apache Corporation.  From January 2014 through December 2016, he worked in Apache™s San Antonio, Texas office.  In January 2017, Lollar relocated to Apache™s Houston, Texas headquarters where he worked until the company terminated him in June 2017 for breaching its Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   RELATED ENTITY 10. Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.  At all relevant times, Apache™s co mmon stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ﬁAPA.ﬂ STATEMENT OF FACTS  Lollar Joins Apache as a Petroleum Engineer 11. After interning with Apache during the summers of 2012 and 2013, Lollar went to work for the company full-time in January 2014 as a petroleum engineer in the Petroleum Engineering Development Program.  At the time he made the illegal trades, Lollar worked in the Unconventional Resource Drilling Department (ﬁ URD Departmentﬂ) in Apache™s San Antonio office. 12. Upon accepting his internships and full- time position with the company, Lollar acknowledged in writing that he had read, and agreed to abide by, Apache™s corporate codes and policies, including its Code of Business Conduct and Insider Trading Policy.   Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 3 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 4 of 12 Complaint 13. Apache™s Code of Business Conduct prohibited Lollar from ﬁusing corporate property, information or position for personal gain.ﬂ It also prohibited Lollar from disclosing confidential information and from appropriati ng such information for his own use. 14. Apache™s Insider Trading Policy prohibit ed Lollar from trading on material, nonpublic information learned thr ough employment with the co mpany.  The policy included a non-exhaustive list of the type of information the company considers to be material, including ﬁsignificant expansion or curtailment of operationsﬂ and ﬁsignificant new services or discoveries.ﬂ  Apache™s Insider Trading Policy specifically warned Lollar about trading ahead of import newsŠlike the Alpine High Announcemen tŠcautioning that ﬁ[p]erhaps the most dangerous time to engage in a purchase or sale of Apache securities is sh ortly in advance of a public release of important material information–.ﬂ Background on Apache™s Decision to Announce the Alpine High 15. From approximately 2014 through mid-2016, Apache worked to develop the Alpine High resource play through extensive geologic and geophysical work, land accumulation, strategic testing and delineation drilling.  On July 14, 2016, Apache personnel gave a presentation on the Alpine High to Apache™s Board of Directors and certain senior executives (the ﬁBoard Presentationﬂ).  A group of seven San Antonio-based engineers and geologists who had worked on developing the Alpine High, and with whom Lollar worked, assisted in the preparation of the Board Presentation.  It was made clear to the employees working on the Board Presentation that the presentation was confidential.  Although Lollar worked with these employees, he did not work on the Board Presentation. 16. After the Board Presentation, Apache made the decision to publicly announce the Alpine High resource play.  Between August 25, 2016 and September 2, 2016, Apache drafted a press release which it planned to issue on September 7, 2016, before the company™s CEO Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 4 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 5 of 12 Complaint presented at the 2016 Barclays CEO Energy-Powe r Conference (the ﬁB arclays Conferenceﬂ).  Certain company executives, outside financial consultants, and employees specializing in public and investor relations were provided drafts of the press release and the Barclays Conference presentation for their review and comment be fore both were finalized on September 6, 2016. 17. At 6:40 a.m. (ET), before the markets opened on September 7, 2016, Apache made the Alpine High Announcement.  In response to the news, Apache™s stock traded as high as $58.99 per share on September 7, 2016 before clos ing at $55.13 per shareŠan approximately 6.7% increase from the prior day™s closing shar e price of $51.67.  Trading volume that day also increased dramatically to over 14.5 million shares compared with Apache™s historical average daily volume of approximately 2.7 million shar es for the month preceding the Alpine High Announcement. Lollar™s Illegal Trading in Apache Securities 18. In the days and weeks following Apache™s decision to announce the Alpine High, Lollar traded Apache securities in two brokerage accounts: (1) his Fidelity Roth IRA account ending 9413 (the ﬁFidelity accountﬂ); and (2 ) his OptionsHouse account ending 0573 (the ﬁOptionsHouse accountﬂ).   Trading in the Fidelity Account 19. Lollar opened the Fidelity account on February 24, 2016.  There is no evidence that Lollar traded in Apache securities in the Fidelity account prior to August 2016. 20. In August 2016, Lollar sold all of the securities he held in the Fidelity account.  He used the proceeds from that sale, and almost all the cash in the account, to purchase a total of 461 shares of Apache common stock on August 18 and 23, 2016, at a total cost of approximately  $24,580.60 (excluding commissions or ot her transaction fees).  He made these purchases after the Board Presentation and Apache™s decision to publicly announce the Alpine High.  Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 5 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 6 of 12 Complaint 21. On September 9, 2016, two days after the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar sold all 461 shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $26,954.67 and a net profit of $2,374.07.   Trading in the OptionsHouse Account 22. Lollar opened the OptionsHouse account on January 16, 2015.  Prior to September 6, 2016, no Apache securities were trad ed in the OptionsHouse account. 23. On September 1, 2016, in a recorded tele phone call to OptionsHouse™s customer service department, Lollar expressed concern about a notice he received that a $5,000 incoming electronic transfer or deposit request (the ﬁDeposit Requestﬂ) into the OptionsHouse account would not be available until September 8, 2016. Lollar asked that the Deposit Request be cancelled and that a wire transfer be initiated the next day (September 2, 2016) so that the funds would be available immediately for a trade he wanted to make ﬁon [the] open of next week which would be Tuesday, the 7th [of September].ﬂ 1  Lollar was told the Deposit Request was still in progress and that there might be a chance it could be cancelled. 24. OptionsHouse did in fact cancel the Deposit Request.  OptionsHouse account records reflect that $5,000 was deposited in Lollar™s account on September 2, 2016.  An additional $1,200 was wired into Lollar™s Op tionsHouse account on September 6, 2016.  That same day, Lollar used the wired funds and ex isting margin funds to purchase 490 Apache call option contracts in the OptionsHouse account at a cost of approximately $7,275.00. 25. The options had an expiration date of September 9, 2016, and strike prices that varied between $52.50 and $53.50.  Apache™s stock price on September 6, 2016 opened at 1  On this call, Lollar incorrectly stated that the following Tuesday was September 7th.  In fact, he needed the funds available to purchase the three-day options contracts on Tuesday, September 6, 2016, in advance of Apache™s Alpine High Announcement, which took place before the markets opened on Wednesday, September 7, 2016.  The markets were closed on Monday, September 5, 2016, for the Labor Day holiday. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 6 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 7 of 12 Complaint $51.38, had a high of $52.00 and closed at $51.67, thus the three-day options were out-of-the-money when Lollar bought them.  For Lollar™s ca ll options to be in-the-money on September 6, 2016, Apache™s closing stock price would have ha d to have been higher by between $.84 to $1.84, or 1.6% and 3.7%, respectively, as summarized below: Strike Price No. of Option Contracts Apache Closing Price on 9/6/2016 Min. Increase in 9/6/16 Close  to be in-the-money % Increase $52.50 35 $51.67 $.84 1.6% $53.00 105 $51.67 $1.34 2.6% $53.50 350 $51.67 $1.84 3.7% 26. As this chart shows, Lollar expected a market moving event to take place in connection with Apache™s stock before Septembe r 9, 2016.  Notably, Apache had no earnings or other announcements scheduled between September 6 and 9, 2016.  On September 6, 2016,  Apache announced on its Facebook page and LinkedIn account that Apache™s CEO would be  making a presentation at the Barclays Confer ence on September 7, 2016, but no specifics were provided about the content of the presentation.      27. On September 7, 2016, later the same da y of the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar sold all 490 Apache call option contracts, resulting in to tal proceeds of approximately $219,196.00, and profits of approximately $211,921.00.  Th ese profits far exceeded the profits of any of Lollar™s other options trading in the OptionsHouse account since its inception in January 2015. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 7 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 8 of 12 Complaint 28. Because of the high percentage change in the value of the OptionsHouse account, 2 OptionsHouse opened its own internal fraud investigation into Lollar™s trading in Apache securities on September 8, 2016.  OptionsHouse u ltimately closed Lollar™s account on September 12, 2016, and he was informed of its decision on September 20, 2016. Summary of Illegal Trading Activity and Profits 29. The following table summarizes Lollar™s trading profits in Apache stock and options (excluding commissions and other tran saction fees) during the relevant period: Stock Purchases and Sales (Fidelity Account) Trade Date Buy Quantity (Shares) Sell Quantity (Shares) Share Price Purchase Costs Sales Proceeds Profit 8/18/2016 250  $53.55 $13,380.15 $2,374.07 8/23/2016 211  $53.12 $11,200.45 9/9/2016  (461) $58.47  $26,954.67 TOTAL  (461) $24,580.60 $26,954.67 Call Option Purchases and Sales (OptionsHouse Account) Trade Date Strike Price Buy Quantity  No. of Contracts Sell Quantity No. of Contracts Unit Price Purchase Costs Sales Proceeds Profit 9/6/2016 $52.50 35  $.29 $1,015.00 $211,921.00 9/6/2016 $53.00 105  $.18-$.22 $2,110.00 9/6/2016 $53.50 150  $.11-$.13 $4,150.00 9/7/2016 $52.50  (35) $4.70  $16,450.00 9/7/2016 $53.00  (105) $4.15-$5.58  $51,415.00 9/7/2016 $53.50  (350) $3.27- $4.80  $151,331.00 TOTAL  (490) $7,275.00 $219,196.00 TOTAL COMBINED TRADING PROFITS $214,295.07 Lollar™s Inside Information 30. Lollar had ample opportunity to learn inside information about the impending Alpine High Announcement through his work as a pe troleum engineer for Apache.  At the time 2  The value of Lollar™s OptionsHouse account increased by approximately 2,700% between September 6, 2016 (account value of $7,478) and September 7, 2016 (account value of $212,639.41). Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 8 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 9 of 12 Complaint he made the illegal trades, Lollar was working in the URD Department in Apache™s San Antonio office where the geologic and geophysical work that went into developing the Alpine High occurred.  In this position, Lollar worked alongside the team of engineers and geologists that were actively working on the development of the Alpine Hig h.  During the course of his employment, Lollar had regular contact wit h, and access to, many of the engineers and geologists that assisted in preparing the Board Presentation.  He also would have been provided high level information about the development of the Alpine High through staff meetings and daily email reports. 31. In addition to Lollar™s suspiciously timed trades and his access to Apache™s San Antonio-based URD Department, it is clear that Lollar illegally traded based on material, non- public information because: a. Lollar liquidated all the securities in his Fidelity account and used the proceeds, along with almost all the availa ble cash in the account, to purchase Apache stock shortly before the Alpine High Announcement; b. Lollar used almost all of the availa ble funds in his OptionsHouse account to purchase Apache stock options.  No other securities were held, acquired, or sold in September 2016 in the OptionsHouse account; c. Lollar™s September 1, 2016 telephone call to OptionsHouse revealed that he was concerned about transferring funds into the OptionsHouse account prior to September 6th so he could purchase the cal l option contracts before the Alpine High Announcement; d. Lollar purchased out-of-the-money call option contracts with a three-day expiration period, evidencing a high degree of confidence in the likely outcome of the trade; Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 9 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar Page 10 of 12 Complaint e. The accounts in which Lollar made th ese purchases never maintained a position in Apache securities prio r to the subject purchases; f. When questioned about the trades by Commission staff, Lollar made many statements that were contradicted by information found in the public domain and elsewhere; and  g. Apache terminated Lollar in June 2017 for breaching the company™s Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   32. In short, Lollar was willing to liquidate his Fidelity account to purchase Apache stockŠwhich he had never purchased in that account beforeŠand was willing to bet all of the funds in his OptionsHouse account on a rapid incr ease in the price of Apache stock in just a three-day time frame.  He was only willing to make this bet because of the inside information he had obtainedŠthat Apache was about to make a major public announcement about the Alpine High play.  He then used that inside informa tion to make illegal insider trades and realized substantial profits as a result.

The SEC alleges in its complaint, filed on November 1, 2017, that Christopher J. Lollar traded on nonpublic information while working in the company's San Antonio office that was performing the geologic and geophysical work to explore and develop the newly-discovered resource play called Alpine High. Lollar allegedly conducted trades in Apache shares and call options in the days and weeks leading up to the company's Alpine High announcement on Sept. 7, 2016.

The SEC's complaint charges Lollar with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Lollar consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and orders him to pay disgorgement of $214,295.07 plus $7,219.36 in interest and a $214,295.07 penalty for a total of $435,809.50.  The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Fort Worth office by Tamara F. McCreary and Ty S. Martinez with assistance from Christopher Davis."

Defendants Santillo and Parris buy or take over books of business of retiringinvestment professionals from around the country. Then Santillo and Parris, or local salespeople, including Defendants Piccarreto, LaRocco, and Brenner, persuade these newly acquiredclients Štheir victims Š to withdraw their savings from traditional investments and invest inissuers controlled by Santillo, Parris, or their associates, including Defendants First Nationle,Percipience, and United RL. The bulk of the more than $102 million raised in this fraud waspurportedly raised for these three issuers.2. Defendants falsely claim that their investors' money will be used to operatebusinesses in fields such as financial services, insurance, real estate development, and medicallaboratories. In fact, any business operations for each issuer appear to be limited or non-existent.After receiving investor funds, Defendants transfer those funds through multiple accounts held inthe names of different entities Defendants control, commingling the funds, then transfer thefunds elsewhere.3. As one example, Piccarreto met with an investor from Austin, Texas in February2015. Because the investor suffers from dementia and was nearly 80 years old at the time, hisdaughter attended the meeting as well. Piccarreto convinced the elderly investor to put $250,000in Percipience, describing it as areal-estate investment. On March 5, 2015, that money wasdeposited into Percipience's bank account, then promptly transferred through affiliate bankaccounts Šfrom which Piccarreto misappropriated $21,500 Šand through First Nationle's bankaccount Šfrom which Santillo misappropriated $172,800. More than two years later, after theinvestor's daughter expressed concern about his investments to Piccarreto, Piccarreto falselywrote in an e-mail, ""I know this is scary for you and you are just looking out for dad but Ipromise you I will not let anything happen to any of the money."" In fact, Defendants knew they2 were lying to investors and stealing their money. And this investor has never received anymoney back from his investment in Percipience.4. Defendants have enriched themselves greatly through the money they stole frominvestors. Santillo has misappropriated at least $13.4 million; Parris has misappropriated at least$1.1 million; LaRocco has misappropriated at least $1.1 million; Piccarreto has misappropriatedat least $1.3 million; and Brenner has misappropriated at least $2.9 million.As an example of Defendants' use of stolen investor funds, Santillo uses thatstolen money to fund ajet-setting lifestyle, including paying for housing in multiple states, carleases, expenditures at a country club and a Las Vegas resort and casino, credit card payments,and other personal expenses. At the same time he was misappropriating investor funds, Santillothrew himself a party at a nightclub in Las Vegas for which he commissioned a song abouthimself to be played. The lyrics to that song refer to (Perry) Santillo as ""King Perry"" anddescribe his typical attire: ""ten-thousand-dollar suit everywhere he rides."" The song also depictshis lifestyle as follows: ""pop the champagne in L.A., New York to Florida; buy another bottlejust to spray it all over ya.""6. Of the at least $102 million raised by Defendants, the majority of it was eithermisappropriated by Defendants or paid to redeeming investors in classic Ponzi-scheme fashion.VIOLATIONS7.

First Nationle purports to conductbusiness in areas including leveraged investments, the financial services industry, insurance, andreal estate development, among others. The Commission is not aware of evidence that indicatesthat First Nationle conducts more than some minimal business. Rather, Defendants operate FirstNationle primarily as a Ponzi scheme by issuing securities in the form of promissory notes,soliciting and then misappropriating substantial amounts of investor funds, and using remaininginvestor funds to pay off redeeming investors.20. Percipience is a Delaware Corporation. Percipience purports to conduct businessby providing loans to borrowers to buy and improve single-family houses. The Commission isnot aware of evidence that indicates that Percipience conducts more than some minimal business.Rather, Defendants operate Percipience primarily as a Ponzi scheme by issuing securities in theform of stock, soliciting and then misappropriating substantial amounts of investor funds, andusing remaining investor funds to pay off redeeming investors.21.

Santillo and Parris buy books of business from investment professionals around7 the country, then solicit investors from those books with the aid of the other IndividualDefendants. With investor victims located throughout the country, Santillo and Parris haverelied on individuals with long-established ties to, and trust within, certain communities todefraud investors in those communities. LaRocco has been a central figure in defraudinginvestors in Florida, where Santillo and LaRocco and potentially others raised at least $26million from at least 147 investors since August 2012. Piccarreto has been a central figure indefrauding investors in Texas, where Parris and Piccarreto and potentially others raised at least$6.6 million from at least 38 investors since Apri,12014. Brenner has been a central figure inOhio, where Santillo, Parris, and Brenner and potentially others raised at least $8 million from atleast 74 investors since Apri12013.23. Santillo, Parris, and Piccarreto also raised money from investors in other states.For example, Santillo, Parris, and Piccarreto raised at least $21 million from at least 80 investorsin California since May 2012, Santillo raised $3.5 million from at least 33 investors inPennsylvania since June 2015, and more recently Santillo raised at least $2.2 million from atleast 24 investors in Maryland since late 2017.24. In total, Defendants have raised at least $102 million from at least 637 investorssince at least July 2011 through their fraudulent offerings. Of that $102 million, the majority ofthe investor funds was either misappropriated by Defendants or paid to redeeming investors.The Fraudulent Offerings25. First Nationle: Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, and potentially others, haveinduced at least 318 investors to invest at least $46 million in the First Nationle offering sinceFebruary 2012. A First Nationle brochure provided to investors and potential investors claimsthat First Nationle is a holding company for ""several sales affiliates that represent a group of companies who offer a rich portfolio of premier Insurance and Impaired Risk products ...Thesesubsidiaries manage over $145 million in assets."" The Commission is not aware of anyevidence that indicates that First Nationle is a holding company for any subsidiaries, much lesssubsidiaries with assets of $145 million. The Commission is also not aware of any evidence thatindicates that First Nationle conducts anything more than minimal business functions.26. First Nationle's website claims that it ""is engaged in leveraging inveshnents,holdings, and other assets, while building value for investors."" First Nationle's operatingagreement claims it engages in businesses including ""the acquisition, ownership, development,preservation or operation of ...stock, mortgages, notes, receivables, securities and realty....""First Nationle's subscription agreement, which it provided to investors, claims that it is ""engagedin the business of senior market insurance program commerce and the development andmanagement of diverse real property holdings.""27. The subscription agreement describes the investment as follows: ""The debtorplans to apply the proceeds of the offering to help fund the debtor's outlined business model.""The subscription agreement further claims that ""[nJone of the proceeds from the offering willinure to the personal benefit of the Manager."" The First Nationle operating agreement providedto investors identifies Santillo as the manager of First Nationle, while the subscription agreementidentifies Lucian Global, LLC as manager. Parris is the manager of Lucian Global LLC, andthus a de facto co-manager of First Nationle along with Santillo.28. First Nationle offered promissory notes to investors. The promissory notesoffered and sold by Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, and Piccarreto typically contain maturity dates ofthree years, and provide for interest payments at an annual rate ranging from 3.3% to 6%, as wellas bonuses ranging from approximately 10% to 19% to be credited to the investor upon initially investing.29. Percipience: Santillo, Parris, Piccarreto, Brenner, and potentially others, haveinduced at least 229 investors to invest at least $22 million in the Percipience offering since July2012. A 2013 Percipience private placement memorandum (""PPM"") claims that Percipience'sbusiness is to provide loans to borrowers to buy and improve single-family houses. TheCommission is not aware of any evidence that indicates that Percipience conducts anything morethan minimal business functions. The PPM further claims that in the event of raising amaximum $S million in the offering, $4.25 million (or 85% of the proceeds) will be used forPercipience's business, with the remainder of the proceeds to be spent on expenses such as~,brokers fees.30. Percipience's program summary claims that its business includes ""(a) short-termproperly acquisition and resale, (b) purchase of distressed non-performing bank notes forprofitable repositioning, and (c) property rental income."" Percipience's operating agreementclaims that it ""shall purchase ...stand-alone homes or ...flats within amulti-family building""and ""lease residences to families supported by governmentally funded rent subsidies....""Percipience's private placement memorandum claims that it will ""will own, fund and operate [a]real-estate-financing business....""31. Percipience offered investors preferred stock, specifically Class A and Class Bshares. Class A shares have a one year ""lock period,"" with a claimed annual return of 7%. ClassB shares have a three year ""lock period,"" with a claimed annual return of 8%and an 8%bonus tobe credited to the investor upon initially investing.32. United RL: Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, Brenner, and potentially others,have induced at least 183 investors to invest at least $25 million in the United RL offering since10 March 2015. United RL's Operating Agreement describes Parris and LaRocco as members ofUnited RL. A United RL brochure and PPM claim that United RL's business is to make loans tophysicians or medical practices for the purpose of owning their own toxicology laboratories formedical tests. The Commission is not aware of any evidence that indicates that United RLconducts anything more than minimal business functions.33. United RL's website claims that it ""is asingular-disciplined company thatspecializes in providing Physician's financing, supporting the initial development phases ofPhysician owned clinical laboratories."" United RL's operating agreement claims that itsoperations ""encompass the direct or indirect (i) financing ofinedical-laboratory acquisitionsand/or operations owned by third parties, and (ii) conduct of all commercial operations relatedthereto or supportive thereof."" The United RL Brochure provided to investors states that UnitedRL ""provide[s] program financing ...for the following specialties: hospitals, OBGYN's painmanagement, internist and primary care physicians.""34. United RL offered promissory notes to investors. The promissory notes hadmaturity dates of either one year (""short term"") or three years (either ""medium term"" or ""longterm""). The terms of the notes include claimed 7% interest payments to be paid semi-annuallyand claimed bonus payments of 7% on the three-year promissory notes, to be credited to theinvestor upon initially investing.35. Other Fraudulent  Middlebury Development Corporation from at least 23 investors; (3) $1.1 million raised inLucian Development Corporation from at least 14 investors; and (4) $758,000 raised in Torr,LLC from at least 13 investors.The Misrepresentations, Omissions, Misappropriations, and Breaches of Fiduciary Duty36. The Defendants have misrepresented to investors and potential investors thatthe money they invest in First Nationle, Percipience, United RL, or other issuers, is used toconduct the purported business of each respective issuer. Investors are not told that Š in fact Š asignificant portion of investor proceeds is used to repay redeeming investors or aremisappropriated for personal use by Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, and Brenner.37. Rather than deposit investors' funds with the issuers to be used for businesspurposes, Defendants commingled investors' funds. After receiving investor funds, Defendantstransferred those funds through multiple accounts held in the names of different entitiesDefendants control (including but not limited to First Nationle, Percipience, and United RL) thentransfer the funds elsewhere. Substantial amounts of these funds are transferred to redeeminginvestors or to Santillo or the other Individual Defendants. In some cases, Santillo transferrednearly all of an investor deposit to himself. In other cases the transfers were more complex, withDefendants commingling investor funds in different accounts and transferring the moneyelsewhere, including to themselves and to redeeming investors.38. Of the at least $102 million that Defendants have raised from investors,Santillo has misappropriated at least $13.4 million. In addition to this $13.4 million, Santilloreceived additional money transfers totaling at least $12 million, which he did not keep, buttransferred back into the accounts held in the names of different entities Defendants control(including but not limited to First Nationle, Percipience, and United RL). Additionally, Parris12 has misappropriated at least $1.1 million; LaRocco has misappropriated at least $1.1 million;Piccarreto has misappropriated at least $1.3 million; and Brenner has misappropriated at least$2.9 million.39. Defendants also misrepresented to investors the ongoing performance Š or lackthereof Š of their investments. Defendants provided account statements to investors falselystating that their funds were invested in the issuers, falsely stating investment returns, and insome cases falsely stating that a bonus had been credited to their account. In certain cases,Defendants provided investors with bonus funds or interest payments. In other cases,Defendants provided redeeming investors with their all or part of their funds, with returns.These were Ponzi payments derived from new investor funds rather than actual investmentreturns. Defendants have failed to fulfill,the request of other investors to redeem theirinvestments.40. Of the at least $102 million raised by Defendants, at least $38.5 million waspaid to out to earlier investors in Ponzi payments, at least $20 million was transferred to personalbank accounts of the Individual Defendants, and a large portion of the remaining funds wastransferred elsewhere in transactions that do not appear related to the Entity Defendants'purported businesses.41. Each of the Individual Defendants acted as investment advisers. Santillopurchased at least several investment advisory businesses, and then continued the business ofthose investment advisers, acting as an investment adviser himself. In addition to purchasinginvestment advisory businesses, Santillo advised clients regarding securities. He receivedcompensation through the misappropriation of investor funds. Additionally, Parris, Piccarreto,LaRocco, and Brenner presented themselves to investors as investment advisers who were acting13 in the interests of individual investors; they reviewed investors' portfolios of investments;provided investment advice regarding investments in securities; and they each receivedcompensation through misappropriated investor funds.42. The Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to theinvestors when they failed to use investor funds as they represented they would, and when theyfailed to inform investors that they were misappropriating their funds. In short, the IndividualDefendants failed to put their customers' interests before their own.Specific Misrepresentations and Omissions to Investors 1-743. Investors 1 and 2: In July 2014, Parris and Piccarreto met with Investors 1 and2, a husband and wife from Cedar Crest, New Mexico, to discuss investment opportunities.Parris and Piccarreto described two opportunities for investment: (1) First Nationle, which theyclaimed to be an investment related to commercial real estate; and (2) Percipience, which theyclaimed to be an investment related to residential real estate. Parris and Piccarreto told Investors1 and 2 that invested funds would be used to conduct the business of each respective issuer.Parris and Piccarreto also provided written documents related to the offerings. Parris andPiccarreto presented themselves as investment experts and recommended that Investors 1 and 2invest in First Nationle and Percipience.44. After meeting with Parris and Piccarreto, Investor 1 invested $76,000 inPercipience and Investor 2 invested $125,000 in Percipience. Investor 2 also invested $233,000in First Nationle. Parris described these as safe investments for athree-year term. Investors 1and 2 expected to receive their investments back, with interest, in July 2017. But to date theirinvestments have not Ueen repaid.45. An analysis of bank records shows that Investors 1 and 2's investments in14 Percipience were not used to conduct its purported business: Rather, some of the funds were usedto make payments to what appears to be another investor, while other funds weremisappropriated by Parris. Investors 1 and 2's investments in Percipience were placed into aPercipience bank account (with a previous balance of about $450), combined with anotherinvestor deposit of $20,000, then transferred among a variety of accounts not belonging toPercipience, including the accounts of First Nationle, and a manager of First Nationle. Themajority of those funds were then used to pay what appears to be another investor, while Parrisreceived $15,000.46. Similarly, Investor 2's investment in First Nationle was not used to conduct itspurported business. Rather, some of the funds were misappropriated by Santillo while otherfunds were paid to associates or entities controlled by associates of the Individual Defendants.Specifically, Investor 2's investment in First Nationle was placed into a First Nationle bankaccount (with a previous balance of about $57,000), combined with other investor deposits ofabout $530,000, then $480,000 was transferred to Santillo. Santillo misappropriated $100,000 ofthose funds, and transferred the remaining $370,000 back to the First Nationle account, fromwhich it was used to pay other investors.47. Investor 3 and leis daughter: In February 2015, Piccarreto met with Investor 3 Šwho suffers from dementia Šand his daughter at their home in Austin, Texas to discussinvestment opportunities. Piccarreto described an opportunity to invest in Percipience, which hetold Investor 3 was an investment in real estate. Piccarreto claimed that invested funds would beused to conduct the business of Percipience. Piccarreto wrote in an e-mail to Investor 3'sdaughter: ""I can generate enough interest (dividend payments) to cover [your father's] rent .. .while not touching the principal.... We will not be making double digit returns but we will also15 not have the risk of the stock market. We will have a fixed guaranteed dividend that will serve asincome to take care of expenses."" Piccarreto also provided written documents related to theoffering.48. After meeting with Piccarreto in 2015, Investor 3 invested $250,000 inPercipience under his daughter's name. Later, in June 2017, Piccarreto again met with Investor 3and his daughter to discuss additional investment opportunities. Subsequently, Piccarreto visitedInvestor 3 alone and obtained a $60,000 check from him, despite knowing of his dementia. Afterlearning that Piccarreto had done this, Investor 3's daughter asked for written documentation.about this new investment.. Piccarreto provided a brief document by e-mail, in which he stated ""Iknow this is scary for you and you are just looking out for dad but I promise you I will not letanything happen to any of the money."" Investor 3 and his daughter then decided not to goforward with this new investment. However, Piccarreto had already cashed the $60,000 check Šwhich had been made out to United RL.49. Investor 3 and his daughter asked for a refiind of their investment, but most of themoney has not been refunded. In late January 2018, Investor 3 received a $10,000 check fromPiccarreto. The check was drawn on an account of a third-party company unknown to Investor 3and his daughter. Investor 3's daughter called Piccarreto to ask where the rest of her father'smoney was, and Piccarreto said he did not know.50. An analysis of bank records shows that Investor 3's investment in Percipiencewas not used to conduct its purported business. Rather, a large portion of the funds weremisappropriated by Santillo and Piccarreto. Investor 3's investment in Percipience was placedinto a Percipience bank account (with a previous balance of about $717), combined with anotherinvestor deposit of $200,000, then transferred among a variety of accounts not belonging to16 Percipience, including the accounts of First Nationle and a manager of First Nationle. Santilloreceived $172,000 of those funds, while Piccarreto received $5,000, and some of the remainingfunds were transferred to accounts of other entities controlled by Santillo and his associates.51. Investors 4 and 5: In July 2016 Investors 4 and 5, a husband and wife fromSalinas, California, learned from their financial advisor that he had sold his wealth managementbusiness to Santillo. The financial advisor introduced Investors 4 and 5 to Santillo, and anotherindividual who worked with Santillo. In November 2016, Santillo and Piccarreto met withInvestors 4 and 5 to discuss investment opportunities. Santillo and Piccarreto described twoopportunities for investment: (1) First Nationle, which they claimed to be an investment relatedto real estate; and (2) United RL, which they claimed was a company related to the medical field.Santillo and Piccarreto claimed the funds Investor 4 and 5 invested would be used to conduct thebusiness of each respective issuer. Santillo and Piccarreto also provided written documentsrelated to the offerings.52. After meeting with Santillo and Piccarreto, Investor 4 invested $217,000 in FirstNationle and $217,000 in United RL. Investor 4 also invested $233,000 in First Nationle. InFebruary 2017, Investor 5 invested $124,000 in First Nationle. Also in February 2017, Investors4 and 5 agreed to place an additional approximately $168,000 in their self-directed IRA accountsand decide where to invest that money at a later date. But in August 2017 they learned that themoney had been taken from their self-directed IRA accounts and invested without theirpermission, 50% in First Nationle and 50% in United RL. Thereafter, Investors 4 and 5requested a refund of their money and Piccarreto claimed they would get their money back inDecember 2017. To date Investors 4 and 5 have received $75,000 back, but have not receivedthe remainder of their investments.17 53. Investor 6: During 2016, LaRocco met with Investor 6 from Ocklawaha, Floridato discuss investment opportunities. Through LaRocco, Investor 6's father had previouslyinvested approximately $510,000 in First Nationle. After Investor 6's father passed away,LaRocco provided advice and guidance to Investor 6 about her father's assets. LaRoccoconvinced Investor 6 to maintain her father's investment in First Nationle and also to invest$450,000 of her own money in United RL. LaRocco told Investor 6 that her investment fundswould be used for United RL's business of funding medical laboratories. LaRocco also providedwritten documents related to the offerings.54. After several meetings with LaRocco, Investor 6 invested $450,000 in United RLin in several installments between July and September 2016.

The complaint alleges that investors were told that their funds would be used for the companies and some were guaranteed dividends or double-digit returns.  But, according to the complaint, the defendants spent at least $20 million to enrich themselves, paid $38.5 million in Ponzi-like payments, and transferred much of the remainder in transactions that appear unrelated to the issuers' purported businesses.  The complaint charges Perry Santillo, of Rochester, New York, Christopher Parris, also of Rochester, Paul LaRocco, of Ocala, Florida, John Piccarreto, of San Antonio, and Thomas Brenner, of Orville, Ohio, along with the three companies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, Brenner, and the three issuers with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It further charges Santillo, Parris, LaRocco, Piccarreto, and Brenner with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and aiding and abetting the three issuers' violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order.  The court will hold a hearing in 10 days concerning the asset freeze and will consider ordering a preliminary injunction.
