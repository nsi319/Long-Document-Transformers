17,"1  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO  Civil Action No. 18-cv-02381  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,  Plaintiff, v.  CLOVIS ONCOLOGY, INC., PATRICK J. MAHAFFY, and ERLE T. MAST  Defendants.   COMPLAINT   Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁSECﬂ or ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint against Clovis Oncology, Inc., Patrick J. Mahaffy, and Erle T. Mast (collectively, the ﬁdefendantsﬂ) alleges as follows: NATURE OF THE ACTION  1. From approximately July 8, 2015 through November 16, 2015 (the ﬁrelevant time periodﬂ), Clovis Oncology, Inc. (ﬁClovisﬂ or the ﬁcompanyﬂ), a biopharmaceutical company based in Boulder, Colorado and listed on NASDAQ, and its current Chief Executive Officer (ﬁCEOﬂ), Patrick Mahaffy (ﬁMahaffyﬂ), negligently made untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements they made not misleading to investors about its then flagship lung cancer drug, rociletinib (ﬁRociﬂ). Clovis™ former Chief Financial Officer (ﬁCFOﬂ), Erle Mast (ﬁMastﬂ), aided and abetted such untrue statements and/or omissions. For investors, Clovis™ value in 2015 was directly tied to the ability of Roci to compete in the market for lung cancer drugs. One important driver of the competition Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 15 2  was Roci™s ﬁefficacyﬂ Œ how well the drug worked Œ and how that efficacy compared to a drug simultaneously under development by another biopharmaceutical company, referred to herein as ﬁDRUG X.ﬂ 2. On May 31, 2015, Clovis disclosed to investors at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ﬁASCOﬂ) conference, that Roci™s efficacy, referred to as Objective Response Rate (ﬁORRﬂ), in ongoing clinical trials was 60% for its 500mg dose, meaning that in 60% of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. That Roci™s efficacy was 60% was material to investors, as investors believed that this efficacy rate was almost identical to DRUG X, which had a disclosed efficacy rate at the time of 63%. Investors therefore valued Clovis stock assuming that Roci would capture meaningful market share. 3. Shortly after the May 31, 2015 disclosure, the data provided to Mahaffy, Mast, and other Clovis senior executives began to show that Roci™s efficacy rate was materially lower than 60%. In mid-June 2015, Clovis™ updated Roci data provided to Mahaffy showed an ORR in the mid-40s. On July 7, 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the Roci data that would be submitted in the initial submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (ﬁFDAﬂ) for Roci™s approval showed an ORR of 42%. 4. While Clovis™ non-public data, which was used to prepare its submission to the FDA, showed an ORR below 60%, Clovis continued citing to the May 2015 ASCO conference and its disclosure that Roci™s ORR was 60%. On July 8, 2015, Clovis referenced the May 2015 ASCO conference and the 60% ORR for Roci in the solicitation materials for a $298 million offering of its securities (the ﬁOfferingﬂ). After the Offering, Clovis continued to repeat the 60% ORR in public disclosures. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 15 3  5. On November 9, 2015, the FDA informed Clovis that it disagreed with Clovis™ calculation of the efficacy results for Roci, that an accurate calculation of Roci™s efficacy put the ORR in the 20s, and that Clovis must provide new calculations to the FDA by November 16, 2015. On November 10, 2015, Clovis attended an investor conference and referenced the May 2015 ASCO conference and the 60% ORR figure, but without disclosing that the FDA had told Clovis it disagreed with Clovis™ efficacy analysis. 6. On November 16, 2015, Clovis disclosed the true ORR, as calculated by the methodology required by the FDA, telling the market that Roci™s ORR was 28%. The stock price collapsed as a result, dropping approximately 70% from $99.43 to $30.24 per share. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  7. The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)-(e) and 78aa]. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint. 8. Venue lies in this judicial district pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 77u(a) and 78aa and 18 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). Defendants Mahaffy and Mast reside in this district, Clovis™ principal place of business is in this district, and violations occurred in this district. DEFENDANTS  9. CLOVIS ONCOLOGY, INC., a Delaware corporation, is a biopharmaceutical company with its principal place of business in Boulder, Colorado. Clovis™ securities are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and its common stock is listed on NASDAQ Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 15 4  (ticker symbol: CLVS). Clovis files periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act and related rules thereunder. Throughout the relevant time period, Clovis issued stock to its employees in connection with their exercise of stock options pursuant to Clovis™ stock incentive plan. 10. PATRICK J. MAHAFFY is a resident of this district. Since 2009, he has served as CEO and a director of Clovis. As CEO, Mahaffy reviewed and approved Clovis press releases and filings with the Commission. 11. ERLE T. MAST is a resident of this district. From 2009 to 2016, he served as CFO of Clovis. As CFO, Mast reviewed and approved Clovis press releases and reviewed, approved, and signed Clovis filings with the Commission. During the relevant time period, Mast sold Clovis securities, pursuant to a pre-established 10b5-1 plan, at inflated prices. FACTS  Development of Roci  12. There are various types of lung cancer, one of which is referred to as non-small cell lung cancer (ﬁNSCLCﬂ). Some NSCLC patients can be treated with a class of drugs referred to as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ﬁTKIsﬂ). However, many patients™ disease will progress after treatment on TKIs because of an acquired resistance mutation called a ﬁT790Mﬂ mutation. As a consequence of this mutation, patients become resistant to TKI therapy. Clovis developed Roci to treat NSCLC patients who become resistant to TKIs due to the emergence of the T790M mutation. 13. Before Roci could be sold in the U.S., Clovis needed to obtain approval from the FDA. In March 2012, Clovis began the Phase 1 portion of a Roci clinical trial referred to as ﬁTIGER-X.ﬂ The objective of the Phase 1 portion of TIGER-X was to evaluate Roci™s safety Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 15 5  and determine the appropriate dose for further trials. The Phase 2 portion of TIGER-X, measuring, among other things, Roci™s efficacy, began in February 2014. Clovis publicly disclosed that the primary endpoint of the TIGER-X Phase 2 clinical trial was ORR Œ ﬁObjective Response Rate–per RECIST.ﬂ 14. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (ﬁRECISTﬂ) guidelines are an industry-standard set of guidelines used in evaluating the response, measured by tumor shrinkage, to a cancer drug. Clovis™ protocol for the TIGER-X trial required, per RECIST, that in order for tumor shrinkage to qualify as a response, among other criteria, the targeted tumor must shrink at least 30% and the tumor shrinkage must be sustained in a follow-up examination. This latter requirement is referred to as ﬁconfirmation.ﬂ 15. The data from TIGER-X, and another ongoing Roci clinical trial called TIGER-2 (a Phase 2 study evaluating efficacy that began enrolling patients in June 2014), formed the basis of Clovis™ New Drug Application (ﬁNDAﬂ) submitted to the FDA. The TIGER-X and TIGER-2 data were also going to be used to support Roci™s proposed labeling. A drug™s ﬁlabelﬂ is the printed information that comes with the drug and includes efficacy data such as ORR. 16. Prior to 2015, there were no approved drugs to treat T790M-positive NSCLC patients. However, concurrently with Roci™s development, another company was developing its own drug, referred to herein as DRUG X, to treat the same group of patients. The development of Roci and DRUG X was a race, with analysts and investors carefully comparing Roci™s published efficacy data with DRUG X™s published efficacy data to determine which drug might capture more market share once approved by the FDA. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 15 6  Clovis Tells Investors That Roci™s Efficacy is 60%  17. Clovis disclosed to investors in early 2015 that it expected to submit its NDA to the FDA for Roci in mid-2015. In advance of the NDA submission, Clovis told investors it would give a preview of its label at the ASCO conference in May 2015. The data presentation at ASCO was also a necessary step to raising capital from investors that Clovis needed. 18. At an investor meeting at the ASCO conference on May 31, 2015, Clovis disclosed findings from Phase 2 of TIGER-X, publicly announcing that Clovis™ ﬁrecommendedﬂ or ﬁgo-forwardﬂ dose of Roci would be 500mg and that, at the 500mg dose, Roci™s ORR was 60%. Mahaffy stated that the data ﬁconfirm [Roci™s] compelling activityﬂ and would ﬁform the [NDA submission] in July [2015].ﬂ In its ASCO 2015 presentation, the company developing DRUG X disclosed that its current confirmed ORR was 63%. 19. The disclosed Roci ORR presented at ASCO 2015 and referenced throughout the relevant time period by Clovis was ﬁunconfirmed,ﬂ meaning that the initial tumor shrinkage was not necessarily sustained through a follow-up scan. Clovis™ 60% ORR at ASCO included patients who had a single responsive scan, but then progressed (e.g., their target tumors grew or they developed new tumors) without a confirmatory scan. In other words, Clovis™ 60% ORR at ASCO included some patients who could never be confirmed responders; some patients who had a responsive scan, but had not yet progressed; and some patients who had not had the opportunity for a second responsive scan because they had not been on study long enough. Later analysis of the ASCO data set showed that the confirmed ORR for the ASCO data set at the time it was presented was 40%. 20. In the spring of 2015, Clovis statisticians provided Roci ORR data to Clovis senior clinical personnel showing a divergence between the confirmed and unconfirmed ORR. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 15 7  Although Mahaffy, Mast and some other individuals at Clovis hoped that the FDA would allow Clovis to use Roci™s unconfirmed ORR on Roci™s label, certain senior Clovis employees believed that the FDA would require Clovis to follow RECIST and its own trial protocols in reporting a confirmed ORR on Roci™s label. Clovis Gets Initial NDA Data Showing Lower ORR, But Still Refers to the ASCO 2015 60% ORR In Connection With Raising $298 Million in the Offering  21. On June 19, 2015, Mahaffy and other members of Clovis senior management, not including Mast, received the ﬁclose to finalﬂ TIGER-X data which would be used for the NDA. The unconfirmed ORR was 45.1% for the 500mg dose, or 25% lower than the 60% ORR presented at the ASCO 2015 conference. Mahaffy at the time wrote to a Clovis executive that the data ﬁ[s]eem[ed] worrying.ﬂ 22. After receiving the ﬁclose to finalﬂ TIGER-X data, Clovis prepared drafts of a Prospectus Supplement for filing with the SEC and a roadshow presentation for use in soliciting potential investors in connection with the Offering. Both the Prospectus Supplement and the roadshow presentation referenced that Clovis had presented TIGER-X data showing a 60% ORR at ASCO 2015, but without disclosing that the data was unconfirmed. And in the case of the Prospectus Supplement, Clovis stated that TIGER-X data, combined with data from the ongoing TIGER-2 trial (which had patients on the 625mg dose), would ﬁform the basisﬂ of the forthcoming NDA submission in late July 2015, without disclosing that Roci™s NDA ORR for the 500mg dose was lower than 60%. 23. On July 7, 2015, the day before the Offering, Clovis management, including Mahaffy and Mast, received the ﬁfinalﬂ data to be included in Roci™s initial NDA submission to the FDA. The data showed that Roci™s unconfirmed ORR was 42% for the 500mg dose. The data also showed that Roci™s confirmed ORR was only 31% for the 500mg dose, less than 50% Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 15 8  of DRUG X™s confirmed ORR presented at ASCO. Later that same day, Mahaffy, Mast, and Clovis™ most senior clinical executives conducted an internal conference call to discuss the data. 24. The defendants hoped, based on experience with prior Roci data sets, but did not know to any degree of certainty, that Roci™s ORR would increase by the time of a planned 90- day efficacy update to the initial NDA submission. However, rather than disclose the current Roci ORR and Clovis™ hope that it would increase, Mahaffy and Mast formally approved, in writing, the filing of the Prospectus Supplement with the SEC and the use of the roadshow presentation that both referenced the ASCO 2015 60% ORR. The Prospectus Supplement and the roadshow presentation omitted to disclose material facts necessary to make the reference to the ASCO 2015 data not misleading, including Roci™s current unconfirmed and confirmed ORR. These documents gave investors the false impression that Roci™s ORR continued to be 60%. 25. The following day, on July 8, 2015, Mahaffy led and Mast participated in multiple investor roadshow conference calls without disclosing Roci™s current unconfirmed or confirmed ORR.  During the conference calls Mahaffy described Roci and DRUG X as similarly efficacious. 26. Clovis raised approximately $298 million (net) in connection with the Offering.  Not disclosing the current unconfirmed or confirmed ORR data inflated Clovis™ stock price and enabled Clovis to receive substantial ill-gotten gains from the Offering. Roci™s ORR is Capped, But Clovis Continues to Reference the 60% Number from ASCO  27. On or about July 28, 2015, Clovis™ lead statistician told Clovis™ lead clinician that the confirmed ORR in the NDA would improve only slightly by the time of the planned 90-day efficacy update, if at all. The lead statistician also told the lead clinician, as well as Mahaffy, that the unconfirmed ORR might increase to 46% by the time of the planned 90-day efficacy Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 15 9  update. Mahaffy therefore should have known that Roci™s unconfirmed ORR would not be more than 46% at the time of the 90-day efficacy update. 28. On August 6, 2015, Clovis issued a press release announcing its second-quarter 2015 earnings. Mahaffy and Mast reviewed and approved the issuance of the press release and the accompanying earnings call script. The press release was also furnished to the Commission on Form 8-K and signed by Mast. 29. The press release stated that Clovis had filed its initial NDA on July 30, 2015, and also summarized the data presented at the ASCO 2015 conference, again citing the 60% ORR figure (without disclosing it was unconfirmed) and again stating that the TIGER-X and TIGER-2 data formed the basis of Clovis™ NDA for Roci. During the accompanying investor conference call on August 6, 2015, Mahaffy told investors that Clovis had ﬁpresented a full update of our data set at ASCO,ﬂ giving the false impression that the ASCO 2015 data was consistent with the NDA data. Similarly, Mahaffy further stated on the August 6 investor call that, ﬁ[t]he primary dose we are seeking approval for is 500[mg], and that all comes from TIGER-X and the data you saw at ASCO.ﬂ In describing the data submitted in the NDA, Mahaffy further claimed that the ﬁdata sets have continued to demonstrate compelling and consistent activity.ﬂ 30. In approximately September 2015, another biopharmaceutical company (ﬁCompany Yﬂ) conducted due diligence, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, as to Roci in connection with a potential acquisition of Clovis. When Company Y learned during the due diligence of the undisclosed ORR data concerning Roci Œ the same data that Clovis submitted to the FDA in its NDA Œ it withdrew from the potential acquisition of Clovis. The defendants knew or should have known that Company Y™s view was that Roci would not be competitive with DRUG X. Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 15 10  31. The 90-day efficacy update for Roci, submitted to the FDA on October 22, 2015, showed confirmed ORR of 33% and unconfirmed ORR of 46% for the 500mg dose. The 90-day efficacy update data was shared and discussed with Mahaffy and Mast before it was submitted to the FDA. 32. On November 5, 2015, after submitting the 90-day efficacy update, Clovis issued a press release announcing its third-quarter 2015 earnings. Mahaffy and Mast reviewed and approved the issuance of the press release and the accompanying earnings call script. The press release was also furnished to the Commission on Form 8-K and signed by Mast. 33. In the press release and on the accompanying earnings conference call led by Mahaffy, Clovis highlighted medical presentations of Roci data that occurred during the third quarter and directed investors to review the presentations on Clovis™ website. These medical presentations again highlighted the ASCO 2015 data and the 60% ORR at the 500mg dose, without disclosing that the data was unconfirmed, or disclosing the lower ORR data submitted in the initial NDA submission, or disclosing the lower ORR data submitted to the FDA in connection with the 90-day efficacy update. Clovis™ Disclosures Misled Investors  34. Clovis™ references during the relevant time period to the ASCO presentation and its highlighting of the 60% ORR figure for the 500mg dose were misleading because the data submitted to the FDA showed response rates far below 60% for that dose, on either a confirmed or unconfirmed basis. Investors fairly understood that the ORR in the NDA submission, and the eventual Roci label, would be substantially similar to the 60% ASCO figure, when in fact the undisclosed data Œ which Clovis provided to the FDA Œ showed ORR ranging between 31% (confirmed) and 46% (unconfirmed). Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 15 11  35. Further, investors believed that the 60% ORR was ﬁconfirmed.ﬂ Presenting an ORR comprised of only confirmed responses was customary, and therefore investors would have expected Clovis to disclose if it was deviating from customary practice and its own clinical trial protocols by presenting unconfirmed ORR. Indeed, even a Clovis employee involved with medical publications believed that the ASCO 60% ORR represented a confirmed response rate. 36. The continued use of the 60% ORR figure, without disclosing that it was unconfirmed, and without disclosing that the data submitted to the FDA showed responses rates far below 60%, on either a confirmed or unconfirmed basis, led investors to the false conclusion that Roci and DRUG X had similar efficacy and therefore that Roci would be competitive in the marketplace. As late as November 6, 2015, analysts continued to cite Roci™s ﬁ60% response rateﬂ in concluding that Roci™s efficacy was ﬁvery similarﬂ to DRUG X. Clovis™ Subsequent Disclosure of Roci™s Confirmed ORR  37. On Friday, November 6, 2015, the FDA sent a memorandum to Clovis in advance of a planned conference call on November 9, 2015, referred to as the ﬁMid-Cycle Communication.ﬂ In the memorandum and conference call on November 9, 2015, the FDA informed Clovis that its seeking approval for Roci on the basis of unconfirmed data that deviated from RECIST was unacceptable, and that the accurately calculated confirmed ORR may not be of sufficient magnitude to predict clinical benefit. Mahaffy and Mast both received the FDA™s November 6, 2015 memorandum, and were informed following the November 9, 2015 conference call that the FDA would not change its position that Clovis must use confirmed ORR. 38. On November 10, 2015, Mast was scheduled to attend an investor conference that Mahaffy was originally scheduled to attend. Mahaffy and Mast spoke prior to the conference, and they decided together that Mast would still attend the conference. During the conference, Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 15 12  Mast spoke from a deck of slides that was displayed overhead for investors to see and also posted to Clovis™ website. Even though Mahaffy and Mast knew or should have known that the FDA would require confirmed ORR, one of the slides included the ASCO 2015 60% ORR for the 500mg dose, but without disclosing that fact or the accurate ORR. 39. On November 16, 2015, Clovis disclosed that Roci™s confirmed ORR for the NDA dataset was only 28%. When Clovis disclosed the true ORR, analysts reported that they were ﬁshockedﬂ and ﬁblindsided.ﬂ Analysts also concluded that Roci™s ORR was now ﬁmeaningfully lowerﬂ than DRUG X and, accordingly, ﬁreduced its competitiveness substantially.ﬂ As a result, on November 16, 2015, Clovis™ stock price closed down approximately 70%, or $69.19 per share (from a closing price of $99.43 per share on Friday, November 13, 2015 to a closing price of $30.24 per share on November 16). By May 2016, after receiving further feedback from the FDA, Clovis had ceased development of Roci and terminated enrollment in all Clovis-sponsored clinical studies of Roci.

Miller  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Denver Regional Office 1961 Stout Street, Suite 1700 Denver, CO 80294 (303) 844-1000  Attorneys for Plaintiff Case 1:18-cv-02381   Document 1   Filed 09/18/18   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 15","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Boulder, Colorado-based biopharmaceutical company, its CEO and its former CFO will pay more than $20 million in penalties to settle charges of misleading investors about the company's developmental lung cancer drug.The SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Denver alleges that over a four-month period starting in July 2015, Clovis Oncology Inc. and CEO Patrick Mahaffy misled investors about how well Clovis' flagship lung cancer drug worked compared to another drug. According to the complaint, the company's investor presentations, press releases, and SEC filings stated that the drug was effective 60 percent of the time, far higher than suggested by actual results available internally. Clovis raised approximately $298 million in a public stock offering in July 2015, and saw its stock price collapse in November 2015 after disclosing that the effectiveness rate was actually 28 percent. The company stopped development on the drug in May 2016.According to the SEC's complaint, in evaluating Clovis' stock, investors closely followed prospects for its lung cancer drug rociletinib, or Roci, and an important driver was its ""efficacy,"" or how well the drug worked. In May 2015, Clovis disclosed in an investor presentation that Roci's efficacy was 60 percent, meaning that in 60 percent of patients, Roci caused targeted tumors to shrink. The complaint alleges that soon after, certain data provided to Mahaffy and Erle Mast, the company's CFO at that time, showed that Roci's efficacy rate was substantially lower and by early July 2015, Mahaffy and Mast learned that the efficacy for Roci at that time was 42 percent. Clovis continued referring to the 60 percent efficacy figure, including in the solicitation materials for the July 2015 offering and afterward.

50,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ATLANTA DIVISION    SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,    v.  Case No.  SUDHAKAR REDDY BONTHU,   Defendant.  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED      COMPLAINT  Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), files its complaint and alleges that: SUMMARY  1. Defendant Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu (ﬁBonthuﬂ) committed securities fraud by engaging in illegal insider trading in the securities of Equifax Inc. (ﬁEquifaxﬂ or ﬁthe companyﬂ).  Bonthu was an Equifax employee from September 2003 until March 2018. 2. In late August 2017, after being entrusted by his employer with material nonpublic information about a massive cyber-intrusion and data breach purportedly Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 1 of 12 2  suffered by an unnamed client of the company, Bonthu deduced that Equifax was itself the victim of the breach.  Bonthu then traded against the company by purchasing risky put option contracts in Equifax common stock. 3. On September 8, 2017, the day after Equifax publicly announced that it had suffered a massive breach, Bonthu sold all of his Equifax put options for total net proceeds of more than $75,000. 4. By the conduct detailed in this Complaint, Bonthu violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.  Unless enjoined, Bonthu is likely to commit such violations again in the future. 5. The Commission seeks a judgment from the Court: (a) enjoining Bonthu from engaging in future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; and (b) ordering Bonthu to disgorge an amount equal to his ill-gotten gains resulting from the actions described herein, with prejudgment interest. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. 7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), 21A and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78u-1, and 78aa]. Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 2 of 12 3  8. Bonthu, directly or indirectly, used the means or instruments of interstate commerce, the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts described herein. 9. Venue is proper under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] and 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims made herein occurred in the Northern District of Georgia.  In addition, Bonthu currently resides in the Northern District of Georgia. DEFENDANT 10. Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, age 44, is a resident of Cumming, Georgia.  Bonthu is a citizen of India and a permanent resident of the United States.  He was an employee of Equifax from September 2003 until March 2018.  Beginning in September 2013, he was a Production Development Manager of Software Engineering in Equifax™s Global Consumer Solutions (ﬁGCSﬂ) business unit.  On March 12, 2018, his employment was terminated by Equifax.  Bonthu is currently unemployed.  RELEVANT ENTITY 11. Equifax Inc., an information solutions and human resources company, is a Georgia corporation headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.  Equifax™s common stock Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 3 of 12 4  trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ﬁEFX.ﬂ  Equifax is one of three major consumer credit bureaus. STATEMENT OF FACTS I. THE EQUIFAX CYBERSECURITY BREACH 12. On July 29, 2017, Equifax™s security department observed suspicious network traffic within an internal system.  Over the next several weeks, it was determined that Equifax had been subject to cyber-intrusions that resulted in a breach of Equifax™s information technology (ﬁITﬂ) systems. 13. A crisis action team consisting of Equifax security, IT, and legal personnel was formed and began working to analyze forensic data and determine the scope of the intrusion.  The analysis suggested it was likely that sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (ﬁPIIﬂ) for millions of consumers, had been stolen. 14. Equifax established a notification and remediation plan for the millions of consumers affected by the breach.  The company designated this effort as ﬁProject Sparta.ﬂ 15. Although the crisis action team members were aware that Equifax had been breached, the company made attempts to keep that information confidential from others.  To limit the number of people who knew that Equifax itself had been Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 4 of 12 5  breached, the Equifax employees who were part of Project Sparta were told that they were working for an unnamed potential client that had experienced a large data breach. 16. Project Sparta was handled largely through the company™s GCS unit, which developed and sold various personal security and identity theft defense products and services to clients. II. BONTHU IS ENTRUSTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE BREACH  17. On August 25, 2017, Bonthu, a software product development manager working in GCS, was assigned to work on a ﬁfast-breaking opportunityﬂ for an unnamed potential client as a part of Project Sparta. 18. Bonthu was told that the project was a high priority for the unnamed company and had a short deadline because the client intended to ﬁgo liveﬂ on September 6, 2017, with the breach remediation applications designed by Equifax. 19. Bonthu was tasked with primary responsibility for developing an online user interface into which consumers could input information to determine whether they had been impacted by the breach.  Bonthu was also responsible for creating an algorithm that would schedule consumers to return to Equifax™s website to register for identity protection tools.   Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 5 of 12 6  20. Between August 25 and August 31, 2017, in connection with his work on Project Sparta, Bonthu received emails and participated in conversations that informed him that the breach impacted at least 100 million consumers Œ the largest breach opportunity Equifax ever had handled. 21. In the course of his work, Bonthu also used test datasets that contained the same types of PII that had been impacted by the breach, including first and last names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and social security numbers. 22. On August 31, 2017, Bonthu was copied on an email that attached a test dataset file that was named ﬁEFXDatabreach.postman_collection.ﬂ III. BONTHU CONCLUDES THAT EQUIFAX WAS THE REAL VICTIM OF THE BREACH  23. By no later than August 31, 2017, based on material nonpublic information entrusted to him by his employer, Equifax, Bonthu had concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach, despite the statements made as part of Project Sparta asserting that it was a business opportunity for an unnamed client. 24. Bonthu owed a duty of trust and confidence to Equifax and its shareholders not to trade on the basis of material nonpublic information that he learned through his employment with Equifax, and was aware of his duty. Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 6 of 12 7  25. Bonthu knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was material.  26. Bonthu knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was nonpublic.  IV. BONTHU™S TRADING IN EQUIFAX SECURITIES 27. On September 1, 2017, Bonthu accessed his family™s brokerage accounts on their broker™s website.   28. Bonthu had access to numerous family brokerage accounts, several of which were held in his own name and had cash available for new transactions. 29. From the available accounts, however, Bonthu chose an account held solely in his wife™s name. 30. In his wife™s account, Bonthu purchased eighty-six out-of-the-money put option contracts for shares of Equifax common stock with an expiration date of September 15, 2017, and a strike price of $130 per share.  Bonthu made this purchase despite the fact that Equifax™s policies expressly prohibit any trading in derivative securities, including put and call options. 31. By purchasing out-of-the-money put options, Bonthu could make money only if the market price of Equifax stock were to drop below the put option strike price before the contract expired approximately two weeks later, on September 15.  Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 7 of 12 8  If the market price did not so drop, the put options would expire and his investment would be worthless. 32. The strike price of $130 per share was more than $10 below the price at which Equifax common stock traded on that day. 33. The total price of the Equifax option contracts purchased by Bonthu on September 1 was $2,166.11. 34. Bonthu had never previously traded in Equifax options.   V. EQUIFAX TELLS THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE BREACH, AND BONTHU SELLS HIS PUT OPTIONS  35. After the close of the market on September 7, 2017, Equifax issued a press release and filed a Form 8-K with the Commission, announcing the cybersecurity breach and revealing that it potentially impacted approximately 143 million consumers in the United States. 36. The breach was one of the leading news stories over the next several days and was described as ﬁone of the worst [data breaches] ever, by its reach and by the kind of information exposed to the public.ﬂ 37. On September 8, the price of Equifax common stock closed at $123.23, a drop of $19.49 (nearly 14%) per share from the prior day™s closing price of $142.72.  Trading volume that day also increased dramatically to nearly seventeen Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 8 of 12 9  million shares, more than a thirty-fold increase from the previous day™s volume of approximately 518,000 shares. 38. Also on the morning of September 8, and despite Equifax™s policies expressly forbidding transactions in derivative securities, Bonthu sold all of his Equifax put option contracts.  As a result of the precipitous drop in Equifax™s share price, Bonthu turned his initial investment of $2,166.11 into $77,333.79 in only six days.  In sum, Bonthu™s ill-gotten gains from his trading in Equifax options totaled $75,167.68, a return of more than 3,500% on his initial investment.   39. Bonthu™s securities transactions were made on the basis of material nonpublic information and breached the duty of trust and confidence that he owed to Equifax and its shareholders.  Bonthu knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was material and nonpublic, and Bonthu used that information when making these securities transactions.   40. Bonthu™s trading on the basis of material nonpublic information entrusted to him by Equifax was deceptive and fraudulent. Case 1:18-cv-03114-MLB   Document 1   Filed 06/28/18   Page 9 of 12 10  VI. EQUIFAX TERMINATES BONTHU™S EMPLOYMENT 41. On March 12, 2018, following Bonthu™s refusal to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company™s insider trading policy, Bonthu™s employment at Equifax was terminated. COUNT I Œ INSIDER TRADING IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SECURITIES  Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]  42. The Commission realleges and reincorporates paragraphs 1 through 41 as if fully set forth herein. 43. Bonthu, with scienter, by use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities: (a) employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud; (b) made untrue statements of material fact or omissions to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and/or (c) engaged in acts, practices or courses of business which operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit. 44.

This is the second case the SEC has filed arising from the Equifax data breach. In March, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s U.S. business unit was charged with insider trading.In a complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, the SEC charged that Equifax software engineering manager Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu traded on confidential information he received while creating a website for consumers impacted by a data breach.According to the complaint, Bonthu was told the work was being done for an unnamed potential client, but based on information he received, he concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of the breach. The SEC alleges that Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on the non-public information by purchasing Equifax put options. Less than a week later, after Equifax publicly announced the data breach and its stock declined nearly 14 percent, Bonthu sold the put options and netted more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 percent on his initial investment.Bonthu, 44, was terminated from Equifax in March after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he had violated the company’s insider trading policy.In a parallel proceeding, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia filed criminal charges against Bonthu.To settle the SEC’s civil charges, Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Skola and Justin Jeffries. The litigation is being led by Shawn Murnahan and Graham Loomis.

Thatfirm's status as a limited liability company in Georgia was terminated on March29, 2016, and its registration with the Commission was withdrawn on March 30,2016.THE FRAUDULENT SCHEMEA. Relevant Disclosures to Investors Concerning the Permissible Use ofInvestor Funds15. Between January 2015 and July 2015, three high net-worthindividuals and one institutional investor invested $2.4 million into SpecterVentures Fund. Each investor was provided with a subscription agreement andprivate placement agreement (""PPM"") that was drafted primarily based uponinformation provided by Batchelor.16. The offering materials for Specter Ventures Fund and otherinformation provided to investors represented that investor funds would be used toinvest in various businesses related to national security, as well as thedevelopment of a high performance submarine vessel.DCase 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 6 of 20  17. In addition to describing Specter Ventures Fund's investmentobjectives, the PPM noted that Specter Ventures Manager would receive a 2%yearly fee, based on the net assets of Specter Ventures Fund, as well as 20% of thefund's gains.18. The PPM also noted that Specter Ventures Fund would pay expensesdirectly related to Specter Ventures Manager's operation of the fund, including,among other categories, operating, research, administrative, travel and marketingexpenses.19.

Specter Ventures Fund Files a Form D Containing False and MateriallyMisleading Statements21. On March 2, 2015, Specter Ventures Fund filed a Form D with theCommission, to report its reliance on the exemption from the securitiesregistration provisions provided by Rule 506(b) of Regulation D.22. Batchelor provided all of the information that was incorporated intothe Form D.23. The Form D contained several false and misleading statements.24.

Second, the Form D failed to disclose that substantial amounts ofinvestor funds had already been moved to Batchelor's personal bank accounts andspent on personal goods and services. Instead, the Form D falsely stated that thatno amount of the gross proceeds from the offering were used as payments toBatchelor or others associated with Specter Ventures Fund.26. After filing, the Form D was provided to prospective investors in theSpecter Ventures Fund.C. Batchelor's Misappropriation of Investor Funds27.

Batchelor also made check card purchases that were personal innature, including more than $2,000 at Brooks Brothers, and more than $3,000 at aretailer that carries leather handbags and goods.D. Batchelor Belatedly Mischaracterizes the Misappropriated Funds as a""Loan""31. In November 2015, Batchelor caused Specter Ventures Manager tosend a letter to investors that misrepresented his use of investors' funds as a loan.32. The letter specifically stated that an entity owned and controlled byBatchelor and an associate had ""borrowed"" $2.4 million from investors inFebruary 2015.33. All information and supporting documentation concerning thepurported loan was provided by Batchelor to outside counsel for Specter VenturesFund, who then drafted the letter to be sent to investors.34. The purported loan document was fabricated by Batchelor in anattempt to justify and conceal his earlier fraud.10Case 1:18-mi-99999-UNA Document 432 Filed 02/13/18 Page 10 of 20  COUNTIŠFRAUDViolations of Sections 17(a)(1) of the Securities ActX15 U.S.C. ~ 77q(a)(1)135.

3,"1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA SAVANNAH DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, Civil Action File No. v.        _______________ JARED GABRIEL FORRESTER, Defendant. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF The plaintiff, the Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint and alleges the following: SUMMARY 1.Between at least December 2013 and February 2016, Defendant Jared GabrielForrester (ﬁForresterﬂ) was directly involved in a scheme by David R. Greenlee (ﬁGreenleeﬂ) and David A. Stewart, Jr. (ﬁStewartﬂ) that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors.   2.From 2013 through February 2016, Greenlee, Stewart, their principal salesman,Richard P. Underwood (ﬁUnderwoodﬂ), and other salesmen whom Greenlee and Stewart recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold interests in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 1 of 14   2 3.   In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to (a) acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in various oil wells and (b) employ enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells.  Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood also told investors that the entities would sell the oil in order to earn for investors returns ranging from 15 to 55 percent, or more, per year ﬁfor decades.ﬂ 4. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through two Tennessee corporations, Southern Energy Group, Inc. (ﬁSEGﬂ), which is now administratively dissolved, and Black Gold Resources, Inc. (ﬁBGRﬂ), which later changed its name to Tennstar Energy, Inc. (ﬁTennstarﬂ). 5. Greenlee, Stewart, and Underwood represented to investors that SEG would manage the limited partnerships and Tennstar would manage the joint ventures, and that each of these companies would be headed by an individual with meaningful experience in the oil industry. 6. Greenlee and Stewart installed figurehead executives for SEG and Tennstar who pretended to run the companies so that Greenlee and StewartŠboth convicted felonsŠcould conceal their own involvement in the scheme. 7. Forrester was the figurehead installed over Tennstar, and he knew that he was falsely portrayed to investors as both running the company and experienced in the oil industry. VIOLATIONS 8. Forrester, by virtue of his conduct, engaged in direct violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5].   Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 2 of 14   3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), (c) and (d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b)-(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)-(e)] to enjoin Forrester from engaging in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar purport and object, for disgorgement of illegally obtained funds, prejudgment interest and other equitable relief, and for civil money penalties. 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. 11. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, has made use of the mails and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint. 12. Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business constituting violations of the Securities Act and Exchange Act have occurred within the Southern District of Georgia.   DEFENDANT  13. Forrester, 35 and a resident of Summer Shade, Kentucky, was the purported President and CEO of Tennstar between December 2013 and February 2016, when the fraud was halted by the US Secret Service.  He was selected by Greenlee and Stewart to be Tennstar™s figurehead because he was known to both of them from their mutual involvement in an earlier, unrelated investment scheme.  Forrester previously worked as a hotel clerk, furniture store Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 3 of 14   4 salesman, and stock broker trainee at a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser that is unrelated to Tennstar or SEG.  Forrester currently works as a roofer.  In August 2016, the Tennessee Securities Division issued a cease-and-desist order against Tennstar and Forrester, finding that both made material misrepresentations to investors regarding the profitability of Tennstar investments. OTHER RELEVANT PEOPLE AND ENTITY 13. David R. Greenlee, age 42, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was convicted in state court and served time in a Kentucky prison during 1999 to 2000 for forgery and burglary, and again in 2004 for vehicular manslaughter. 14. David A. Stewart, Jr., age 46, and a resident of Gallatin, Tennessee, was a registered representative with two Commission-registered broker-dealers in 2001 and 2002.  In April 2007, Stewart was convicted of federal income tax evasion and sentenced to federal prison.  Later, in 2008, the Alabama Securities Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against Stewart, among others, for previously participating in a separate oil and gas offering scheme.  15.  Tennstar was a Tennessee corporation and the purported managing general partner of at least seven well-drilling joint ventures sold to investors.  Tennstar was dissolved by the State of Tennessee in August 2017 for failure to meet registration renewal requirements.  It never registered any stock or offerings with the Commission. 16. On August 11, 2017, the Commission filed a complaint in SEC v. Tennstar Energy, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:17-cv-00151 (S.D. Ga.), alleging violation of the antifraud statutes of the federal securities laws by Tennstar, Greenlee, Stewart and Underwood.    Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 4 of 14   5 FACTS A. Background  17. Between at least January 2013 and February 2016, Greenlee and Stewart, acting individually and through a network of salesmen whom they recruited and controlled, fraudulently sold to more than 150 investors at least $15 million of interests, called ﬁunits,ﬂ in various limited partnerships and joint ventures that were purportedly created to extract and sell oil from existing wells in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 18. Specifically, as described in the SEG and Tennstar offering materials and the corresponding certificates of ownership given to investors, individuals investing funds in the projects were buying fractional undivided working interests, which in turn provided net revenue interests for any profits derived from the purported plans to sell oil recovered from the wells at issue.   19. For example, the offering materials for Tennstar™s joint ventures explained: ﬁThe fraction thus obtained will represent the fractional interest of each such Venturer in the costs and revenues, if any, of the [Tennstar project].ﬂ  SEG offering materials used similar language regarding the interests sold through SEG™s partnerships. 20. Greenlee and Stewart operated their scheme through SEG for the limited partnerships and Tennstar for the joint ventures. 21. Each company was purportedly run by an individual experienced in the oil industry. 22. In soliciting investors, Greenlee, Stewart and their sales teams represented that the limited partnerships and joint ventures would use investor funds to acquire ﬁworking interestsﬂ in various oil wells, employ techniques, such as fracking, to develop and recover oil from the wells, Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 5 of 14   6 and sell the oil to earn investors returnsŠin the form of revenue interestsŠranging from 15 to 55 percent or more per year, which they said would last for decades. 23. In fact, while Greenlee and Stewart used some investor money at several wells to create an appearance of activity to dupe investors who wanted to see the wells in production, they used nearly two-thirds of the $15 million raised for their own benefit or to pay the costs of conducting the fraud, such as radio and internet advertising. 24. Given their criminal backgrounds, Greenlee and Stewart used fake names when soliciting investors to conceal their involvement in the scheme. B. Forrester Directly Violated the Antifraud Provisions of the Securities Laws  25. Forrester was the figurehead installed by Greenlee and Stewart to run Tennstar. 26. Forrester was portrayed to investors as running Tennstar when, in reality, that entity was controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.  27. Forrester incorporated the company at their request using $18,000 they provided, listed himself as Tennstar™s registered agent, and opened the entity™s offices in Tennessee and South Florida to house its boiler-room sales staff. 28. When investors ultimately provided their money to Tennstar, Forrester followed instructions from Greenlee and Stewart regarding how much to pay to the sales team, how much to spend on advertising, and how much to funnel to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart for personal misappropriationŠnone of which was disclosed to investors as anticipated use of their funds. 29. In addition to allowing himself to be portrayed falsely as running the company, Forrester was also active in the offer and sale of investments in Tennstar™s offerings.  In fact, he was the Tennstar employee who typically was listed on shipping labels as the sender of offering Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 6 of 14   7 materials via mail or common carrier to investors, knowing that those materials included a fake biography of himself.   For example, in July 2015, Forrester sent by common carrier a package of Tennstar offering materials to a Southern District of Georgia resident in Savannah, Georgia.  The materials included the false biography of Forrester.  The Southern District of Georgia resident ultimately invested $28,000 in a Tennstar offering, but never received any profits or distributions from the investment. 30. That fake biography claimed that Forrester, who was 29 years old when his role in the Tennstar fraud began, ﬁhad a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the yearsﬂ and had been ﬁpart of the 30+ years of [oil] field projects that his family ha[d] developed.ﬂ  The biography, written chiefly by Stewart and approved by Forrester, then asserted that Forrester™s experience had given him ﬁground-level field development expertise in the oil patchﬂ and ﬁan immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits.ﬂ   31. None of this was true since, prior to his figurehead role at Tennstar, Forrester had never worked in any legitimate oil drilling or production effort, nor had Forrester™s family members ever been involved in ﬁ30+ years of [oil] field projects.ﬂ 32. Forrester knew Greenlee and Stewart were using fake names when soliciting investors, and he touted his own fake industry experience in verbal solicitations of investors.   33. For instance, in an audio file created by Tennstar in what appears to have been an effort to coach and train its salesmen, Forrester was recorded on a telephone call soliciting a prospective investor to purchase an interest in a Tennstar joint venture.  During the call, Forrester told the prospective investor that Forrester had been in the oil business almost all of his life, claiming at one point during the call that he had worked in the industry since he was ﬁin diapers.ﬂ   Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 7 of 14   8 34. Additionally, when soliciting investors, Forrester used call scripts provided by Greenlee and Stewart for the boiler-room sales teams, claiming falsely that investments in Tennstar™s joint ventures were low risk and profitable.  Forrester knew such claims were false because, among other things, as head of Tennstar he signed and distributed investor distribution checks and knew most investors were receiving little, if any, return on their invested funds. 35. For instance, in July 2014, Forrester solicited and sold a Tennstar joint interest investment to a male investor, then a 50 year-old Florida resident.   36. The Florida investor initially had contacted SEGŠthe other fraudulent entity controlled by Greenlee and StewartŠafter hearing an SEG radio advertisement about oil investment opportunities.  In response to the Florida investor™s inquiry, Forrester called the Florida investor and, after asking about the Florida investor™s income, told him that his earnings were insufficient to invest in an SEG opportunity, but noted that the Florida investor could invest in a Tennstar joint venture instead.   37. In soliciting the Florida investor, Forrester falsely told the man that SEG and BGR were unrelated and that Forrester had ﬁworked his way up through the oil fieldsﬂ and had been in the oil industry ﬁhis whole adult life.ﬂ   38. When the Florida investor asked Forrester if the Tennstar offering wasŠin his wordsŠﬁon the up and up,ﬂ Forrester responded by telling him, as the Florida investor recalled:  ﬁI™m a man of God.  I love my family and my faith is most important to me.  And I™m not lying to you.ﬂ   39. After hearing this, the Florida investor told Forrester to send him further information on the offering, which Forrester did by sending him offering materials by common carrier that contained Forrester™s fake biography. Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 8 of 14   9 40. After receiving these materials, the Florida investor had another call with Forrester.  During this call, the Florida investor asked Forrester about the risks of a Tennstar investment.  Forrester responded by telling the Florida investor not to worry about risk because Forrester™s prior experience in the oil industry was alleviating that risk.   41. Forrester further told the Florida investor that he could receive a 30 percent return on his investment, adding, as the Florida investor recalled, that the ﬁoil flow is expected to last for decades, if not longer.ﬂ   42. Based on Forrester™s representations about the investment and his supposed industry experience, the Florida investor invested a total of $80,000 into two separate Tennstar joint venture offeringsŠan amount that the Florida investor described to Forrester as being almost all of his life savings.  The Florida investor, in making his investment decision, believed that Forrester™s purported experience would make the joint ventures successful. 43. Subsequently, in February 2015, Forrester told the Florida investor in letters that he signed as Tennstar™s President and CEO that the oil wells in which the Florida investor had invested had turned out to be dry.   44. Forrester assured the Florida investor that his investment would be moved to a different Tennstar joint venture but that no new paperwork was necessary.  Forrester further assured the Florida investor that the new joint venture was a ﬁsure thing.ﬂ   45. The Florida investor eventually received a few small distribution checks from Tennstar, totaling no more than $550.  He never received his promised return on his investment or any refund of his invested amount.  Case 4:18-cv-00283-RSB-JEG   Document 1   Filed 11/30/18   Page 9 of 14   10 46. During the fraud while under the purported direction of Forrester, Tennstar offered and sold to more than 90 investors at least $2.7 million of units in at least seven joint ventures.   47. Of these funds, Forrester paid himself at least $233,711.60. COUNT IŠFRAUD   Violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1)]  48.

He misled investors by failing to disclose that two convicted felons actually were running the company. Despite having no background in oil drilling or production efforts, Tennstar's website allegedly described Forrester as having ""an immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits."" Tennstar offering materials also allegedly claimed that Forrester ""had a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the years."" The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had ""worked his way up through the oil fields"" and had been in the industry during his ""whole adult life."" However, Forrester's work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee.Last year, the SEC charged David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use. In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme. For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian M. Basinger, Stephen E. Donahue, and Edward G. Sullivan of the Atlanta office.

During. tl~e Relevant Period, Rashid was a Partner and later a Senior Partner atApollo Mallageinent, L.P. {""A~ollo""), a multi-billion dollar investment adviser registered withthe Commission. Rashid provided investment advice to at least five private equity fundsmanaged by Apollo affiliates, As ilrvestment advisers, Apollo and Rashid owed fiduciary dutiesCase 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 1 of 28 to the client funds that they advised. At all times, they were required to act in their clients' bestinterests end owed (hose clients a duty of undivided loyalty and utmost good faith.~. During the Relevant Period, Rashid received millions of dollars each year relatedto his advisory ser~~ices as an Apollo partner. Nevertheless, by at least ?010, Rashid beganmisappropriating the private equity funds' money by submitting false expense reports to obtainreimbursement for claimed business expenses Yhat were, in fact, his personal expenses, inviolation of both Rashid's and Apollo's fiduciary duties to these funds.4. Over the Relevant Period, Rashid fraudulently charged more than one thousandpersonal items and services to the private equity funds that he advised. In 2010, for example,Rashid sought over ~ 1,100 in reimbursement from two private equity funds by falsely claimingthat the charbes were for business-related meals. In fact, Rashid sought the $1,100 to cover thecost of his visits to a hair salon. Later in 2010, Apollo discovered that Rashid charged these Šand other Špersonal expenses to the private equity funds that he advised, and required Rashid torepay these expenses. But Apollo took no specific steps to ensure that Rashid did not againmisappropriate their clients' funds.5. Despite Apollo's knowledge of Rashid's unlawful conduct, Rashid continued toimproperly charge person~~l expenses to the private equity fur7ds that he and Apollo advised. .Forexample, he charbeci expenses for several personal vacations to private equity funds that headvised, including intenlational vacations with his family for holidays acid trips to attend hisfriends' weddings.6. Rashid knew that 11is conduct was wrong, and lie took active steps to conceal it.In 2012, for example, after his administrative assistant questioned whether Rashid's $3,500chaz-ge at a high-end men's clothing store was business related, Rashid falsified a receipt toCase 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 2 of 28 justify the expense as business-related holiday gifts for executives of companies in which thefunds invested, when, in fact, Rashid had spent that money on a suit for his father.Apollo discovered Rashid's attempt to charge two of the private equity funds for'~~~, ~-ather's suit before it was charged to the funds, and required Rashid to repay that expense toApollo, along with other personal expenses that Rashid admitted he c}iarged to the funds headvised. Despite Apollo's additional discoveries, Rashid continued to charge thousands ofdollars of his personal expenses to funds he advised.8. After an extensive intenlal investigation into Rashid's expense issues andRashid's repayment of approximately $290,000 in personal expenses Rashid had charged toclients, Apollo entered into a separation agreement with Rashid effective February 2014.VIOLATIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT9.

Apollo has been registered with the Commissioi~7 as an investment adviser since2007. Along with certain of its affiliated advisers, Apollo manages more than .x,46 billion inassets.24. Since being registered as an investment adviser, Apollo has managed multipleprivate equity funds that invest in distressed or undervalued companies with the goal of laterexiting the investments for a profit. The companies in which Apollo's private equity fundsinvest are referred to as ""portfolio companies.""Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 7 of 28 25. During the Relevant Period, Rashid was an investment adviser to Apollo's privateequity funds. At the beginning of the Relevant Period, Rashid was a Partner at Apollo, and by2012, Apollo promoted him to Senior Partner. During the Relevant Period, Rashid was a~:r~ember of the private equity investment group and advised the Relevant Fuilds. Specifically,Rashid sourced, evaluated, and recommended investment opportunities to the Relevant Funds aswell as monitored the perfoi-marlce of investments made by the private equity funds and, whenappropriate, developed and recommended disposition strategies. He regularly participated inweekly meetings that took place amongst the investment professionals in the private equitygroup, where they discussed and determined, anlong other things, potential investments for theprivate equity funds ar~d the disposition of investments in those funds, including the RelevantFunds.2b. As described in a private placement memorandum for ANRP, for example,Apollo stated that Rashid `'leads [Apollo's] efforts in metals and mining and has helped generate,evaluate and execute a majority of [Apollo's] transactions in the sector.""27. Rashid further monitored the Relevant Funds' portfolio companies andimplemented plans to enhance their financial performance. He also conducted due diligence todetermine when and how the Relevant Funds could profitably liquidate or reduce theirŁ ownershipinterests in the portfolio companies they owned. Rashid served as a member of the boards ofdirectors of at least three publicly-traded portfolio companies. Rashid further acted as a principalpoint of contact between these portfolio coinpaliies' executives and the Relevant Funds.28. Rashid received compensation for providing investment advice to the RelevantFunds. He also received director fees for serving on the portfolio companies' boards ofdirectors. In total, Rashid received millions of dollars per year related to his advisory services8Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 8 of 28 with Apollo during the Relevant Period. Rashid hid an interest as a limited partner in the;eneral partlzers of Fund V, Fund VI, Fund VII, and ANRP, as we11 as equity interests in theRelevant Funds.29. As investTnent advisers, Rashid and Apollo had a fundamental obligation to act inthe best interests of their clients, to provide investment advice that was in their clients' bestinterests, and to exercise the utmost good faith in dealing with their clients.II. The Relevant Funds' Governing Documents and Apollo's Policies Prohibited RashidFrom Charging Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds30. The Relevant Funds' govenling documents permitted Apollo and Rashid tocharge expenses to the Relevant Funds only if the expenses related to the funds' investments andoperations. The govel-~1in~ documents dicl not permit Rashid or Apollo to charge personalexpenses to the Relevant Funds.31. Apollo's limited partnership agreement for ANRP, for example, stated that ANRPwas responsible only for operating expenses ""arising in connection with [ANRP's] operationsaild the acquisition, ownership, and maintenance of investments in the Portfolio Companies.""ANRP's limited partnership agreement did not permit Apollo to charge its employees' personalexpenses to the fund.32. Similarly, during the Relevant Period, Apollo's Travel and ExpenseReimbursement Policies and Procedures (""T&E Policies"") permitted its employees to chargetheir clients only with reasonable business and travel expenses incun-ed in the performance oftheir duties. It stated, ""Apollo will reimburse employees for business and travel expensesincurred while performing their duties, provided the expenses are necessary, reasonable andappropriately documented."" It further required employees to ""use best efforts to appropriately9Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 9 of 28 allocate the expensc,~' including using project codes to identify amounts that should be billed toApollo's funds' portfolio companies, investment funds, or other special projects.33. Apollo's T&E Policies fiirther stated that ""[e]thics, integrity, and efficiency arethe cornerstones of success for all professional service companies,"" and that ""[e]very employeewho incurs expenses on behalf of the Company has a fiduciary obligation Š to know, understandand adhere to the Company's Travel &Expense Reimbursement Policies and Procedures."" Itwarned that ""[a]ny attempt to knowingly submit a false claim will be treated as a seriousdisciplinary offense.""34. Apollo's T&E Policies further gave examples of ""Typical Non-ReimbursableT&E Items"" that included ""Barber/Beauty Shop or Spa charges,"" ""Clothing,"" ""Non-Business(e.g. personal) travel and entertainment expenses,"" ""Personal items,"" and ""spousal or othercompanion expenses."" Notwithstanding Apollo's T&E Policies, Rashid charged each of thesespecified, non-reimbursable items to the Relevant Funds.35. In addition, Apollo's Employee Handbook stated that employees maybereimbursed for ""reasonable business expenses at the discretion of the Company,"" and that""[e]x~ensing items that are not business related is a serious offense.""36. During the Relevant Period, Rashid signed annual certifications that he hadcompleted Apollo's compliance training that included training concerning Apollo's T&EPolicies. Rashid also signed Apollo's Code of Ethics, which stated, among other things, that""[t]he falsification of any book, record or account relating to the business of Apollo, its clients orto the disposition of assets of the Firm or its clients (including, without limitltion, t11e submissionof any false personal expense statement, claim for reimbursement of anon-business expense or afalse record or claim uiadcr an employee benefit plan) is prohibited.""10Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 10 of 28 37. Rashid knew, or was reckless in not lalowing, that the Relevant Funds' offeringdocuments, other governing documents, and Apollo's T&E Policies prohibited him fromcharging his personal expenses to the Relevant Funds. Rashid received documents regarding~~ polio's T&E Policies, attended mandatory training regarding such policies and procedures, andconfirmed ghat he understood such policies and procedures as an adviser with Apollo.III. Apollo's Business Expense Reimbursement Process38. Pursuant to Apollo's T&E Policies, Apollo gave employees such as Rashid acorporate credit card to pay for business-related expenses. Apollo's T&E Policies emphasizedthat ""Employees generally should NOT use their [corporate credit card] for personalexpenses.'' It further directed that ""[i]f for some reason you do need to charge a personalexpense on the [corporate credit card] ... ,you are required to remit payment directly"" to thecredit card company.39. To obtain reimbursement for claimed business expenses, Apollo's T&E Policiesrequired employees to submit expense reports each month to address the ""WHO, WHAT,WHEN WHERE and WHY"" of each business expense.40. Apollo's T&E Policies permitted employees to delegate expense reportpreparation to other individuals, such as an assistant, but noted that ""the employee is ultimatelyresponsible for timely and accurate submission of his/her expenses regardless of who preparesthe expense report."" In addition, for at least part of the Relevant Period, before submitting'- ~~~ expensereports; Apollo's T&~ policies required employees to certify that they (1) ""have read,understood and complied with [Apollo's T&E Policies]""; and (2) ""affrm that the reimbursableexpenses included in this expense report are valid business expenses.''11Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 11 of 28 4~1. Pursuant to t~lese policies, Apo110 gave Rashid a corporate credit card to pay forhis business expenses. The corporate credit card com~aany sent Apollo monthly bills containingRashid's charges. Apollo paid Rashid's bill directly, and then sent Rashid draft expense reports~~~>r Rashid to identify who should ultimately be responsible for each of Rashid's expenses and toprovide justifications for all business expenses.42. Apollo required Rashid to personally approve each monthly expense report beforesubmitting it to Apollo's expense manager for review and approval.43. Although Rashid's administrative assistants prepared the initial drafts of hisexpense reports, Rashid approved them and provided supporting details and instructionsconcerning how Apollo should bill the expenses. Rashid often provided verbal explanations tohis assistants when they had questions about particular expenses. He also highlighted andannotated draft expense reports to identify the business purpose and the client or entity thatshould pay for each expense, which his administrative assistants then finalized and submitted toApollo for final disposition in accordance wit1~1 Rashid's instructions.44. At least in 2010, Rashid also submitted affidavits ""to prove the legitimatebusiness purpose"" for claimed business expenses when he did not provide receipts. Even afterApollo no longer required employees to submit these affidavits, Rashid continued to review andapprove his expense reports before IZis assistants submitted them to Apo11o.45. AfterŁ Rashid or his administrative assistants submitted a final expense report to-' Apollo, 'Apollo would a1~~ocate Rashid's expenses to'the individual funds for which each expensetivas related as Rashid had indicated in his expense reports.12Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 12 of 28 46. Rashid knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Relevant Funds would becharged for any expense that he allocated to a Relevant Fund or one of its portfolio companies asa claimed business expense in his monthly expense reports.47. Apollo sent the Relevant Funds periodic (often quarterly) statements setting forth1Łeimbursement for Rashid's (arid other Apollo employees') claimed business expenses. TheRelevant Funds then reimbursed Apollo for Rashid's claimed business expenses via wiretra~lsfers.IV. During the Relevant Period, Rashid Fraudulently Charged Nearly $290,000 of HisPersonal Expenses to the Relevant Funds48. By no later than ?010, Rashid began fraudulently charging personal expenses tothe Relevant Funds in breach of the Relevant Funds' governing documents, Apollo's T&EPolicies, and his and Apollo's fiduciary duties to the Relevant Funds.49. Throughout the Relevant Pez7od, Rashid regularly charged personal expei~7ses tohis corporate credit card and then fraudulently claimed them. as business expenses on his monthlyexpense reports to Apollo. In most cases, Apollo then obtained reimbursement from theRelevant Funds for these expenses based ot~ Rashid's false representations that they werebusiness related.50. During the Relevant Period, Rashid misappropriated approximately X290,000 (ofwhich at least approximately $170,000 post-dated June 13, 20'11) from the Relevant ~'uizds byfalsely claiming that his personal expenses were legitimate business expenses. These expensescomprised hundreds of different charges including charges for personal travel, consumerelectronics and restaurant meals.A. In 2010, Rashid Admitted to Fraudulently Billing Certain Personal Expenses '~13Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 13 of 28 51. During 20'10, Rashid TŁegularly charged expenses related to personal groomingservices that he received at a high-end hair salon to his Apollo corporate credit card. Incompleting his expense reports, Rashid falsely claimed that this hair salon was a restaurant andthat more than X1,100 of expenses were business-related ""meals with management,"" sometimesidentifying specific executives he claimed to have taken to dinner. Based on Rashid's falserepresentations, certain of the Relevant Funds paid for personal hairŁ salon charges that Rashidclaimed were business expenses.52. In or around September 2010, Rashid's administrative assistant becamesuspicious of Rashid's explanations for these recurring expenses. After detez7nining that therewas no restaurant in New York with the name of the vendor on the credit card statement, but thata New York hair salon had that name, she reported her concerns to Apollo's expense manager.The expense manager escalated the matter to Apo11o's Chief Financial Officer (`'CFO""), whodecided to conduct a review of Rashid's expense reports for the previous six months. Uponreview of those expense reports, the expense manager identified a number of other suspiciousentries, such as approximately $5,000 in New York City apartment realtor expenses that Rashidcharged to a Relevant Fund, claiming that they were for ""zŁesearch reports"" relating to the f'und'sinvestments when, in fact, they were Rashid's personal expenses.53. In November 2010, Apollo's CFO confronted Rashid about these questionableexpenses. Rashid admitted that they were his personal expenses, and ultimately agreed to payback almost $8,000 in fraudulently billed personal expenses. Apollo's CFO told Rashid thatbilling personal expenses to the private equity funds was not acceptable and instructed hiin not torepeat the conduct.14Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 14 of 28 54. Despite this incident, Rashid failed to acknowledge to Apollo or any of theRelevant Funds that he had previously billed additional personal expenses to the Relevant Funds.55. For example, Rashid failed to disclose to Apollo or any of the Relevant Funds a~'''~S personal charge at high-end clothing store Ermene~ildo Zegna (""Zegna"") from June 2010,which Rashid charged to a Relevant Fund on his expense report by claiming that it was a ""clientlift.`56. When Apollo management asked Rashid about this charge in September 2U 10,Rashid falsely claimed that it was `'shirts and ties"" for fifteen specific portfolio companyexecutives to celebrate the company's IPO. The named executives, however, did not receiveclothing or any other gifts from Rashid. Rashid had falsely made this claim to obtainreimbursement from a Relevant Fund for his own personal charges.57. Rashid also failed to disclose to Apollo ar any of the Relevant Funds inNovember 2010 that he had charged the following personal expenses to the Relevant Funds asbusiness expenses: over $2,300 in charges at the Apple Store in May 2010 for purported ""IPOgifts,"" an additional $1,265 in charges at Zegna in July 2010 for purported ""office gifts,"" and a$275 charge at Bliss Spa for ""a missed appointment due to [portfolio company] conference callt11at rail over Š no last minute cancellations."" None of these expenses were client bifts, and the$275 charge at Bliss was, in fact, for approximately $75 in services for his sister and anapproximately $200 gift card used for Rashid's personal purposes."" ` ~ B. ""~Rashid~Continued to Charge Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds AfterNovember 201058. Nor did the November 2010 incident deter Rashid from continuing to chargepersonal expenses to the Relevant Funds. Only a month later in December 2010, Rashid emailedan Apo110 coznplialice offacer to request pi-e-approval to give purported 1loladay gifts from Zegna15Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 15 of 28 and the Apple Store to executives of at least two of the Relevant Funds' portfolio companies. Tojustify his request, Rashid provided a list of twenty-six portfolio company executives for whomhe intended to purchase gifts. Based on Rashid's misrepresentations, the Apollo complianceofficer approved Rashid's request.59. A few weeks later, Rashid charged more than $3,800 at Zegna and $800 at theApple Store. He allocated these expenses in his ex~~ense report to certain. of the Relevant Fundsin accordance with the purported business justifications in his email to the Apollo complianceofficer.60. Rashid never gave any gifts to the executives that he identified. Instead, hebought items at these stores for himself and his family members.C. Rashid Fraudulently Charged His Vacation Expenses to the Relevant Funds61. Rashid also billed the Relevant Funds for tens of thousands of dollars in expensesfor family vacations.62. For example, Rashid billed two of the Relevant Funds for about $7,500 in airfareand hotel charges for a vacation Rashid and his wife took to attend a friend's wedding in Hawaiiin 2010. Rashid allocated the couple's five-night stay at the ocean-front Ritz Carlton and rentalcar fees to a portfolio company owned by Fund V, and he separately allocated both his and hiswife's airfare to Hawaii to a portfolio company owned by Fund TIL In his expense reports,Rashid justified charging these Relevant Funds for this personal trip by claiming on his expense~~report~that~it~vasfor`a~""busin~esstrip toDai~as for [portfoliocoinpany] meetings"" and a ""[l~]otelfor [portfolio company] conference.""16Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 16 of 28 63. The justifications Rashid provided were false. This trip was personal and had noconnection to the Relevant Funds' or their portfolio companies. Nor was it to Dallas. Rashidknew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these were false business justifications.64. In addition, Ras~lid charged expenses relating to the following vacations to certainof the Relevant Funds: (1) approximately $7,500 for trips to Cancun, Mexico, with his wife overthe New Year's holidays in 2010 and 2011; (2) over $4,500 for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,with his wife over the New Year's holiday in 2012; (3) approximately $1,400 for trips to bed-and-breakfast hotels nearŁ the New Jersey shore in 2009, 2010, and 2011; (4) approximately$5,000 for a trip to the St. Regis Bal Harbour resort in Florida with his parents and sister over theThanksgiving holiday in 201?; and (5) approximately $4,000 for weekend trips to Las Vegas,Nevada in 2012 and 2U 13.65. All of these trips were personal holiday trips and vacations that were notappropriate client charges, yet, ir1 each instance, Rashid submitted expense reports fraudulentlyclaiming them as business expenses, azld Apollo obtained reimbursement for these expensesfrom the Relevant Funds.D. In 2012, Rashid Made Misrepresentations and Falsified a Receipt to JustifyBilling Additional Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds, and AgainAdmitted to Charging Certain Personal Expenses to the Relevant Funds66. In January ?012, Rashid again sought and obtained approval from Apollo'scompliance department to purchase ""holiday gifts"" at Zegna and Bliss Spa for a list of portfolio~co~npanyexecntives: ' I~ this request; Rashid represented that he would ""stay at the limit of $100per person"" and specified t11at he would be purchasing ""Zegna ties for the inen and Bliss giftcards for the Women."" Rashid's pre-approved request specified thirty-eight portfolio companyexecutives to whom lie intended to give holiday gifts.17Case 1:17-cv-08223   Document 1   Filed 10/25/17   Page 17 of 28 b7. Following his request, in ~'ebru~ry 2012, Rashid charged X400 at Bliss to hisApollo credit card and allocated the charge to certain of the Relevant Funds as ""Holiday Gifts.""On April 27, 2012, Rashid charged X3,500 at Zegn~ to his Apollo credit card.6b. On the same day that Rashid made the $3,500 charge at Zegna, he forwarded toleis assistant the compliance department's email approving the purchase of thirty-eight corporategifts of ""Zegna ties for the men and Bliss gift cards for the Women."" Thereafter, in May 201?,when Rashid's assistant received the initial draft of Rashid's monthly Apollo credit card charges,she noticed the $3,500 charge at Zegna and asked him if it was personal. Rashid responded thatit was a business expense and should be allocated to certain of the Relevant Funds as holidaygifts. Because Rashid was travelling at the time, his assistant called Zegna to request a receiptin keeping with Apollo's T&E policies.b9. The Zegna store clerk emailed Rashid's assistant a receipt for the ;3,500 chargeon his Apollo credit. card. The receipt showed the charge was for a suit for Rashid's father, riotfor a business expense oi- business gifts as Rashid had claimed.70. Shortly after Rashid's assistant received the Zegna receipt, she received atelephone call from Rashid asking why she called Zegna for a receipt. She explained thatApollo's T&E policies required a vendor receipt. Rashid then told her the $3,500 receipt Zegnahad sent her for his father's suit was the wrong receipt. and that he would obtain the cor~z~ectreceipt. Thereafter, Rashid emailed a form receipt from Zegz~a to his assistant that was blank--~ ~ ~ except for a llan","On October 25, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mohammed Ali Rashid, a former senior partner at Apollo Management L.P., with defrauding his fund clients by secretly billing them for approximately $290,000 in personal expenditures, including his family vacations, visits to a hair salon, and purchases of designer clothing and high-end electronics.The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid falsely claimed that certain individuals accompanied him to dinners to make it appear various personal expenses had a business purpose, and he doctored a receipt in an effort to justify his purchase of a $3,500 suit for his father as a business expense.According to the SEC's complaint, despite being caught by the firm and told to stop on two occasions in 2010 and 2012, Rashid continued to expense personal items to clients into 2013.  After he was confronted about his expenses for a third time, Rashid admitted that he charged approximately $220,000 in personal expenses.  A forensic accountant then uncovered additional personal expenses that Rashid improperly charged to clients.The SEC's complaint alleges that Rashid violated, and in the alternative aided and abetted violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks penalties and injunctive relief."

COMPLAINT   Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint against Defendants Jared Jeffrey Davis (ﬁDavisﬂ) and Dale Burke Pinchot (ﬁPinchotﬂ) (collectively, ﬁDefendantsﬂ) and alleges as follows:  SUMMARY OF THE ACTION  1.

PageID #: 1 2  2. fraudulent offer and sale of binary options securities to investors. 3. During the Relevant Period, the Defendants collected at least $10 million in investor funds, of which they obtained a portion thereof, while neither was registered with the Commission as either a broker or a dealer nor while either was associated with a broker or dealer registered with the Commission. 4. In connection with the offer and sale of securities to investors, Davis violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)]; Sections 10b and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78o17 C.F.R. § 240.10b5]. 5. In connection with the offer and sale of securities to investors, Pinchot violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, will continue to violate Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)]. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)]. 7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa], and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. 8. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)]. Acts, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein have occurred within the Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  2 of 15.  PageID #: 2 3  jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere. Moreover, the Defendants transacted business in this district. Venue also is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims discussed herein occurred within this district [28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)]. 9. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange in connection with the alleged acts, practices, and courses of business. DEFENDANTS 10. Jared Jeffrey Davis, born 1976, is last known to be a resident of Sandusky, Ohio. Davis and business partner Pinchot directly or indirectly owned multiple companies and internet websites that offered binary options securities trading to investors, and Davis served as the primary manager of the overall enterprise.   11. Dale Burke Pinchot, born 1970, is last known to be a resident of Yardley, Pennsylvania, and was the partner of Davis in the binary options business. STATEMENT OF FACTS A. Binary Options 12. A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely on the outcome of a yes/no, or binary, proposition or event such as whether the price of a particular underlying asset (e.g., an individual stock, an index of stocks, a currency, a commodity) will rise above or fall below a specified amount at a specified future point in time. 13. Once the option is acquired by the investor, there is typically no further decision for the investor to make regarding the exercise of the binary option because binary option Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  3 of 15.  PageID #: 3 4  contracts exercise automatically at expiration. 14. Unlike some other types of options, binary option contracts do not give the holder the right to buy or sell the specified underlying asset. When the binary option expires, the option holder typically receives an amount (sometimes referred to as the ﬁpayoutﬂ) that is either a pre-determined amount or a percentage return based on initial investment (i.e., the premium) or loses all or nearly all of his or her investment. For example, a binary option contract with Apple stock as its underlying asset might, on the question of whether or not the price of Apple stock will be above or below $X per share five minutes hence, offer investors terms of a 70% payout on a winning trade or a 100% loss of capital on a losing trade. 15. Given this all-or-nothing payout structure, binary option contracts are also sometimes referred to as ﬁall-or-nothing optionsﬂ or ﬁfixed-return options.ﬂ 16. Binary option contracts based on securities and securities-based indices are themselves securities and thus are subject to the federal securities laws. B. The Unregistered Binary Options Industry 17. The unregistered binary options industry is often composed of three primary components sometimes referred to as ﬁplatforms,ﬂ ﬁbrands,ﬂ and ﬁaffiliate marketers.ﬂ 18. Platforms, frequently based in Israel but sometimes based in other locations, such as Bulgaria, are, as the moniker implies, the foundation of the unregistered binary options industry.  19. Platforms offer services for a fee that other intermediaries, called brands (discussed below), purchase or license and that may include software related to (a) trade entry and execution services, (b) customer account and client relationship management (ﬁCRMﬂ), (c) access to investment products (i.e., various binary option contracts), and (d) back office IT Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  4 of 15.  PageID #: 4 5  support. Some platforms also provide introductions to affiliate marketers (described below). 20. Brands, also known in the unregistered binary options industry as ﬁprivate labels,ﬂ ﬁwhite labels,ﬂ or ﬁbrokers,ﬂ may be established with a relatively modest investment and typically operate under a trade name while contracting with a platform for trade, customer account, and back office systems and services. 21. Generally, brand operators, such as the Defendants, possess custody of customer funds, do not charge commissions on trades, and are the counterparty to each customer binary options transaction. 22. Affiliate marketers are independent entities who produce sophisticated internet marketing campaigns centered on ephemeral websites and videos promoting the purportedly extraordinary and easy profits that can be obtained through binary options trading (although some campaigns may not specifically mention binary options). 23. These internet marketing campaigns, including those hired by Davis, frequently employ false statements, false testimonials, and/or falsified trading results, created by the affiliate marketer, to lure potential victims in and to shepherd them, for a fee, to binary option brand websites such as those operated by the Defendants. C. Economics of the Unregistered Binary Options Industry and Binary Option Brands  24. The economic basis of the unregistered binary options industry as participated in by the Defendants is predicated upon the knowledge that, in the aggregate and utilizing sufficiently volatile underlying assets, investors are likely to win only slightly more than 50% of their trades. 25. By structuring binary option contracts such that investors will be credited, typically, with only a 70-85% payout on winning trades and a 95-100% loss of capital on losing Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  5 of 15.  PageID #: 5 6  trades, the binary options industry can rely on the almost equal distribution of trade outcomes (i.e., wins and losses) to, as with casinos, mathematically assure themselves of a profit over time. 26. Brands, such as those operated by the Defendants, derive their revenue from being the counterparty to losing customer trades and retaining what is forfeited by customers thereby. In other words, binary option brands, such as those operated by the Defendants, have a keen interest in having their customers lose money through binary options trading. 27. To better ensure this profitable (to the brand) outcome, at least some platforms offered their brand customers access to software services or protocols, sometimes referred to as ﬁrisk management,ﬂ that would further increase the odds against investor customers of the brands. 28. These risk management protocols, applied at the platform level to investor accounts at the request of the brand operator, act to increase the likelihood that a given customer™s binary option trades will ﬁloseﬂ (and the opposite can be done with the accounts of discouraged customers in order to induce them, via experiencing a limited number of winning trades, to keep trading and/or to deposit additional funds into their binary options trading account).  29. Thus, brands, such as those operated by the Defendants, in order to generate meaningful and ongoing revenue require three things: (i) that customers actively trade their binary options accounts (i.e., so that the effects of the math underlying the payout structure have an opportunity to apply); (ii) that that trading is unsuccessful (i.e., customers lose money to the brand via losing trades); and (iii) that a constant stream of new customers is found to replace those who have either lost all of their investment capital or who have closed their account after discovering that binary options trading is unlikely to prove a profitable long-term endeavor.  Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  6 of 15.  PageID #: 6 7  D. The Defendants™ Binary Options Business 30. During or before early 2012, the Defendants undertook steps, including the formation of various foreign shell companies with foreign bank accounts, to establish their first binary options brand, OptionMint (www.optionmint.com). 31. Over the next few years, the Defendants established an additional three brandsŠOptionKing (www.optionking.com), Option Queen (www.optionqueen.com), and OptionPrince (www.optionprince.com)Šadditional foreign shell companies with foreign bank accounts, and, operating at various times, three call centers (with employees) located in Sandusky, Ohio; Costa Rica; and Sint Maarten. 32. This binary options enterprise, referred to hereinafter as the ﬁEnterprise,ﬂ although co-owned by the Defendants, was at all times primarily managed by Davis. 33. During the Relevant Period, the Enterprise accepted, as customers, investors located throughout the United States and around the world and offered and sold to them binary option contracts on individual stocks, stock indices, currencies, and commodities collecting at least $10 million (in aggregate) from them thereby of which the Defendants obtained a portion thereof. 34. The offer and sale of binary option securities (i.e., those binary options based on securities and securities-based indices) by the Defendants and the Enterprise was not registered with the Commission, and neither were the Defendants or the Enterprise registered with the Commission as either a broker or a dealer, and nor were the Defendants associated with a broker or dealer registered with the Commission. 35. In connection with the offer, purchase (by investors), and sale of binary option securities, Davis, directly or indirectly through the Enterprise, engaged in the making of Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  7 of 15.  PageID #: 7 8  misstatements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading and obtained money or property from binary options securities investors thereby. For example, Davis (a) in Enterprise marketing emails and/or in Enterprise telephone sales scripts used by Enterprise call center employees (both of which were approved by Davis), misrepresented the number of successful binary option investors the Enterprise had and omitted the fact that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of his or her trades, (b) misrepresented the security of investor funds which were, in fact, comingled with the general funds of the Enterprise, (c) misrepresented the knowledge and experience of Enterprise employees who advised customers on binary options trading, (d) misrepresented the Enterprise™s interest in seeing its customers succeed by omitting to disclose the basic fact that the Enterprise, and thus the Defendants, effectively took the opposing position on each trade and thus required customers to lose money via binary options trading in order for the Enterprise and the Defendants to make money, and (e) failed to disclose that Davis and the Enterprise could and oftentimes would increase the odds against customer success via application of risk management protocols. 36. Davis also engaged in misstatements and omissions in the Terms & Conditions section of the OptionMint website (which he controlled). For example, although this section contained a risk disclosure statement, it was silent on the ability of Davis, via the Enterprise, to have risk management protocols applied to the accounts of winning customers. Similarly, although this section contained a disclosure that ﬁbonus moneyﬂ (an inducement, such as, for example, a matching $500 credit on a $500 deposit made in order to lure wavering prospective customers into opening and funding a binary options account) must be turned over (i.e., traded) 30 times before it could be withdrawn by the customer, it was silent on the fact that, Case: 3:18-cv-02829  Doc #: 1  Filed:  12/10/18  8 of 15.  PageID #: 8 9  mathematically, an investor was likely to lose all of his or her investment capital prior to achieving this turnover level. Finally, although this section discussed OptionMint™s ﬁknow-your-customerﬂ policy and the supposed need for obtaining certain identifying documents from customers, it was silent about the fact that Davis, via the Enterprise, could and would use those documents against customers who attempted to effect a debit/credit card chargeback once they realized that they had been misinformed about the realities of binary options trading. 37. Davis also, directly or indirectly through the Enterprise, engaged in a fraudulent scheme. In addition to Davis™s misrepresentations and omissions described above, Davis also directed Enterprise employees to (a) disseminate fake trading results to customers in an effort to get them to enter into binary option trades, (b) have risk management protocols applied to the accounts of ﬁwinningﬂ customers so that their subsequent trades would be less likely to win, and (c) ﬁburnﬂ certain customer accounts through excessive trading. 38. Pinchot, as a business partner, financier, and benefactor of the overall Enterprise, knew or should have known about the Enterprise™s operations and trading activities, including the misrepresentations and omissions described herein. E. Summation 39. Through the conduct described herein, Davis, via the Enterprise, violated (a) the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; (b) the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; (c) the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rul-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act in connection with securities offered through the Enterprise and improperly obtained money thereby. 40.

PageID #: 9 10  violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with securities offered through the Enterprise and improperly obtained money thereby.

PageID #: 15","The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an Ohio resident and his Pennsylvania business partner in connection with an unregistered and fraudulent binary options business.According to the SEC's complaint, Jared Jeffrey Davis and various shell companies controlled by Davis and his business partner, Dale Burke Pinchot, engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered binary option securities under the brand names OptionMint, OptionKing, Option Queen, and OptionPrince. According to the complaint, Davis misrepresented the number of investors who successfully traded binary options and failed to disclose that, to be successful, an investor would need to win an unlikely high percentage of trades. The complaint alleges that Davis, Pinchot, and their companies effectively took the opposing position on each trade and therefore made money when customers entered into losing binary options trades. The complaint further alleges that Davis failed to inform investors that he frequently manipulated the options trading software to increase the odds of investor losses.To learn more about binary options fraud, see Investor Alert: Binary Options Websites may be Used for Fraudulent Schemes.The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio, charges Davis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and charges Pinchot with violating antifraud provision Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis and Pinchot consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any binary option security. The final judgments provide that the court will determine disgorgement and civil penalties at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio announced criminal charges against Davis on June 5, 2018.The SEC's investigation was conducted by James Thibodeau and Justin Sutherland of the Commission's Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Regional Director Daniel Wadley. The litigation will be led by David Whipple and Amy Oliver.

Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon, with and through their company, SeeThruEquity,LLC (""STE""), defrauded investors and prospective investors by purporting to provide unbiasedresearch reports on certain publicly-traded small and microcap companies. Defendantsrepresented that STE's reports were ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for,"" that the price targets includedin them were objectively determined, that Defendants did not own the stocks being covered, andthat Defendants took precautions to maintain STE's objectivity. Contrary to those claims,Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 1 of 25 Defendants were compensated handsomely by the covered companies for the research reportsthey published. In addition, Defendants inflated price targets for the companies for which theypublished research reports and made other false statements and omissions, repeatedly violatingboth the anti-fraud and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.2. In addition, Ajay Tandon violated the anti-fraud provisions by investing in STE-covered companies and selling his holdings in the immediate aftermath of favorable STEresearch reports, reaping profits from that illegal pattern of trading.JURISDICTION AND VENUE3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(d)(1) and22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d)(1) and 77v(a)] andSections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [ 15U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].4. The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means andinstrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails or of the facilities of a national securitiesexchange, in connection with the acts, practices and courses of business alleged herein, certain ofwhich occurred within the Southern District of New York.5. Venue in this district is proper under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because defendantstransact business in this district and certain of the acts, practices, transactions and courses ofbusiness constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within the Southern District of NewYork.2Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 2 of 25 THE DEFENDANTS6. SeeThruEquity, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that was co-founded in 2011 by brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon. STE purports to be a stockresearch company that primarily covers small and microcap issuers. In addition to publishingstock research reports, which it has done since its inception in 2011, STE also periodically hostsinvestor conferences, which it has done approximately twenty-five times since June 2012.7. Aiay Tandon, 41, is a resident of New York, New York. He is the co-founderand CEO of defendant STE. He has experience in the securities industry, having held Series 7and 63 licenses (general securities representative) as well as a Series 241icense (generalsecurities principal).8. Amit Tandon, 47, is a resident of New York, New York. He is the co-founderand Director of Research of defendant STE. He is an attorney and a member of the New YorkBar.FACTSBackground of SeeThruEquity, LLC9. Unless another time is specified, each of the allegations in this Complaint refers tothe period November 9, 2013 to present.10. STE purports to be an equity research company focused on smaller emerginggrowth companies.11. Headquartered in New York City (Manhattan) at all times described herein, STEpublishes research reports on the companies that it covers.3Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 3 of 25 12. STE posts those research reports (including all reports referred to herein) on itswebsite (www.seethruequity.com), distributes them to an opt-in email distribution list estimatedto include 20,000 investors, transmits them for further distribution to aggregators of equityresearch reports such as Thomson First Call, makes them available via links to its website onother social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, and, often, announces and links tothem through press releases.13. Brothers Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon co-founded STE in 2011.14. Amit Tandon filed the formation documents for STE, creating the company as aDelaware single member limited liability company.15. Ajay Tandon is the sole member of STE and its Chief Executive Officer.16. Amit Tandon is STE's Director of Research.17. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon had log-in credentials for STE's website andsocial media accounts.18. Ajay Tandon and, from approximately early 2016, Amit Tandon, had signatoryauthority over STE's primary bank account.19. Both Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon drew regular salaries from STE.Research Reports on Companies in STE's Coverage Universe20. Defendants refer to the collection of companies for which STE has issuedresearch reports as STE's ""coverage universe.""21. As of the date of this complaint, STE's coverage universe consists of at least 240companies.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 4 of 25 22. An STE ""initiation report"" is STE's first research report on a company. Suchreports typically are 15 to 20 pages long.23. An STE '`update report'"" is a research report on a company for which STE haspreviously published an initiation report. Such reports typically are three to five pages long.24. Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon divided roughly evenly the responsibilities ofSTE's research business, including responsibility for overseeing the completion of STE researchreports.25. In general, the Tandon brother responsible for any specific report is listed as a""contact person"" in the specific report.26. The report preparation process began with Ainit Tandon or Ajay Tandon giving toan analyst, retained as an STE contractor, an assignment to prepare a research report.27. STE compensated its contract analysts on a per report basis, typically at a rate of$1,000 per report.28. Having received an assignment, STE's contract analysts input relevant financialdata into a spreadsheet quantitative model (""the STE Model"" or ""Model"")) designed to perform aquantitative analysis and produce certain outputs, including a purportedly objective ""price target""for the company's stock.29. Each STE research report listed the price target next to a recent historical price ofthe stock.30. For example, the October 5, 2017 STE initiation report published on issuerCemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), includes the following:Price Target: $6.45Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 5 of 25 Recent Share Price: $2.8431. Investors and prospective investors who read that report therefore wouldreasonably conclude that STE's purportedly objective analysis revealed a potential for priceappreciation in CETX stock of more than double the current trading price.32. Every single purportedly objective price target that STE has ever published hasbeen higher than the stock in question's then-current trading price.33. STE's contract analysts used the product of the STE Model to prepare a draft ofthe research report, which they then forwarded either to Amit Tandon or Ajay Tandon,depending on which of the Tandons had given them the assignment.34. Working from the draft, Amit Tandon and Ajay Tandon finalized, published, anddistributed the research reports.35. As more fully set forth below, in connection with the creation and publication ofSTE research reports and related communications, Defendants made misrepresentations andomissions relating to, among other things: (1) the supposed ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" natureof STE's research, (2) Ajay Tandon's ownership of stocks in the STE coverage universe, (3) theobjectivity of STE's published price targets, (4) the existence of ""customary internal tradingrestrictions,"" and (5) the scalping of STE covered-stocks.Misrepresentations and Omissions RegardingSupposedly ""Unbiased"" and ""Not Paid For"" Research36. All of the research reports issued by Defendants from November 9, 2013 throughat least March 30, 2018, made the representation, or some variation thereof, that ""SeeThruEquityCase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 6 of 25 has not been compensated for the preparation of this report by any third party or the companycovered in the report.""37. STE also represented on its website, on which it posted all STE research reports,and in press releases that often accompanied newly issued STE research reports, that its researchwas ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for.""38. Both Ajay Tandon and Amit Tandon knew when they finalized and issued thereports for which they were responsible that these representations in STE's reports and pressreleases and on STE's website were false and that STE had, in fact, been compensated for eachreport to the tune of several thousand dollars in each instance.39. In addition, Ajay Tandon, as STE's CEO and the person with ultimate authorityover the content of STE's research reports, provided substantial assistance to STE by approvingfor publication STE's reports, all of which omitted any disclosure regarding the compensationreceived for those reports.40. To obscure the compensation they received for preparing and disseminatingresearch reports, Defendants ostensibly invited companies to make a ""presentation"" at aninvestor conference in return for STE providing a ""free"" research report for that company.41. Defendants charged between $4,000 and $7,000 for the company to make apresentation at an STE conference. Defendants then claimed that the STE equity research reportthat STE published thereafter was provided at no charge.42. Defendants held out the research reports as ""not paid for,"" although they receivedthousands of dollars for issuing each research report.7Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 7 of 25 43. On at least one occasion, Ajay Tandon directed a STE research analyst to put aresearch report on hold because a company had ""not paid for the conference.""44. Approximately 233 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 97%, paid STE ostensible conference presentation fees, andfour other companies paid STE for supposed ""distribution"" or ""press release"" services relating toSTE's research. Put another way, 237 out of the 241 companies in STE's research coverageuniverse as of March 30, 2018, or 98%, paid STE.45. STE received at least $500,000 from companies in its coverage universe, fromJanuary 1, 2014 to the present.46. In at least one instance, Defendants did not even bother to hide behind theirconference model.47. Specifically, in September 2017, Cemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) explicitlyagreed to pay STE $14,500, in exchange for STE providing Cemtrex 18 months of researchcoverage, including one initiation report and five quarterly update reports, with press releases toaccompany each report.48. Defendant Ajay Tandon negotiated this arrangement with CETX49. Yet the press release announcing the publication of the CETX initiation reportincluded the following:SeeThruEquity has pioneered an innovative business model forequity research that is not paid for and is unbiased. (emphasisadded).50. None of the Defendants' research reports for CETX disclosed this compensation.Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 8 of 25 51. Beginning in or about August 2016, STE began stating in its ""Disclosures"" that it""may"" receive compensation from the companies featured in its report for ""non-report-relatedservices,"" including presenting at STE conferences. At no time, however, did any of theDefendants tell investors and prospective investors that STE was in fact receiving compensationfrom the covered companies.Defendants' Research Reports for Quadrant 4 Systems Corp.Misrepresent Compensation and Ownership of a Covered Stock52. In connection with its coverage of Quadrant 4 Systems Corp. (OTCMKTS:QFOR), Defendants concocted an elaborate scheme to conceal STE's receipt of compensationfrom that issuer and ownership of the issuer's shares, structuring the payment of QFOR sharesthrough athird-party nominee.53. Ajay Tandon was primarily responsible for the QFOR initiation report (issued inDecember 2012), and update report (issued in December 2013).54. Approximately one month prior to the publication of the initiation report, QFORissued a QFOR stock certificate for 10,000 shares of restricted stock to a Rajinder Bither(""Bither"").55. Bither is Ajay and Amit Tandon's uncle.56. Bither has never lived in the United States. He lives in India.57. Rather than mail the stock certificate to Bither in India, however, Ajay Tandondirected the issuer (or its transfer agent) to mail the stock certificate to STE's Manhattan office.58. Bither has never done any work for QFOR or STE, but the 10,000 shares ofQFOR issued to Bither were allegedly compensation for consulting work he did for QFOR.ECase 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 9 of 25 59. The only evidence of that consulting work is a ""consulting agreement"" purportingto be between Bither and QFOR.60. As originally drafted, the consulting agreement was between QFOR and STE, notBither.61. There are handwritten edits on the consulting agreement by which someonecrossed out STE's name and inserted Bither's.62. The consulting agreement was edited to hide the fact that Ajay Tandon owned10,000 shares of QFOR, received as payment for a favorable STE research report.63. In December 2012, STE published its initiation report on QFOR.64. STE's price target for QFOR in the initiation report was $.59, more than fourtimes the then-current trading price of $.14.65. The December 2012 QFOR initiation report falsely claimed that neither STE norits principals owned shares of QFOR.66. In December 2013, STE published its QFOR update report.67. That December 2013 report falsely claimed that neither STE nor its principalsowned shares of QFOR.68. Ajay Tandon and STE still had the 10,000 certificated shares (issued to Bither) intheir possession on the day the update report was published in December 2013.69. Ajay Tandon considered those shares his, and he knew that the insertion of Bitherinto the scenario was designed to hide his ownership of these shares.70. In fact, on December 4, 2013, five days prior to the publication of the updatereport, Ajay Tandon wrote a letter to the QFOR transfer agent requesting the removal of the10Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 10 of 25 restrictive legend from the 10,000 shares and further asking that the shares be reissued,unrestricted, in his (Ajay Tandon's) name.71. An unrestricted QFOR share certificate was in fact issued in Ajay Tandon's nameon December 9, 2013, the same day that STE published the QFOR update report.72. By using his uncle's name on the QFOR consulting agreement and as the initialpurported holder of QFOR stock, Ajay Tandon hid the fact that STE was not the ""unbiased""equity research company that the Tandons represented it to be.73. Moreover, QFOR is not the only stock about which Ajay Tandon hasmisrepresented share ownership.74. In 2014 and 2015, Ajay Tandon gave multiple interviews to an online publicationcalled the Life Sciences Report.75. In each of his interviews he affirmatively disclaimed both stock ownership andany financial interest in the issuers discussed.76. However, at the time he was interviewed, Ajay Tandon owned stock in at leasttwo of the issuers discussed during the interviews, and nearly all of the issuers discussed hadpaid to present at STE conferences.Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Objectivity of STE Price Targets77. As mentioned above (paragraphs 26 through 34), Defendants contracted withanalysts to perform purportedly objective quantitative modeling in order to project future pricesof equity securities of STE-covered issuers.78. The Defendants used the STE Model from the inception of STE in 2011 topresent.11Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 11 of 25 79. The STE Model required an STE analyst to input certain data about the issuer, atwhich point the Model would produce a figure called a ""price target,"" representing the Model'sprojection of what a share of the issuer's stock would be worth in the future.80. STE often issued press releases in conjunction with publication of its researchreports and often highlighted the ""price target"" in such releases.81. Although the STE Model through which STE performed analysis of issuersyielded a supposedly objective price target, 100% of STE's published price targets were inexcess of the then-current trading price.82. Moreover, STE often published a different, higher, price target, going well abovethe Model's initial results.83. Having paid STE thousands of dollars, issuers expected to, and often did, receiveinput into the substance of STE's supposedly unbiased research reports, including the pricetarget.84. Again, for all 233 companies in STE's coverage universe as of March 31, 2018 onwhich STE had issued a price target, every single price target was higher than the subject stock'scurrent trading price.85. Moreover, the average STE price target was more than 300% higher than thecurrent trading price.86. Both Ajay and Amit Tandon periodically instructed STE analysts to increase theprice targets generated by the STE Model.87. On the instruction of the Tandons, STE analysts increased the price targets abovethe targets generated by the STE Model.12Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 12 of 25 88. On occasion, the Tandons instructed their analysts to make the price target acertain specific figure, or within a specific range, even before the financial modeling had beencompleted.89. By way of specific example for a report created by Amit Tandon, in March 2017,in connection with the preparation of a research report on a company with the ticker symbolFTNW, Amit Tandon instructed the analyst preparing the draft (""Analyst 1 ""), ""Let's try and do$2.75 on the PT.""90. Analyst 1 complied, and Amit Tandon approved the report for release on March21, 2017, with a price target of $2.75.91. The FTNW report does not disclose that Amit Tandon dictated the price target forFTNW.92. On other occasions the Tandons directed STE analysts to increase the price targetsafter issuers Šwho were provided an initial draft of the report before publication Šcomplainedthat the price target should be higher.93. The Defendants failed to disclose in STE reports that price targets were increasedin order to better satisfy the issuers.94. Such information would have been important to a reasonable investor.95. The above-mentioned QFOR update report issued in December 2013 (seeparagraphs 52 through 73) provides another example of undisclosed influence (this time of AjayTandon) on STE's supposedly unbiased price targets.96. In December 2013, QFOR was trading at $1.14.13Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 13 of 25 97. In or about November 2013, an STE analyst (""Analyst 2"") was assigned toprepare a draft of the QFOR update report.98. Analyst 2 input the relevant data into the STE quantitative model, at which pointthe model produced a price target of $1.78, 56 percent above the then-current price ($1.14).99. On December 6, 2013, Analyst 2 sent Ajay Tandon the draft QFOR update reportshowing the price target of $1.78.100. On the morning of December 9, the date of publication, Ajay Tandon respondedto Analyst 2, stating, ""let's push it north of $2,"" referring to the price target.101. Analyst 2 responded, ""I can make it any #, but I had to stretch it very much just toget to these #s.""102. Ajay Tandon responded that he nevertheless wanted to push the price target""above $2, because it is a stock `hurdle' if you get my meaning.""103. Analyst 2 responded, ""[u]nderstood, just wanted to let you know this one is a realstretch,"" and Ajay Tandon stated, ""[fair enough."" Analyst 2 then adjusted the price target to$2.26 in a 10:47 AM draft of the report.104. Around noon on December 9, Ajay Tandon sent the draft update report, with the$2.26 price target, to QFOR's CEO.105. QFOR's CEO expressed displeasure with the price target.106. In reaction to that displeasure, Ajay Tandon instructed Analyst 2 to raise the pricetarget further.14Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 14 of 25 107. By 3:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised STE'sprice target to $3.16, at which point Ajay Tandon told Analyst 2 that he still wanted it raised""considerably.""108. By 4:30 PM on December 9, at Ajay Tandon's direction, Analyst 2 raised theprice target to $5.25Šmore than double the ""real stretch"" price target of earlier in the day.109. Thereafter, also on December 9, 2013, Ajay Tandon finalized and publishedSTE's update report on QFOR by, among other things, posting it on the STE website,distributing it to the STE opt-in email distribution list, transmitting it to Thomson First Call, FactSet, and Capital IQ, and issuing a press release.110. That press release said, among other things:SeeThruEquity, LLC, a New York City based firm focused onproviding unbiased and institutional equity research ... issued acompany update report on ... QFOR.SeeThruEquity is an approved equity research contributor onThomson One Analytics (First Call).[STE] research is unbiased and not paid for research.111. In truth, the research report was both paid for and biased.112. No investor reading the report or the press release could know that the price targetreflected in the published QFOR report was nearly 300 percent higher than the price targetproduced by STE's supposedly objective quantitative analysis, nor that Ajay Tandon had orderedthe price target increased dramatically to better please the issuer.113. Both the facts misrepresented and the facts omitted would have been important toa reasonable investor.15Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 15 of 25 Misrepresentations Concerning Nonexistent ""Customary Trading Restrictions""114. In or about August 2016, STE began adding language to the ""Disclosures"" portionof each STE research report, including initiation and update reports, stating that STE ""followscustomary internal trading restrictions pending the release of its reports.""115. That representation was false each time the Defendants made it, and it furtheredthe false impression that STE reports were not colored by the Tandons' financial interests.116. At no time did STE have any formal or informal trading restrictions, and theTandons observed no such restrictions.117. In fact, on at least one occasion described in more detail below, Ajay Tandonengaged in scalping of an STE-covered stock despite STE representing that it ""follow[ed]customary internal trading restrictions pending release of its report.""118. Specifically, on October 24, 2016, Ajay Tandon scalped an STE-covered stock(MassRoots, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MSRT)) on the same day that STE published a research report onthe issuer that contained the misrepresentation about `'customary internal trading restrictions.''Ajay Tandon Scalped Covered Stocks119. Making a stock recommendation and then contemporaneously trading against thatrecommendation without adequate disclosure of that trading is a form of securities fraud knownas ""scalping.""120. Ajay Tandon engaged in multiple instances of scalping between 2014 and thepresent.121. A representative example of Ajay Tandon's scalping occurred in 2014. In mid-January 2014, the issuer Medient Studios, Inc. (OTCMKTS: MDNT) was introduced to STE.16Case 1:18-cv-10374   Document 1   Filed 11/08/18   Page 16 of 25 122. By January 27, 2014, MDNT had agreed to pay STE several thousand dollars forresearch.123. On March 17, 2014, Ajay Tandon purchased $12,700 of MDNT stock-850,000shares, at an average share price of approximately $.015.124. The next dayŠMarch 18, 2014STE published its initiation report on MDNT,with a price target of $.13, more than eight tunes the price Ajay Tandon paid for his shares theday prior.125. Also on March 18, MDNT's stock price nearly doubledŠfrom approximately$.O1 to $.02Šand Ajay 'I'andon sold all 850,000 shares, for cone-day profit of approximately$6,500.126.

By reason of the","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a stock research firm and its co-founders with defrauding investors by issuing reports purportedly based on ""unbiased"" and ""not paid for"" research when in reality they received thousands of dollars from issuers as a condition to providing each report.According to the SEC's complaint, SeeThruEquity LLC and brothers Ajay and Amit Tandon camouflaged the payments by inviting companies to make a ""presentation"" at an investor conference in order to receive a research report for free.  SeeThru and the Tandons allegedly collected up to several thousand dollars in conference presentation fees per company, and the issuers regularly had input into the substance of the supposedly unbiased research reports, even including the price targets at times. The SEC alleges that the Tandons often instructed SeeThru analysts to use different, higher price targets for covered issuers than those yielded through purported quantitative analysis, and the price targets contained in SeeThru's reports were typically more than 300 percent above the current trading price of the stock.The SEC further alleges that Ajay Tandon, who serves as CEO, frequently traded in the same stocks that SeeThru was evaluating despite stating in published interviews and elsewhere that neither the firm nor its principals traded in securities for which they published research.  According to the SEC's complaint, Tandon also engaged in scalping, which is a form of securities fraud that occurs when a perpetrator makes a stock recommendation to investors and contemporaneously trades against that very recommendation in the open market without adequate disclosure.""There is a clear line between paid advertising and unbiased research coverage, and we allege that SeeThru and its co-founders crossed it to deceive investors and make money,"" said Richard R. Best, Director of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office.  ""According to our complaint, Ajay Tandon even scalped multiple issuers, further revealing the biased nature of SeeThru's research reports.""The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Ajay and SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Amit with aiding and abetting those violations. It also charges SeeThru with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; charges Ajay with violating the antifraud and antitouting provisions of Sections 17(a) and (b) of the Securities Act; charges Amit with violating the antitouting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act; and charges Ajay with aiding and abetting certain of SeeThru's antifraud and antitouting violations. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction that would bar Ajay, Amit, and SeeThru from promoting the issuer of any security, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director and penny stock bars.The SEC's litigation will be led by Pat Huddleston II and Paul Kim of the Atlanta office.  The SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua M. Dickman and supervised by Natalie M. Brunson of the Atlanta office."

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78u-1].   2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. 3.

On information and belief, Defendant Rong Chen is an inhabitant, transacts business, and may be found in the Central District of California.  Relief Defendant Yuehong Wang is Chen™s wife and is an inhabitant of and may be found in the Central District of California.  Wang resides, and, on information and belief, Chen at least periodically resides, at their home in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.      5. Chen has directly or indirectly made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business alleged herein. 6. Chen will, unless enjoined, continue to engage in the acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint, or in acts, practices, transactions, and courses of business of similar purport and object. SUMMARY 7. Over a two year period, Defendant Rong Chen engaged in multiple acts of insider trading by making timely and highly profitable securities purchases based on material nonpublic information about the impending acquisitions of two China-based companies whose securities traded on exchanges in the United States.  Chen obtained this inside information in the course of his work advising the acquiring Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 2 of 14   Page ID #:2  COMPLAINT 3   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728companies on these transactions.  Attempting to conceal his insider trading, Chen placed his trades using the brokerage account of his wife, Yuehong Wang.  Chen™s insider trading generated more than $173,000 in illicit profits, the majority of which Chen transferred to his and Wang™s joint bank account.  Because Wang shared the benefits of Chen™s illegal conduct, she is named as a Relief Defendant in this action.  8. Chen™s first set of insider trades occurred while he was the Vice President of Investments for the Chinese company Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (ﬁTsinghuaﬂ).  On November 11, 2013, Tsinghua publicly announced that it would acquire another Chinese company, RDA Microelectronics, Inc. (ﬁRDAﬂ).  Prior to that announcement, Chen used his wife™s U.S. brokerage account to make a series of well-timed purchases of RDA securities, generating profits of more than $79,500 following the acquisition announcement.  Chen personally worked on the RDA acquisition, and made those trades based on material, nonpublic information not available to the investing public.   9. In early 2015, Chen again engaged in insider trading, this time purchasing securities of the Chinese company 58.com Inc. (ﬁ58.comﬂ).  By January 2015, Chen was working as an investment consultant to 58.com on the acquisition of a large stake in a rival company.  Shortly before the acquisition was announced to the public, Chen used his wife™s brokerage account to buy ﬁout of the moneyﬂ 58.com call options on a U.S. exchange.  When news of the acquisition became public, 58.com™s stock price skyrocketed, and Chen sold his options, earning profits of more than $94,400.  Again, by virtue of his work on the deal, when he purchased the 58.com options Chen had knowledge of material, nonpublic information that was not available to other investors.   10. Chen™s insider trading violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5).  The Commission brings this action to hold Chen accountable for his illegal conduct, permanently enjoin Chen from further insider trading, and impose civil penalties.  Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 3 of 14   Page ID #:3  COMPLAINT 4   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728The Commission also seeks an order requiring Chen and Wang to, jointly and severally, pay disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest on all ill-gotten gains they received by virtue of Chen™s insider trading.   COMMONLY-USED TRADING TERMS 11. A stock option, commonly referred to as an ﬁoption,ﬂ gives its purchaser-holder the option to buy or sell shares of an underlying stock at a specified price (the ﬁstrike priceﬂ) before a specified time (the ﬁexpirationﬂ).  Options are generally sold in ﬁcontracts,ﬂ which give the option holder the opportunity to buy or sell 100 shares of an underlying stock.  If the holder does not exercise the option prior to the expiration date, the option expires as worthless. 12. A ﬁcallﬂ option, such as those purchased by Chen, gives the purchaser-holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security at a specified strike price prior to expiration.  For example, one ﬁDecember 2013 $15ﬂ call on ABC Co.™s shares would give the purchaser the right to buy 100 ABC shares for $15 per share before the call expired on a specified date in December 2013.  Generally, the buyer of a call option anticipates that the price of the underlying security will increase prior to expiration.  If the call option™s strike price is above the price at which the underlying stock is trading, the call option is considered to be ﬁout of the money,ﬂ because it would be unprofitable to exercise the call and pay more for the stock than the price for which it could be obtained in the market.  Conversely, if the strike price is below the then-current market price, the call is considered to be ﬁin the money,ﬂ because one could exercise the option, obtain the stock at the strike price, and then sell it at the higher market price for a profit.  For a given expiration month, out of the money options are typically cheaper to buy than those that are in the money. // // // Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 4 of 14   Page ID #:4  COMPLAINT 5   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728FACTS The Defendant and Relief Defendant 13. Defendant Rong Chen, 50 years old, is a United States citizen.  On information and belief, Chen resides both in China and Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  During the period at issue in this lawsuit, Chen worked as a Vice President for Investments at Tsinghua, and later worked as a managing director at a Hong Kong investment banking firm. 14. Relief Defendant Yuehong Wang is a United States citizen who resides in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  Wang is Chen™s wife.  Wang and Chen share a joint bank account that received the proceeds of Chen™s insider trading. Relevant Entities 15. Tsinghua is a Chinese company engaged in electronics, biotechnology, science park development, and urban infrastructure development.   16. RDA was a China-based semiconductor company that produced component parts used in mobile phones.  RDA™s American Depository Shares (ﬁADSﬂ) traded on NASDAQ (ticker: RDA) until RDA was acquired by Tsinghua in July 2014.  Prior to the acquisition, RDA options traded on U.S. securities exchanges including NASDAQ and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (ﬁCBOEﬂ).  17. 58.com is a China-based company that operates one of China™s largest online marketplaces, transferring products and services between purchasers and sellers.  58.com™s shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: WUBA), and its options are traded on U.S. securities exchanges including CBOE and the New York Stock Exchange. 18. ganji.com was a privately held China-based online classified advertisement company which was a business competitor of 58.com.  Chen™s RDA Insider Trading 19. In September 2013, RDA had discussions with its investment banking advisors about potential acquisition opportunities.   Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 5 of 14   Page ID #:5  COMPLAINT 6   1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272820. On September 27, 2013, RDA publicly announced that it had received a non-binding acquisition proposal from a potential buyer at $15.50 per ADS.   21. By October 2013, Chen was employed by Tsinghua as its Vice President for Investments.  In that position, Chen had access to and possessed material, nonpublic information about Tsinghua™s acquisition of RDA described herein.  Chen also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he was required to keep information about the acquisition confidential.   22. On October 21, 2013, personnel from RDA and Tsinghua met to discuss a potential acquisition and, three days later, the companies executed a non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.   23. On October 24, 2013, the potential buyer that submitted the acquisition proposal previously announced on September 27 informed RDA that it would not consider increasing its acquisition offer.   24. The next day, October 25, Tsinghua made an acquisition proposal to RDA for $18.00 per ADS Œ a $2.50 per ADS increase over the proposal announced on September 27.  Tsinghua™s offer included a confidentiality requirement that precluded RDA from immediately disclosing it.  25. On October 28, 2013, RDA sent a draft merger agreement to Tsinghua.   26. That same day, Chen opened, in Wang™s name, a brokerage account at a United States brokerage firm (the ﬁWang accountﬂ).  Chen left blank the portion of the online account application that requested information about Wang™s marital status, and he listed Wang as the only person with trading authority over the account.  When he opened the Wang account, Chen requested the ability to place trades in the account on margin. 27. Despite listing Wang as the sole person with trading authority over the Wang account, Chen had access to and directed all of the trading in that account.  28. Upon opening the Wang account, Chen funded the account with an initial deposit of $17,000. Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 6 of 14   Page ID #:6  COMPLAINT 7   1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829. On October 30, 2013, Tsinghua and RDA personnel met to discuss the potential acquisition. 30. The following day, October 31, Chen sold all of the holdings in a joint brokerage account that he and Wang had opened in 2008 (the ﬁjoint brokerage accountﬂ).  Chen had no prior history trading RDA securities in this account.  Chen sold those holdings for more than $19,000, and transferred the account balance to his and Wang™s joint bank account (the ﬁjoint bank accountﬂ). 31. On November 1, 2013, Chen purchased 270 RDA December 2013 $15 call options in the Wang account for $16,409.  That same day, Chen deposited an additional $18,000 into the Wang account from their joint bank account.   32. On November 6, 2013, Chen purchased, on margin, eight RDA December 2013 $15 call options and 2,300 RDA ADSs at $15.59 per share, for a total of $36,512.   33. Later that day, after the close of trading, RDA publicly announced its receipt of Tsinghua™s previously undisclosed October 25, 2013 offer to acquire RDA for $18 per ADS.  34. The market reacted favorably to the announcement.  The next day, November 7, 2013, the price of RDA ADSs climbed and closed at $17.24, up from RDA™s pre-announcement close of $15.55, a 10.9% increase. 35. That same day, Chen sold all 2,300 of the RDA ADSs he had recently purchased in the Wang account for approximately $39,700, realizing one day profits of $3,852.  Later that day, Chen purchased an additional 86 RDA December 2013 $15 call options for $19,832. 36. On November 11, 2013 at 3:33 a.m. ET, RDA and Tsinghua issued a joint press release announcing the companies™ entry into a definitive merger agreement under which Tsinghua would acquire RDA at a price of $18.50 per ADS Œ an increase of $.50 per ADS over Tsinghua™s previously disclosed offer.  The press release identified Chen as Tsinghua™s ﬁVice President Œ Investmentsﬂ and its contact Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 7 of 14   Page ID #:7  COMPLAINT 8   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728person for questions about the RDA acquisition.   37. RDA and Tsinghua later disclosed in a Commission filing that Chen was a director of a special purpose entity that was created to effectuate the merger and signed the amended merger agreement on behalf of that entity.  Other Commission filings also disclosed that Chen was an official designated by the parties to receive notices regarding the merger agreement. 38. On November 11, 2013, following the press release, Chen sold all 364 RDA December 2013 call options that he had purchased in November 2013, for more than $112,500, realizing a profit of roughly $75,670 on his RDA options trades.  Chen™s illegal trading in RDA securities netted more than $79,520 in profits.  39.  On January 6, 2014, Chen transferred $60,000 from the Wang account to their joint bank account.   Chen™s 58.com Insider Trading 40. By January 2015, 58.com was considering acquiring a large stake in a privately-held rival company, ganji.com (ﬁganjiﬂ), and had retained Chen to assist with the potential acquisition. 41. On January 23, 2015, 58.com and Chen entered into a ﬁfinder™sﬂ agreement regarding the potential ganji acquisition.  In the agreement, 58.com acknowledged that Chen originated and introduced the potential ganji acquisition to 58.com. 42. The finder™s agreement provided that 58.com would pay Chen $5 million in the event 58.com or its affiliates obtained a majority equity interest in ganji.  Should 58.com obtain less than a majority stake in ganji, the agreement provided that Chen would receive a payment from 58.com in an amount to be mutually determined by 58.com and Chen. 43. The finder™s agreement additionally contained a confidentiality clause that committed Chen to maintaining ﬁfull confidentialityﬂ of all information regarding the agreement and the contemplated ganji acquisition.

In early 2015, Chen became a Managing Director at a Hong Kong-based investment banking firm. 45. On March 11, 2015, 58.com engaged Chen™s investment banking firm to advise on its potential acquisition of ganji.  Chen worked on, and was privy to material nonpublic information about, the proposed ganji acquisition.  Chen also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he was required to keep information about the acquisition confidential.   46. As consultants to 58.com, Chen and his investment banking firm were subject to 58.com™s insider trading policies, which expressly prohibited trading based on material nonpublic information related to 58.com. 47. Between March 12 and April 12, 2015, 58.com and the investment banking firm where Chen worked exchanged term sheets with various ganji stakeholders and executives and the parties convened several conference calls and meetings in Beijing to discuss a potential acquisition of ganji.  In a series of meetings that took place from late in the day of April 13, 2015 to the morning of April 14, 2015 (Beijing time), management from 58.com and ganji agreed to a framework for the transaction and to a memorandum of understanding (ﬁMOUﬂ) regarding the acquisition, which was executed on April 14, 2015.   48. The same day 58.com entered the MOU, April 14, 2015, starting at 9:59 a.m. ET (9:59 p.m. Beijing time) through 10:06 a.m. ET (10:06 p.m. Beijing time), Chen used the Wang account to purchase, at a cost of $5,507.68, 100 58.com call options with a strike price of $55 and an expiration date only three days away.  These call options were significantly out of the money.  The day before Chen™s option purchases, 58.com™s shares had closed at $50.83.   49. Chen made these options purchases using nearly the entire cash balance in the Wang account.  Chen had no prior history trading 58.com securities in the joint brokerage account or the Wang account. 50. Less than 30 minutes after Chen made the 58.com options purchases, Case 2:18-cv-07840   Document 1   Filed 09/10/18   Page 9 of 14   Page ID #:9  COMPLAINT 10   12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728Bloomberg News reported that 58.com and ganji had agreed to merge and were expected to announce the deal as early as the following day. 51. Following the reporting on the merger, 58.com™s share price jumped sharply and closed at $67.87 on April 14, 2015, a 33.52% increase over the prior day™s close. 52. Two days later, on April 16, 2015, Chen sold all 100 of his 58.com call options for $99,910.47, realizing insider trading profits of more than $94,400.   53. Chen made no additional trades in the Wang account, but later transferred $100,000 from the Wang account to their joint bank account. 54. Following the announcement of the merger, Chen received a cash payment from 58.com pursuant to the finder™s agreement.  On July 9, 2015, Chen emailed a bank employee in Hong Kong who had inquired about the payment from 58.com.  In the email, Chen wrote that ﬁthe payment is related to a M&A transaction I participated in as the advisor of the acquirer.ﬂ  COUNT I Chen™s RDA Securities Trading in Violation of Exchange Act  Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Thereunder [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] 55.

As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Rong Chen obtained this inside information in the course of his work advising the acquiring companies on these transactions and used an account bearing his wife's name in order to conceal the illicit trades. The SEC also charged Chen's wife, Yuehong Wang, as a relief defendant.According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Chen was Vice President of Investments for Tsinghua Unigroup Limited during its 2014 acquisition of RDA Microelectronics Inc. and learned of the deal before it was announced. The SEC's complaint alleges that shortly before the November 11, 2013 announcement, Chen opened a brokerage account in his wife's name and used that account to make a series of well-timed purchases of RDA securities ahead of the announcement to generate more than $79,500 in trading profits. The SEC further alleges that when Chen later became Managing Director at a Hong Kong-based investment banking firm advising 58.com Inc. on its April 2015 acquisition of rival ganji.com, he again used his wife's brokerage account to commit insider trading, buying high risk 58.com call options, which he sold after news of the acquisition for profits of more than $94,400.The SEC's complaint charges Chen with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, jointly and severally from Chen and Wang plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty from Chen.The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Marcus Fruchter and Amy Flaherty Hartman of the SEC's Cyber Unit in the Chicago Regional Office and David Makol and John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The case has been supervised by Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Kathryn Pyszka, an Associate Regional Director in the Chicago Regional Office.

92,"1  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA CASE NO. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, )    ) Plaintiff, ) v. )    ) OWEN H. NACCARATO, )    ) Defendant. )    )  COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:  INTRODUCTION  1. The Commission brings this action to enjoin Owen H. Naccarato, a California licensed attorney, from further violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. 2. Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (ﬁGlobal Digitalﬂ) engaged Naccarato to provide various securities related legal services. On two instances on September 18, 2013, Naccarato authored opinion letters recommending the removal of restrictive legends from stock certificates for Global Digital representing 2,000,000 shares. These letters inaccurately opined that Global Digital had never been a shell company, that certain shareholders were not affiliates of Global Digital, and that these shareholders™ proposed sales of Global Digital stock complied with the requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ). 3.  As a result, Naccarato instructed Global Digital™s transfer agent to remove the restrictive legends from these shareholder certificates, thus allowing the shares to become free trading and subsequently sold. But for the opinion letters, the transfer agent Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 1 of 9 2  would not have been allowed to issue the stock without a restrictive legend, and thereby facilitated their stock sale. 4. By reason of the foregoing, Naccarato violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c), and should be permanently enjoined from future violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act.  DEFENDANT  5. Naccarato resides in Irvine, California. He is a corporate and securities attorney licensed to practice in the State of California and is the sole partner at Naccarato & Associates. Naccarato™s law practice provides securities related services to companies, often assisting them with matters before the Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). He also has served in various corporate capacities for small public issuers. RELATED PARTY  6. Global Digital is incorporated in New Jersey, with its principal place of business located in West Palm Beach, Florida. Global Digital purports to be in the ﬁcyber arms manufacturingﬂ and ﬁsecurity technology solutionsﬂ industry. Global Digital™s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ). Its stock is quoted on the OTC Link marketplace for trading over-the- counter stocks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker symbol ﬁGDSI.ﬂ Global Digital™s stock is a ﬁpenny stockﬂ under the federal securities laws.  During the relevant time period, Global Digital operated out of a ﬁvirtual officeﬂ and had limited operations, no products, no sales, no revenues, and no assets outside of cash. On August 4, 2016, the Commission brought an action to enjoin Global Digital, its former Chairman and Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 2 of 9 3  CEO, and its former CFO from violating the anti-fraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and against the former Chairman and CEO and former CFO from violating the certification and filing provisions of the federal securities  JURISDICTION AND VENUE  7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d)(1), 20(g), and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1), 77t(g), and 77v(a). 8. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendant, and venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida, because certain of the Defendant™s acts and transactions constituting violations of the Securities Act occurred in the Southern District of Florida. Specifically, Naccarato directed documents and emails to individuals located in the District. In addition, at all relevant times, Global Digital engaged Naccarato as its attorney while having its principal place of business in the Southern District of Florida. 9. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendant, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or the mails. RULE 144 SAFE HARBOR  10. The Securities Act requires that if any person sells a non-exempt security to any other person, the sale must be registered with the Commission absent an applicable exemption. 11. Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act provides one such exemption for a transaction ﬁby any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.ﬂ Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 3 of 9 4  12. An ﬁunderwriter,ﬂ as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, is any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security, or participates, or has a direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking.  13.  Rule 144 of the Securities Act creates a safe harbor from the Section 2(a)(11) definition of ﬁunderwriter.ﬂ A person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of the securities and therefore not an ﬁunderwriterﬂ of the securities for purposes of Section 2(a)(11). Therefore, such a person is deemed not to be an underwriter when determining whether a sale is eligible for the Section 4(a)(1) exemption. 14. Under Rule 144(b)(1)(i), if the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, any person who is not an affiliate of the issuer at the time of the sale, and has not been an affiliate during the preceding three months, who sells restricted securities of the issuer for his or her own account shall be deemed not to be an ﬁunderwriterﬂ of those securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act if all the conditions of certain other provisions in Rule 144 are met. 15. Thus, if a person is not deemed an ﬁaffiliate,ﬂ defined in Rule 144 as a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer, then such person, consistent with the specifications of Rule 144(b)(1)(i), may sell unrestricted securities as that person is not deemed an ﬁunderwriter.ﬂ Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 4 of 9 5  16. Rule 144(i)(1)(ii) states that Rule 144 is not available to securities issued by an issuer that has been ﬁat any time previouslyﬂ a reporting or non-reporting shell company.  Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act define ﬁshell companyﬂ as a company with ﬁ[n]o or nominal operationsﬂ and either [n]o or nominal assets; [a]ssets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or [a]ssets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.ﬂ 17. No other exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act existed for the sales of the Global Digital stock at issue in this Complaint.   DEFENDA NT™S VIOLATIVE CONDUCT   18. On two occasions on September 18, 2013, Naccarato, engaged as Global Digital™s outside counsel during this time, failed to note that Global Digital was a shell company, and failed to note the affiliate status of the requesting shareholders, thus incorrectly deeming them eligible for unlegended shares.  No registration statement was filed or in effect at the time Naccarato authored these opinion letters instructing Global Digital™s transfer agent to issue certificates without restrictive legends in these two instances. But for these opinion letters, Global Digital™s transfer agent would not have issued Global Digital stock certificates without restrictive legends, and the owner of these shares would not have been able to sell them.  A. Naccarato™s First Inaccurate Affiliate Designation  19. On September 18, 2013, Naccarato authored a Rule 144 safe harbor opinion letter removing the restrictive legend from 1,500,000 of Global Digital shares owned by Shareholder A, daughter of Executive X. However, Naccarato knew that Shareholder A was the daughter of Executive X (Global Digital™s then Executive Vice-President) and that the Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 5 of 9 6  shares had been gifted to her from her father. Despite this knowledge, Naccarato authored an opinion letter stating that she was a non-affiliate and complied with Rule 144™s safe harbor provisions. Naccarato never spoke to Shareholder A directly.  Executive X requested and paid for the letter. Days after Naccarato issued this opinion letter, Global Digital sold Shareholder A™s freely transferable shares to raise additional capital for its operations.  Global Digital subsequently issued additional Global Digital stock to Shareholder A to replace the shares sold.  B. Naccarato™s Second Inaccurate Affiliate Designation 20. Also on September 18, 2013, Naccarato authored an opinion letter removing the restrictive legend from 500,000 of Global Digital shares owned by Shareholder B, the 19-year-old son of Executive Y at Global Digital. Naccarato knew Shareholder B was the son of Global Digital™s CEO at the time, and that the stock had been gifted to him by his father. Despite this knowledge, and despite never having spoken to Shareholder B, Naccarato authored an opinion letter, which was virtually identical to the Shareholder A letter, stating that Shareholder B was a non-affiliate and complied with Rule 144™s safe harbor provisions. 21. Days after Naccarato issued this opinion letter Global Digital sold Shareholder B™s freely transferable shares to raise additional capital for its operations. Global Digital subsequently issued additional Global Digital stock to Shareholder B to replace the shares sold. 22. In his two opinion letters, Naccarato inaccurately concluded that the Global Digital shares could be issued without restrictive legends.  Naccarato ignored red flags concerning the shareholders™ likely affiliate status.  The shareholders all controlled or were controlled by Global Digital and its senior executives.  Finally, Global Digital was a shell Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 6 of 9 7  company within the meaning of Rule 144(i) because it operated out of a ﬁvirtual office,ﬂ had limited operations, no products, no sales, no revenues, and nominal assets (consisting solely of cash).  23. Global Digital raised $495,000 from the sale of Shareholder A™s and Shareholder B™s freely transferable shares, as a result of the two inaccurate affiliate designations.  At least one of the purchasers of the shares in this transaction sold the shares without an applicable exemption. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  Violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act  24. The Commission repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 23 of this Complaint. 25. No registration statement was filed or in effect with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to the securities and transactions described in this Complaint and no exemption from registration existed with respect to these securities and transactions. 26. On or about September 18, 2013 the Defendant, a substantial factor and necessary participant in the unregistered sale of Global Digital™s securities, directly and indirectly:  (a) Made use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell securities as described herein, through the use or medium of a prospectus or otherwise;  (b) Carried securities or caused such securities, as described herein, to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or instruments of transportation, for the purpose of sale or delivery after sale; or  (c) Made use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the use or medium of a prospectus or otherwise, as described herein, without a registration statement having been filed or being in effect with the Commission as to such securities. Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 7 of 9 8   27. By reason of the foregoing, Naccarato violated and, unless enjoined, is reasonably likely to continue to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c). RELIEF REQUESTED  WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court:  I.

II.  Civil Penalties  Issue an Order directing Naccarato to pay a civil money penalty pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77t(d). III.  Disgorgement and Prejudgment Interest  Issue an Order directing Naccarato to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, including prejudgment interest, resulting from the acts or courses of conduct alleged in this Complaint. IV.  Professional Legal Services Bar  Issue an Order barring Naccarato, for a period of five years, from directly or indirectly providing, or receiving compensation from the provision of, professional legal services to Case 1:17-cv-24682-JLK   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 12/26/2017   Page 8 of 9 9  any person or entity in connection with the offer or sale of securities pursuant to, or claiming, an exemption under Section 4(1) predicated on Securities Act Rule 144, or any other exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, including, without limitation, participating in the preparation or issuance of any opinion letter related to such offering or sale. V. Further Relief Grant such other further relief as may be necessary and appropriate.   VI. Retention of Jurisdiction Further, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court retain jurisdiction over this action in order to implement and carry out the terms of all orders and decrees that may be entered, or to entertain any suitable application or motion by the Commission for additional relief within the jurisdiction of this Court.

Naccarato for violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.The SEC's complaint alleges that in September 2013, Naccarato issued two opinion letters pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") improperly concluding that Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (""Global Digital""), a Florida-based microcap company, was not a shell company and that certain shareholders were not affiliates of Global Digital. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Naccarato improperly instructed Global Digital's transfer agent to remove the restrictive legends from these shareholder certificates.

70,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  SAN ANTONIO DIVISION SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION,    §  § Plaintiff,§v. §  CASE NO.  §           CHRISTOPHER JAMES LOLLAR §   § Defendant.§COMPLAINT Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), files this Complaint against Christopher James Lollar (ﬁLollarﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ), respectfully alleging the following: SUMMARY 1.This is an insider-trading case involving Defendant Christopher James LollarŠaformer petroleum engineer at Apache Corporation (ﬁApacheﬂ), a Texas-based energy exploration and development company.  Lollar illegally used information learned in the course of his employment to enrich himself by trading ahead of the company™s September 7, 2016 announcement of the discovery of a significant new resource play referred to as the ﬁAlpine Highﬂ (the ﬁAlpine High Announcementﬂ).  In the days and weeks leading to the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar conducted trades in shares and call option contracts in Apache stock that resulted in total profits of $214,295.07. 2.From January 2014 through December 2016, Lollar worked as a petroleumengineer in Apache™s San Antonio office, where the geologic and geophysical work to explore and develop the Alpine High was performed.  In this capacity, he learned inside information Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 1 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 2 of 12 Complaint  about the company™s intention to announce the Alpine High resource play.  After obtaining this material, nonpublic information, Lollar placed, and profited from, illegal trades in shares and call option contracts in Apache stock. 3. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Lollar violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder. 4. The Commission, in the interest of protecting the securities markets from any further unscrupulous and illegal activity, brings this action against Lollar, seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of all illicit trading profits he received, plus accrued prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.   JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. The Commission brings this action under the authority conferred upon it by Sections 21(d) and 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u-1] to enjoin Defendant from further illegal conduct and to seek the imposition of civil penalties. 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21A and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u-1 and 78aa].      7. Defendant has, directly or indirectly, made use of the mails and of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint.   8. Venue is proper in this district because certain of the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred in the Western District of Texas.  Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 2 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 3 of 12 Complaint  DEFENDANT 9. Christopher J. Lollar, age 29, resides in Houston, Texas.  From January 2014 until June 2017, Lollar was a petroleum engineer for Apache Corporation.  From January 2014 through December 2016, he worked in Apache™s San Antonio, Texas office.  In January 2017, Lollar relocated to Apache™s Houston, Texas headquarters where he worked until the company terminated him in June 2017 for breaching its Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   RELATED ENTITY 10. Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.  At all relevant times, Apache™s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ﬁAPA.ﬂ STATEMENT OF FACTS  Lollar Joins Apache as a Petroleum Engineer 11. After interning with Apache during the summers of 2012 and 2013, Lollar went to work for the company full-time in January 2014 as a petroleum engineer in the Petroleum Engineering Development Program.  At the time he made the illegal trades, Lollar worked in the Unconventional Resource Drilling Department (ﬁURD Departmentﬂ) in Apache™s San Antonio office. 12. Upon accepting his internships and full-time position with the company, Lollar acknowledged in writing that he had read, and agreed to abide by, Apache™s corporate codes and policies, including its Code of Business Conduct and Insider Trading Policy.   Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 3 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 4 of 12 Complaint  13. Apache™s Code of Business Conduct prohibited Lollar from ﬁusing corporate property, information or position for personal gain.ﬂ  It also prohibited Lollar from disclosing confidential information and from appropriating such information for his own use.   14. Apache™s Insider Trading Policy prohibited Lollar from trading on material, nonpublic information learned through employment with the company.  The policy included a non-exhaustive list of the type of information the company considers to be material, including ﬁsignificant expansion or curtailment of operationsﬂ and ﬁsignificant new services or discoveries.ﬂ  Apache™s Insider Trading Policy specifically warned Lollar about trading ahead of import newsŠlike the Alpine High AnnouncementŠcautioning that ﬁ[p]erhaps the most dangerous time to engage in a purchase or sale of Apache securities is shortly in advance of a public release of important material information–.ﬂ  Background on Apache™s Decision to Announce the Alpine High 15. From approximately 2014 through mid-2016, Apache worked to develop the Alpine High resource play through extensive geologic and geophysical work, land accumulation, strategic testing and delineation drilling.  On July 14, 2016, Apache personnel gave a presentation on the Alpine High to Apache™s Board of Directors and certain senior executives (the ﬁBoard Presentationﬂ).  A group of seven San Antonio-based engineers and geologists who had worked on developing the Alpine High, and with whom Lollar worked, assisted in the preparation of the Board Presentation.  It was made clear to the employees working on the Board Presentation that the presentation was confidential.  Although Lollar worked with these employees, he did not work on the Board Presentation. 16. After the Board Presentation, Apache made the decision to publicly announce the Alpine High resource play.  Between August 25, 2016 and September 2, 2016, Apache drafted a press release which it planned to issue on September 7, 2016, before the company™s CEO Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 4 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 5 of 12 Complaint  presented at the 2016 Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference (the ﬁBarclays Conferenceﬂ).  Certain company executives, outside financial consultants, and employees specializing in public and investor relations were provided drafts of the press release and the Barclays Conference presentation for their review and comment before both were finalized on September 6, 2016.   17. At 6:40 a.m. (ET), before the markets opened on September 7, 2016, Apache made the Alpine High Announcement.  In response to the news, Apache™s stock traded as high as $58.99 per share on September 7, 2016 before closing at $55.13 per shareŠan approximately 6.7% increase from the prior day™s closing share price of $51.67.  Trading volume that day also increased dramatically to over 14.5 million shares compared with Apache™s historical average daily volume of approximately 2.7 million shares for the month preceding the Alpine High Announcement. Lollar™s Illegal Trading in Apache Securities 18. In the days and weeks following Apache™s decision to announce the Alpine High, Lollar traded Apache securities in two brokerage accounts: (1) his Fidelity Roth IRA account ending 9413 (the ﬁFidelity accountﬂ); and (2) his OptionsHouse account ending 0573 (the ﬁOptionsHouse accountﬂ).   Trading in the Fidelity Account 19. Lollar opened the Fidelity account on February 24, 2016.  There is no evidence that Lollar traded in Apache securities in the Fidelity account prior to August 2016. 20. In August 2016, Lollar sold all of the securities he held in the Fidelity account.  He used the proceeds from that sale, and almost all the cash in the account, to purchase a total of 461 shares of Apache common stock on August 18 and 23, 2016, at a total cost of approximately $24,580.60 (excluding commissions or other transaction fees).  He made these purchases after the Board Presentation and Apache™s decision to publicly announce the Alpine High.  Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 5 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 6 of 12 Complaint  21. On September 9, 2016, two days after the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar sold all 461 shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $26,954.67 and a net profit of $2,374.07.   Trading in the OptionsHouse Account 22. Lollar opened the OptionsHouse account on January 16, 2015.  Prior to September 6, 2016, no Apache securities were traded in the OptionsHouse account.      23. On September 1, 2016, in a recorded telephone call to OptionsHouse™s customer service department, Lollar expressed concern about a notice he received that a $5,000 incoming electronic transfer or deposit request (the ﬁDeposit Requestﬂ) into the OptionsHouse account would not be available until September 8, 2016.  Lollar asked that the Deposit Request be cancelled and that a wire transfer be initiated the next day (September 2, 2016) so that the funds would be available immediately for a trade he wanted to make ﬁon [the] open of next week which would be Tuesday, the 7th [of September].ﬂ1  Lollar was told the Deposit Request was still in progress and that there might be a chance it could be cancelled.   24. OptionsHouse did in fact cancel the Deposit Request.  OptionsHouse account records reflect that $5,000 was deposited in Lollar™s account on September 2, 2016.  An additional $1,200 was wired into Lollar™s OptionsHouse account on September 6, 2016.  That same day, Lollar used the wired funds and existing margin funds to purchase 490 Apache call option contracts in the OptionsHouse account at a cost of approximately $7,275.00.   25. The options had an expiration date of September 9, 2016, and strike prices that varied between $52.50 and $53.50.  Apache™s stock price on September 6, 2016 opened at                                                  1  On this call, Lollar incorrectly stated that the following Tuesday was September 7th.  In fact, he needed the funds available to purchase the three-day options contracts on Tuesday, September 6, 2016, in advance of Apache™s Alpine High Announcement, which took place before the markets opened on Wednesday, September 7, 2016.  The markets were closed on Monday, September 5, 2016, for the Labor Day holiday.   Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 6 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 7 of 12 Complaint  $51.38, had a high of $52.00 and closed at $51.67, thus the three-day options were out-of-the-money when Lollar bought them.  For Lollar™s call options to be in-the-money on September 6, 2016, Apache™s closing stock price would have had to have been higher by between $.84 to $1.84, or 1.6% and 3.7%, respectively, as summarized below: Strike Price No. of Option Contracts Apache Closing Price on 9/6/2016 Min. Increase in  9/6/16 Close  to be in-the-money % Increase  $52.50 35 $51.67 $.84 1.6% $53.00 105 $51.67 $1.34 2.6% $53.50 350 $51.67 $1.84 3.7% 26. As this chart shows, Lollar expected a market moving event to take place in connection with Apache™s stock before September 9, 2016.  Notably, Apache had no earnings or other announcements scheduled between September 6 and 9, 2016.  On September 6, 2016, Apache announced on its Facebook page and LinkedIn account that Apache™s CEO would be making a presentation at the Barclays Conference on September 7, 2016, but no specifics were provided about the content of the presentation.      27. On September 7, 2016, later the same day of the Alpine High Announcement, Lollar sold all 490 Apache call option contracts, resulting in total proceeds of approximately $219,196.00, and profits of approximately $211,921.00.  These profits far exceeded the profits of any of Lollar™s other options trading in the OptionsHouse account since its inception in January 2015. Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 7 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 8 of 12 Complaint  28. Because of the high percentage change in the value of the OptionsHouse account,2 OptionsHouse opened its own internal fraud investigation into Lollar™s trading in Apache securities on September 8, 2016.  OptionsHouse ultimately closed Lollar™s account on September 12, 2016, and he was informed of its decision on September 20, 2016. Summary of Illegal Trading Activity and Profits 29. The following table summarizes Lollar™s trading profits in Apache stock and options (excluding commissions and other transaction fees) during the relevant period: Stock Purchases and Sales (Fidelity Account) Trade Date Buy Quantity (Shares) Sell Quantity (Shares) Share Price Purchase Costs Sales Proceeds Profit 8/18/2016 250  $53.55 $13,380.15  $2,374.07 8/23/2016 211  $53.12 $11,200.45  9/9/2016  (461) $58.47  $26,954.67 TOTAL 461 (461)  $24,580.60 $26,954.67   Call Option Purchases and Sales (OptionsHouse Account) Trade Date Strike Price Buy Quantity  No. of Contracts Sell Quantity No. of Contracts Unit Price Purchase Costs Sales Proceeds Profit 9/6/2016 $52.50 35  $.29 $1,015.00  $211,921.00 9/6/2016 $53.00 105  $.18-$.22 $2,110.00  9/6/2016 $53.50 150  $.11-$.13 $4,150.00  9/7/2016 $52.50  (35) $4.70  $16,450.00 9/7/2016 $53.00  (105) $4.15-$5.58  $51,415.00 9/7/2016 $53.50  (350) $3.27- $4.80  $151,331.00 TOTAL  490 (490)  $7,275.00 $219,196.00   TOTAL COMBINED TRADING PROFITS $214,295.07 Lollar™s Inside Information 30. Lollar had ample opportunity to learn inside information about the impending Alpine High Announcement through his work as a petroleum engineer for Apache.  At the time                                                  2  The value of Lollar™s OptionsHouse account increased by approximately 2,700% between September 6, 2016 (account value of $7,478) and September 7, 2016 (account value of $212,639.41).   Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 8 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 9 of 12 Complaint  he made the illegal trades, Lollar was working in the URD Department in Apache™s San Antonio office where the geologic and geophysical work that went into developing the Alpine High occurred.  In this position, Lollar worked alongside the team of engineers and geologists that were actively working on the development of the Alpine High.  During the course of his employment, Lollar had regular contact with, and access to, many of the engineers and geologists that assisted in preparing the Board Presentation.  He also would have been provided high level information about the development of the Alpine High through staff meetings and daily email reports.  31. In addition to Lollar™s suspiciously timed trades and his access to Apache™s San Antonio-based URD Department, it is clear that Lollar illegally traded based on material, non-public information because:  a. Lollar liquidated all the securities in his Fidelity account and used the proceeds, along with almost all the available cash in the account, to purchase Apache stock shortly before the Alpine High Announcement; b. Lollar used almost all of the available funds in his OptionsHouse account to purchase Apache stock options.  No other securities were held, acquired, or sold in September 2016 in the OptionsHouse account; c. Lollar™s September 1, 2016 telephone call to OptionsHouse revealed that he was concerned about transferring funds into the OptionsHouse account prior to September 6th so he could purchase the call option contracts before the Alpine High Announcement; d. Lollar purchased out-of-the-money call option contracts with a three-day expiration period, evidencing a high degree of confidence in the likely outcome of the trade; Case 5:17-cv-01109   Document 1   Filed 11/01/17   Page 9 of 12 SEC v. Christopher James Lollar  Page 10 of 12 Complaint  e. The accounts in which Lollar made these purchases never maintained a position in Apache securities prior to the subject purchases;  f. When questioned about the trades by Commission staff, Lollar made many statements that were contradicted by information found in the public domain and elsewhere; and  g. Apache terminated Lollar in June 2017 for breaching the company™s Insider Trading Policy and Code of Business Conduct.   32. In short, Lollar was willing to liquidate his Fidelity account to purchase Apache stockŠwhich he had never purchased in that account beforeŠand was willing to bet all of the funds in his OptionsHouse account on a rapid increase in the price of Apache stock in just a three-day time frame.  He was only willing to make this bet because of the inside information he had obtainedŠthat Apache was about to make a major public announcement about the Alpine High play.  He then used that inside information to make illegal insider trades and realized substantial profits as a result.

2,"1  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,   Civil Action No. 18-6854 v.    Mark Suleymanov    Defendant.      Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ) files this Complaint against Defendant Mark Suleymanov (ﬁSuleymanovﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ), and alleges as follows: SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS 1. Between at least early 2012 and early 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of binary options securities over the internet. Suleymanov, who was doing business as SpotFN and a number of other brands, raised at least $4 million from retail investors, some of whom were senior citizens without investment experience. As a result of the scheme, investors suffered losses, including losses of retirement funds, which SpotFN encouraged investors to use. 2. Suleymanov operated a SpotFN website and other related websites, which misrepresented the profitability of investing in binary options using SpotFN™s platform, as well as investors™ ability to access their funds. In reality, Suleymanov used software to manipulate investors™ trading results to increase investor losses. In addition, Suleymanov caused many investors to be unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds.    Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 1 of 12 PageID #: 1 2  3.  The SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor™s funds would be held in a segregated account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN™s business expenses. In fact, investors™ funds were commingled in bank accounts controlled by Suleymanov, who misused certain investor funds for both business and personal expenses.  4. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Suleymanov violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder, and the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e(a) and 77e(c)] and unless restrained and enjoined will again engage in violations of these provisions. 5. The Commission seeks an order enjoining Suleymanov from further violations, requiring Suleymanov to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing monetary penalties. JURSIDICTION AND VENUE 6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa]. 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa]. 8. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, used the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, and courses of business described in this Complaint.  Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 2 3  9. Venue is appropriate in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because certain of the offers and sales of securities, and acts and transactions constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint, occurred in the Eastern District of New York, and Suleymanov resides and transacts business in the District.  DEFENDANT 10. Mark Suleymanov, age 38, is a resident of Glen Cove, New York. Suleymanov did business as SpotFN, an unincorporated entity offering and selling binary options over the internet. Suleymanov established the SpotFN.com website, as well as related websites such as BinaryAcademics.com, AssetSignals.com, BinaryFN.com, and OptionsMogul.com, among others. He opened and controlled bank accounts to which investors sent their money. Suleymanov also controlled the risk settings on software that caused investors to lose money they had invested in SpotFN binary options.    FACTS Suleymanov Created a SpotFN Website, and Related Websites, to Sell Binary Options Securities  11. Between at least early 2012 and early 2016, Suleymanov offered and sold binary options securities to customers throughout the United States through a number of different public websites, including SpotFN.com, BinaryFN.com, and OptionsMogul.com, among others (collectively, ﬁSpotFNﬂ). Each of these web domains was registered to and controlled by Suleymanov. The SpotFN web domains included BinaryAcademics.com, which purported to sell educational materials that would supposedly improve an investor™s performance, and AssetSignals.com, which purported to sell trading ﬁsignals,ﬂ or tips on market movements, that would also supposedly improve investors™ trading results. Via these ﬁeducationalﬂ sites, Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 3 4  Suleymanov encouraged investors to make more trades on the SpotFN platform, which resulted in investors incurring more losses.  12. The SpotFN binary options were options contracts of short duration that were based on the price of stocks and stock indexes, or other financial assets. A binary option™s payout depended on the outcome of a ﬁyes/noﬂ proposition. For example, SpotFN offered and sold binary options in which an investor would choose whether a given stock™s price would be above or below a specified price at a specified time. When the option expired, the investor would either earn a pre-determined amount if he chose correctly, or he would earn nothing and forfeit the amount of his investment if he chose incorrectly. Binary options are securities within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act when they take the form of options based on the value of a security or index of securities.  13. Investor funds were sent, either by wire or via credit card processors, into bank accounts that had been opened and were controlled by Suleymanov. Suleymanov received approximately $4 million in investor funds through these accounts.  14. Suleymanov caused SpotFN™s website to falsely represent that SpotFN was a legitimate incorporated entity with officers and directors, when in fact, for most of its existence, it was not. Suleymanov also caused SpotFN™s website to misleadingly feature the NASDAQ logo, despite the fact that SpotFN™s binary options were not traded on NASDAQ or any other regulated exchange.  Unregistered Offers and Sales of SpotFN Binary Options 15. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77e], it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to offer or sell securities using the U.S. mails or interstate commerce, unless (1) the offer or sale is registered with the SEC pursuant to a valid registration statement Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4 5  that applies to that specific offering; or (2) the offer or sale is specifically exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5.  16. No registration statement was filed or in effect as to the offer and sale of binary options through the SpotFN websites. In addition, no exemption from the registration requirement applied. Suleymanov directly sold the securities via SpotFN, creating and maintaining the websites through which the securities were offered and sold. Suleymanov Made Material Misrepresentations and Engaged in a Fraudulent Scheme  A. Suleymanov Misrepresented that Binary Options Trading Would Be Profitable  17. On the SpotFN websites, Suleymanov made false statements about the significant and sustainable profits that investors could expect from trading binary options using SpotFN™s platform, and about SpotFN™s motivation to have clients™ trading be successful. For example, the SpotFN.com website stated:   ﬁUp to 88% Return.ﬂ   ﬁ[Clients] will be able to have their investment account become a self-sufficient, lifelong source of funds accessible when needed at any time.ﬂ   ﬁThe final result is to have clients be able to withdraw on a consistent basis, without affecting their ever-growing account balance.ﬂ  ﬁAt SpotFN, we want our clients to be able to attain a constant source of income.ﬂ   ﬁWe are looking to create longstanding sustainability for our clients that will be shown by the growth of their portfolios.ﬂ    ﬁWe are highly motivated to make our clients as successful as possible in trading for the very reason that your success is our success.ﬂ  18. These statements were materially false and misleading because Suleymanov in fact caused losses for investors. In contrast to the ﬁup to 88% returnﬂ that the site touted, many investors ultimately lost all, or nearly all, of their invested capital. One investor™s account experienced an ultimate win rate of only 38%, resulting in the loss of his entire account balance. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 5 6  Other investors experienced similarly dismal results, with the same ultimate outcome: depleted accounts, no matter how much they invested. B. Suleymanov Engaged in Deceptive Conduct to Cause Losses for Investors 19. As part of a scheme, Suleymanov engaged in deceptive conduct to cause losses for investors. One way that he achieved this was through the SpotFN trading model. The trading model worked in the following way: when investors placed a losing trade, they forfeited 100% of the amount of that trade. When they placed a winning trade, they typically received 70-80% of the amount of the trade. Because the amount of a loss was larger than the amount of a gain, on average, assuming a 50% win rate, an account would cumulatively lose value the more it was traded.   20. In addition, Suleymanov used a restrictive withdrawal policy to encourage SpotFN customers to place a large volume of trades which would lead to more losses. Although the website stated that the client™s success meant SpotFN™s success, the truth was just the opposite. The funds that the customers lost, SpotFN gained.  21. Suleymanov also acted behind the scenes and used software to manipulate the rates at which customers won or lost trades. Suleymanov admitted in a February 2016 email to the company that sold him the software that he used it to give new customers high rates of winning trades initially to encourage them to invest more funds, then he adjusted the setting so the investors would experience losses. Suleymanov stated:  ﬁWe use that as a marketing tool to lure customers in for the first time, get them to deposit as much as possible, let them win– then once all their funds and wires come in, we then turn that feature into a positive for the platform. –We are controlling the situation with them. The wins are their way of bringing in the funds to the company. We discussed this– that clients will be given bonuses in the beginning to see how easy they can win. But again, once the funds are in, that setting gets adjusted to a loss for them. This is not our first day at the park with this.ﬂ  Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 6 7  C. Suleymanov Falsely Promised Investors Easy Access to Their Funds 22. Suleymanov caused the SpotFN websites to promise investors ﬁhassle free withdrawalsﬂ that were ﬁfast and secure.ﬂ One of SpotFN™s selling points was that investments would generate profits that would be ﬁaccessible when needed anytime.ﬂ In reality, however, Suleymanov caused many investors to be unable to withdraw any significant amount of their funds. 23. Suleymanov™s primary technique for retaining investors™ money was SpotFN™s so-called bonus policy. When investors opened accounts, SpotFN frequently credited them with ﬁaccount bonuses,ﬂ credits which increased an investor™s trading account balance beyond what he had personally funded. In some cases, investors recalled being offered these bonuses as an inducement to fund a certain amount into their accounts, but in other cases, investors simply discovered that the amounts had been added without their consent. Investors were not warned that the bonus money came with consequences: that every bonus dollar in an account had to be traded thirty times before SpotFN would approve any withdrawal request from that account. When an investor placed a withdrawal request for funds from his account, SpotFN would often cancel the request, citing this policy. 24. Some investors increased the volume of trading in their accounts, in order to be eligible for cash withdrawals. However, increased trading volume meant that the investors™ account balances depleted quickly as a result of trading losses.  25. Some investors received other excuses as to why their requested withdrawals never arrived. These excuses ran the gamut from supposed bank errors, to computer failures, to frozen accounting software, to accidental misrouting to the wrong account. A few investors did receive some amount of withdrawal or refund, after the investor threatened to pursue a fraud claim or charge-back against SpotFN with their bank or credit card company. Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 7 8  26. The SpotFN websites are no longer operational. Once the websites were removed from the internet in early 2016, investors found that their telephone calls and emails to SpotFN were no longer answered. Since investors™ only access to their accounts had been through the SpotFN websites, all ability for investors to access or view their account balances, trade or transaction history, or any other data, vanished along with the site. There was no advance warning that SpotFN would be going out of business, and no procedure for investors to get refunds of the balances in their accounts.  D. Suleymanov Misrepresented That Investors™ Funds Were Held in Segregated Accounts and Used Only for Trading Binary Options  27. Suleymanov caused the SpotFN website to state that: ﬁUpon receipt of your deposit(s), SpotFN will place your trading capital into one or more segregated client account(s).ﬂ The website stated that the funds could not be used in the course of SpotFN™s business, adding, ﬁFunds are used only for trading options through our website upon client™s instructions and are never used for any other cause.ﬂ The website also stated, ﬁSpotFN™s Compliance Department ensures that your deposited funds and trading profits are secure,ﬂ adding that ﬁthe Compliance department specializes in combating fraud and money laundering, ensuring that your funds are always protected.ﬂ  28. Contrary to these representations, SpotFN did not have a Compliance Department, and investors™ funds were not placed into segregated accounts. When investors transferred money to SpotFN to fund their SpotFN trading accounts, their money was actually commingled in several bank accounts that were opened and controlled by Suleymanov. This was material because investors™ funds were not used as represented; the funds were not secure or protected as promised; and Suleymanov had access to investors™ funds to use for his own purposes, which was not disclosed to the investors.  Case 2:18-cv-06854   Document 1   Filed 12/03/18   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8 9  E. Suleymanov Misused Investor Funds  29. Suleymanov misused certain investor funds. Instead of ensuring that investors™ funds were used only for the trading of options as the SpotFN website had claimed, Suleymanov used some of these funds to pay business expenses, such as the payment of salary and other compensation to employees, as well as personal expenses, such as payments on his personal mortgage. In addition, Suleymanov wrote checks from these accounts to his family members, and made transfers from these accounts to other business entities that he controlled, ultimately draining each account of funds.

Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds. Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds. As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses. In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses.The SEC's complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty. Suleymanov has agreed to a bifurcated settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from these provisions. The settlement, which is subject to Court approval, reserves the issues of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Shioji and supervised by Lisa Deitch, Cheryl Crumpton, and Antonia Chion.

79,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ATLANTA DIVISION    SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,    v.  Case No.  JUN YING,   Defendant.  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED      COMPLAINT  Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁCommissionﬂ), files its complaint and alleges that: SUMMARY  1. Defendant Jun Ying (ﬁYingﬂ) committed securities fraud by engaging in illegal insider trading.  After being entrusted with material, nonpublic information about a massive cyber-intrusion and data breach suffered by his employer, Equifax Inc. (ﬁEquifaxﬂ or ﬁthe companyﬂ), Ying exercised all his vested Equifax stock options and sold the shares prior to the public announcement of the breach.  By selling when he did, Ying avoided losses in excess of $117,000. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 1 of 19 2  2. By the conduct detailed in this Complaint, Ying violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.  Unless enjoined, Ying is likely to commit such violations again in the future. 3. The Commission seeks a judgment from the Court: (a) enjoining Ying from engaging in future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; (b) ordering Ying to disgorge an amount equal to the losses avoided as a result of the actions described herein, with prejudgment interest; (c) ordering Ying to pay a civil monetary penalty pursuant to Section 21A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u-1]; and (d) prohibiting Ying from serving as an officer or director of a public company. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Section 21(d) the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)]. 5. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)], and Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 2 of 19 3  Sections 21(d), 21(e), 21A and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), 78u-1, and 78aa]. 6. Ying, directly or indirectly, used the means or instruments of interstate commerce, the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts described herein. 7. Venue is proper under Section 22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] and 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims made herein occurred in the Northern District of Georgia.  In addition, Ying currently resides in the Northern District of Georgia. DEFENDANT 8. Jun Ying, age 42, is a resident of Atlanta, Georgia.  He was an employee of Equifax Inc. from January 2013 until October 2017, and was the Chief Information Officer (ﬁCIOﬂ) of Equifax™s United States Information Systems (ﬁUSISﬂ) business unit at the time of his departure.  At the time of the Equifax breach, Ying was a leading candidate to succeed the then-current global CIO of Equifax, and was, in fact, offered the job on September 15, 2017.  As CIO of USIS, Ying was often entrusted with nonpublic information about Equifax.  Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 3 of 19 4  OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY 9. Equifax Inc., an information solutions and human resources company, is a Georgia corporation headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.  Equifax™s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ﬁEFX.ﬂ  Equifax is one of three major consumer credit bureaus that collect and maintain a vast amount of consumer credit information for the purpose of offering credit and demographic data and services. STATEMENT OF FACTS I. THE EQUIFAX CYBERSECURITY BREACH. 10. On July 29, 2017, Equifax™s security department observed suspicious network traffic associated with the company™s consumer dispute portal, which is a part of Equifax™s website where consumers dispute items on their credit reports. 11. In response, the security department immediately blocked the suspicious traffic and continued to monitor the network.  The next day, after observing additional suspicious activity, the security department took the portal offline. 12. On August 2, 2017, Equifax retained the cybersecurity group at an Atlanta law firm to investigate the incident and provide legal and regulatory advice.  That same day, Equifax, through the law firm, engaged an independent cybersecurity forensic consulting firm. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 4 of 19 5  13. Over the next several weeks, the cybersecurity forensic consulting firm and Equifax™s internal security department analyzed forensic data to determine the nature and scope of the suspicious activity.  It was determined that Equifax had been subject to cyber-intrusions that resulted in a breach of Equifax™s information technology (ﬁITﬂ) systems. 14. In accordance with Equifax™s internal policies, the company classified the breach as a ﬁcritical incidentﬂ and formed a crisis action team, comprised of security, legal, and IT personnel. 15. The company designated the response to the breach as ﬁProject Sierra,ﬂ and instructed those working on Project Sierra that information related to the project was confidential and should not be shared with anyone outside of Equifax™s crisis action team. 16. The forensic investigators determined that, in connection with the breach, it was likely that sensitive data, including consumers™ personally identifiable information (ﬁPIIﬂ), had been stolen.  Equifax then instituted a special trading blackout period for those working on Project Sierra.  Trading blackout periods are typically implemented pursuant to a company™s insider trading policy to prevent trading by insiders when significant events or changes are taking place within the company. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 5 of 19 6  17. As part of its response to the breach, Equifax also deployed additional security measures to protect the company™s network.  For example, between August 12 and 15, 2017, Project Sierra team members changed administrative credentials for hundreds of internal databases.  The so-called ﬁpassword resetﬂ required the assistance of a broader group of Equifax IT employees who were not informed of the breach. 18. Equifax also established a notification and remediation plan for the millions of consumers affected by the breach.  This effort, which the company designated ﬁProject Sparta,ﬂ involved setting up a website for consumers to determine whether they were affected by the breach, developing a suite of protective tools for consumers, and staffing call centers. 19. Project Sparta was kept separate from Project Sierra to limit the number of people who knew that Equifax itself had been breached.  Those Equifax employees who were only part of Project Sparta were not told that Equifax had been breached, but were instead told that they were working for an unnamed client that had experienced a large data breach. 20. The company decided to handle much of the work for Project Sparta through its own Global Consumer Solutions business unit (ﬁGCSﬂ), which developed and Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 6 of 19 7  sold various personal security and identity theft defense products and services to clients. 21. On August 23, 2017, one of Ying™s peers, the CIO of another Equifax business unit, was informed of the breach.  He was also asked to lead the notification and remediation efforts that composed Project Sparta. 22. Ying was not informed of Project Sierra or Project Sparta at that time, nor was he made aware of his colleague™s appointment to lead the soon-to-be implemented notification and remediation efforts. II. YING IS ENTRUSTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE BREACH.  23. At 2:22 p.m. on Friday, August 25, 2017, as part of Project Sparta, an email was sent to several Equifax IT personnel who were responsible for the systems that would handle the breach remediation efforts, as well as the CIOs of certain business units.  Ying was among the CIOs included. 24. The email stated that GCS was working on a ﬁVERY large breach opportunityﬂ that required a dramatic increase in the capacity of the relevant technology systems, and that this was ﬁan extremely time sensitive request,ﬂ with a deadline of August 29, 2017. 25. Ying initially instructed his direct reports not to work on the project until they received additional information. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 7 of 19 8  26. At 4:33 p.m. that afternoon, Ying (among other IT personnel, including several of his direct reports) received a calendar appointment invitation for a conference call at 4:45 p.m. with the subject, ﬁURGENT / MANDATORY MEETING Œ Breach Opportunity.ﬂ  The invitation stated that Equifax™s global CIO for all company operations, who was Ying™s immediate supervisor, wanted the group to get ﬁonboard on this ASAP,ﬂ and that participants should prepare the IT applications under their care to handle approximately 10 million customers.   27. Ying did not initially participate in the conference call, but an IT employee who reported directly to Ying was on the call.  During the call, Ying and his direct report exchanged text messages in which the direct report informed Ying that Ying™s team would have to cancel their Friday evening plans to respond to the Project Sparta requests. 28. Ying then joined the conference call, and initially resisted the requests for assistance.  He also expressed concern that the deadline was unrealistic.  In response, the leader of Project Sparta instructed Ying to call the global CIO with his concerns. III. YING CONCLUDES THAT EQUIFAX WAS THE REAL VICTIM OF THE BREACH. 29. At 5:26 p.m., Ying called the global CIO.  The call lasted only one minute. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 8 of 19 9  30. During the call, the global CIO told Ying that Ying was expected to comply with the requests.  The global CIO also told Ying that, at that time, Ying did not need to know why he had to comply, but that at some point, Ying would understand what was happening. 31. At 5:27 p.m., Ying texted the direct report he had communicated with earlier, writing:  ﬁOn the phone with [global CIO].  Sounds bad.  We may be the one breached. . . . Starting to put 2 and 2 together.ﬂ 32. After that call, Ying™s demeanor towards the requests for assistance changed.  Just three minutes later, at 5:30 p.m., the Project Sparta leader texted Ying to ask whether Ying had any questions after speaking to the global CIO.  Ying responded, ﬁNo question right now. Actually, I don™t want to know ;) I told the team to [rally].ﬂ  Ying™s team began responding to the requests for assistance. 33. Numerous additional communications the evening of August 25, 2017, informed Ying that this breach was unusual, and indicate that Ying used the information entrusted to him as an Equifax employee to conclude that Equifax was the victim of the breach, and that the ﬁbreach opportunityﬂ idea suggesting a client was the victim was merely a cover story. 34. At 5:34 p.m., Ying called Equifax™s global CIO again, and the two discussed the fact that the breach response plan, which called for offering credit bureau Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 9 of 19 10  reports from all three credit bureaus to 50 million consumers, would be highly unusual and would strain the company™s resources. 35. At 5:50 p.m., Ying exchanged text messages with the same direct report he had texted with earlier that afternoon.  In the texts, both men expressed that the breach situation was ﬁcrazy,ﬂ and Ying stated that the company had ﬁsome crisis scenarios like this,ﬂ referencing Equifax™s Crisis Management Plan, which, among other things, provided a plan for responding to a breach of Equifax™s systems. 36. In fact, as part of the company™s training in support of the Crisis Management Plan, Ying previously had participated in a simulated crisis scenario in which Equifax™s CIO was unavailable following a cybersecurity breach, and Ying was asked to step into the role of CIO for purposes of formulating a response. 37. At 6:19 p.m., another IT employee who reported to Ying emailed Ying regarding a series of meetings (unrelated to the breach) that were scheduled for the week of August 28, 2017, and were to take place in different states.  These meetings were to include executives from Equifax™s IT, Legal, and Security departments, as well as their counterparts at certain major retailers, and related to the business relationships between Equifax and the retailers. 38. The IT employee informed Ying that a number of senior leadership members, including the global CIO and the leader of Project Sparta, as well as Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 10 of 19 11  Equifax™s Chief Security Officer (ﬁCSOﬂ), Chief Legal Officer, and VP of Cybersecurity, were cancelling their travel plans. 39. Ying confirmed the cancellations, and, in his reply emails, stated ﬁI think you now know why.ﬂ  He also stated that he thought the travel cancellations were ﬁrelated to all the mad scrambling . . . .ﬂ 40. At 8:55 p.m., yet another IT employee who reported to Ying forwarded Ying emails from Equifax™s Senior Director of Crisis Management asking for log files for a specific database.  The employee told Ying that he had concerns about producing the files to security and was unsure whether this related to the breach opportunity that was discussed on the earlier conference call. 41. At 8;59 p.m., Ying responded: ﬁYup. Cooperate.ﬂ  At this point, the securities market had been closed for several hours, and would not reopen until Monday morning, August 28, 2017. 42. At approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian™s stock price.  The search terms used by Ying were: (1) ﬁExperian breachﬂ; (2) ﬁExperian stock price 9/15/2015ﬂ; and (3) ﬁExperian breach 2015.ﬂ Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 11 of 19 12  43. These searches yielded results revealing that, although the breach at Experian was much smaller than the one that Equifax faced, the public announcement of Experian™s breach negatively impacted that company™s stock price.  Ying™s internet browsing history indicates that Ying reviewed market data showing that Experian™s stock price dropped approximately four percent after the public announcement of the breach. 44. By no later than 10:00 a.m. on August 28, 2017, based on nonpublic information entrusted to him by his employer, Equifax, Ying had concluded that Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach, despite the statements made as part of Project Sparta asserting that it was a business opportunity for an unnamed client. 45. Ying owed a duty of trust and confidence to Equifax and its shareholders not to trade on the basis of material nonpublic information that he learned through his employment with Equifax, and was aware of his duty. 46. Ying knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was material.  47. Ying knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was nonpublic.  Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 12 of 19 13  IV. YING™S TRADING IN EQUIFAX SECURITIES. 48. Ying received a portion of his compensation through stock option grants and restricted shares.  While Ying had exercised some of his options previously, as of October 1, 2016, Ying held 6,815 vested options, which he continued to hold until August 28, 2017. 49. Within an hour of running the internet searches regarding the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, Ying accessed his company-sponsored stock plan account with UBS Financial Services, Inc., exercised all of his vested options to buy Equifax shares, and then immediately sold those Equifax shares for total proceeds of more than $950,000.   50. These securities transactions were made on the basis of material nonpublic information and breached the duty of trust and confidence that Ying owed to Equifax and its shareholders.  Ying knew or was reckless in not knowing that the information that Equifax itself was the victim of a major cybersecurity breach was material and nonpublic, and Ying used that information when making these securities transactions.   51. By selling Equifax shares before its cybersecurity breach was publicly disclosed, Ying avoided more than $117,000 in losses that he would have suffered had he not sold until after the news of the breach became public.   Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 13 of 19 14  52. Ying™s trading on the basis of material nonpublic information entrusted to him by Equifax was deceptive and fraudulent. V. YING IS OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED OF THE EQUIFAX BREACH. 53. On August 29, 2017, the day after exercising his options and selling Equifax shares, Ying was traveling for business when he was unexpectedly called back to Atlanta by Equifax™s global CIO.  The global CIO did not tell Ying why he needed him to return. 54. Shortly after receiving instructions to return to Atlanta, Ying sent a text message to a work colleague at Equifax.  Among other things, Ying™s text told the colleague that he thought there was going to be ﬁsome big media announcementﬂ about Equifax, that ﬁit might be bad,ﬂ and that it was why ﬁeveryone was cancelling trips this week and even next.ﬂ 55. On August 30, 2017, Ying was back in Atlanta.  The global CIO for Equifax officially told Ying that Equifax was the entity that had been breached.  Ying then met with one of the attorneys engaged by Equifax, who confirmed for Ying what the global CIO had said, and gave him a set of instructions and directions that had been developed for that situation, i.e., when an Equifax employee was told that Equifax was the entity that had been breached.  After receiving the instructions and directions, such employees then became part of the Project Sierra team. Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 14 of 19 15  56. Unaware that Ying had already traded, the attorney told Ying that the news about the breach was confidential, should not be shared with anyone, and that Ying should not trade in Equifax securities.  Ying did not volunteer the fact that he had exercised and sold all of his vested Equifax options two days before. VI. EQUIFAX TELLS THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE BREACH. 57. After the close of the market on September 7, 2017, Equifax issued a press release and filed a Form 8-K with the Commission, announcing the cybersecurity breach and revealing that it potentially impacted approximately 143 million consumers in the United States. 58. The breach was one of the leading news stories over the next several days and was described as ﬁone of the worst [data breaches] ever, by its reach and by the kind of information exposed to the public.ﬂ 59. On September 8, the price of Equifax common stock closed at $123.23, a drop of $19.49 (nearly 14%) per share from the prior day™s closing price of $142.72.  Trading volume that day also increased dramatically to nearly seventeen million shares, more than a thirty-fold increase from the previous day™s volume of approximately 518,000 shares. 60. On September 15, 2017, following the resignation of the then-current global CIO, Ying was offered the position of global CIO of Equifax.  The offer was Case 1:18-cv-01069-CAP   Document 1   Filed 03/14/18   Page 15 of 19 16  subsequently withdrawn, however, after Equifax senior executives learned of Ying™s trading. 61. On October 16, 2017, following an internal Equifax investigation into Ying™s trading, the company concluded that he had violated the company™s insider trading policy and that his employment should be terminated.  At that time, Ying agreed to resign.

18,"SEC v. Caufield         Page 1 Complaint IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS DALLAS DIVISION                  § SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, §         § Plaintiff,      §         § v.        § Case No. __________            §  THOMAS J. CAUFIELD,     §         §   Defendant.      §         §  COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ), for its Complaint against Defendant Thomas J. Caufield (ﬁCaufieldﬂ), alleges: SUMMARY 1. From at least as early as 2013 through 2017, Defendant Thomas J. Caufield convinced investorsŠincluding his advisory clientsŠto invest more than $6 million in his high-yield promissory notes by misrepresenting key aspects of the offering.  Caufield represented that he would use investor funds to acquire and operate a franchise that offered investment education programs.  Instead, he used a large portion of the funds for other purposesŠincluding paying returns to earlier investors and paying past-due franchise expenses.  He also misled investors about the franchise™s financial condition and the safety of the investments.  The investor victims included both students of the franchise and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC (ﬁDAT Capitalﬂ)Ša former state-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield. 2. Caufield conducted his offering through a collection of entities he wholly owned and controlled.  These entities offered and sold the notes, which promised 10%-18% annual                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 1 of 11   PageID 1 SEC v. Caufield         Page 2 Complaint returns.  Caufield used a combination of verbal pitches and written offering materials to solicit investors, falsely portraying the investment as lucrative and safe.  He did not disclose that: (1) the franchise routinely failed to meet its current financial obligations; (2) the notes were not secured by the franchise™s business assets, as claimed; and (3) investor funds would be used to pay his obligations on the prior, past-due notes.  Additionally, Caufield did not register the offering with the SEC as required. 3. By engaging in this conduct, Caufield violated the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  He also violated the fiduciary duties he owed to his advisory clients.  In the interest of protecting the public from any further violations of the federal securities laws, the SEC brings this action.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The SEC brings this action under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (ﬁSecurities Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)], Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], and Section 209(d) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)] seeking to permanently restrain and enjoin Caufield from engaging in the unlawful acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein. 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)], Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], and Section 214(a) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14]. 6. The Defendant, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails or of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, or courses of business described in this Complaint.                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 2 of 11   PageID 2 SEC v. Caufield         Page 3 Complaint 7. Venue is proper because the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business described below occurred within the jurisdiction of the Northern District of Texas. PARTIES 8. Plaintiff SEC is an agency of the United States of America charged with enforcing the federal securities laws. 9. Defendant Caufield, age 59, resides in Colleyville, Texas.  Caufield started in the securities industry in 1984 as a registered broker-dealer representative and worked in the securities industry in various capacities until 2015.  Although not presently registered with the SEC or associated with a regulated entity, Caufield was the sole associated person, operator, and owner of DAT CapitalŠa state-registered investment adviser from 2008 to 2015.  During the offering, Caufield operated the franchise out of Irving, Texas and Frisco, Texas. FACTS A. Caufield acted as an investment adviser. 10. For more than 30 years, Caufield worked in the securities industry in various capacities.  In 2008, he established DAT CapitalŠwhich was registered as an investment adviser in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Texas.  Through DAT Capital, Caufield provided investment advisory servicesŠincluding recommending investments in different securities.  He provided these services for a fee, which was based on the amount of client assets under management.  Caufield managed as much as $13 million in client assets as part of his advisory business. 11. As an investment adviser, Caufield was a fiduciary to his clients.  Consequently, he had a fundamental obligation to act in his clients™ best interests and to provide investment advice that was in their best interests.  He also owed his clients a duty of undivided loyalty and                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 3 of 11   PageID 3 SEC v. Caufield         Page 4 Complaint utmost good faith.  Finally, he was required to employ reasonable care to avoid misleading his clients and to provide them full and fair disclosure of all material facts. B. Caufield offered unregistered securities. 12. In 2011, Caufield sought to expand his business activities and entered into discussions with a franchisor about purchasing its Dallas, Texas based franchise.  The franchisor and its franchises were in the business of providing investment education classes.  Caufield ultimately acquired the franchise later that year.   13. After that, from at least as early as 2013 until 2017, Caufield coordinated a series of integrated securities offerings to raise capitalŠpurportedly to finance and operate the franchise.  In these offerings, he offered high-yield notes with annual interest rates ranging from 10% to 18%.  The maturities on the notes ranged from 60 days to 24 months.  These offerings, which were not limited to accredited investors,1 were not registered with the SEC. 14. These offerings were an integrated offering, since they shared a number of key characteristics: (1) Caufield controlled the operations of each of the note issuers and their bank accounts and facilitated the transfer of funds between the issuers and the franchise; (2) Caufield did not take any steps to verify whether the investors were accredited; (3) Caufield represented that franchise revenues would be used to repay investors; (4) Caufield represented that investor funds would be used to pay the expenses of acquiring and operating the franchise; (5) Caufield represented that each note would be secured by franchise assets; and (6) Caufield portrayed the franchise as a financially successful business venture.                                                  1 An accredited investor is high-net-worth and/or sophisticated investor, as defined by the relevant statutes, rules, and regulations.                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 4 of 11   PageID 4 SEC v. Caufield         Page 5 Complaint 15. Between 2013 and 2017, Caufield raised approximately $6.8 million through the integrated securities offering.  He received investments from more than 30 investorsŠincluding his advisory clients, to whom he recommended the investments. C. Caufield made material misrepresentations in connection with the securities offering. 16. Caufield marketed the notes through both verbal presentations and written materials.  When doing so, he misled investors regarding the financial condition of the franchise and the risks of the notes. 17. As Caufield knew as its owner and operator, the franchise was strained financially throughout the time of the offering.  It was not generating sufficient revenue to pay its current liabilities.  As a result, the franchise could only stay afloat by using proceeds from the offeringŠrather than business revenuesŠto pay these liabilities. 18. For example, Caufield knew that the franchise was regularly delinquent in its franchise payments to the franchisor.  This resulted in the franchise violating the terms of the franchise agreement, which jeopardized Caufield™s ownership of the franchise.  Caufield cured these delinquencies by using incoming investor funds from the offering to pay the past-due obligations.  On at least six occasions, Caufield used a total of $368,362.31 in investor funds to pay the franchise™s obligations to the franchisor. 19. Despite the franchise™s strained financial condition, Caufield touted its supposed financial success when offering the notes to prospective investors.  In both written offering materials distributed to investors and verbal pitches, Caufield claimed that the franchise was a profitable and financially successful enterpriseŠeven though it was not. 20. Caufield also sometimes included unaudited financial information for the franchise in his written offering materialsŠincluding a profit-and-loss statement and facts on                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 5 of 11   PageID 5 SEC v. Caufield         Page 6 Complaint student enrollment and tuition.  This financial information was misleading because it portrayed the franchise to be financially successful.  It did not disclose important information regarding the franchise™s liabilities, including details about the millions of dollars in notes payable from the offering. 21. Caufield also representedŠboth verbally and in writingŠthat the notes were secured by the franchise™s assets.  In reality, however, Caufield never caused the franchise, or any of the entities he controlled, to file a financing statement in favor of the investors.  Nor did he ever cause the franchise to segregate proceeds for the purpose of repaying the notes.  Therefore, in reality, the notes were completely unsecured. D. Caufield misapplied investor funds in order to keep the franchise afloat and to pay promised returns on the notes. 22. Due to the franchise™s strained financial condition, Caufield deceptively misapplied investor funds to keep it afloat.  He also failed to disclose this deceptive conduct to investors.   23. Caufield represented that: (1) he would use investor funds to finance franchise operations (typically advertising campaigns or expansion and relocation expenses); and (2) he would use franchise operating revenues (not funds from other investors) to repay investors.  However, as the controller of the bank accounts, he did not actually do this.  In realityŠsince the franchise was failing financially, as detailed aboveŠCaufield resorted to misapplying investor funds both to pay unauthorized business expenses and to pay the promised investment returns.                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 6 of 11   PageID 6 SEC v. Caufield         Page 7 Complaint E. Funds were repaid to investors through payments from later investors and the sale of the franchise. 24. From 2013 to 2017, Caufield raised $6,762,031.37 from investors while returning $6,147,216.23 to them.  This left a shortfall to investors of $614,815.14. 25. After the SEC™s investigation began, the franchisor placed Caufield and the Dallas franchise on heightened supervision.  Then, in 2018, the Dallas franchise was sold to an independent third party.  The sale of the franchise, pursuant to terms set by the franchisor, resulted in an additional distribution of $1,329,976.97 to the franchise™s student investors. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF First Claim Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act  26. The SEC re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-25 by reference as if set forth fully herein. 27. Defendant Caufield, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, in the offer or sale of securities, by use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails:  (a) employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud; and/or (b) obtained money or property by means of untrue statements of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and/or (c) engaged in transactions, practices, or courses of business which operate or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchasers. 28. With respect to violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, Caufield acted knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.  With respect to violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act, Caufield acted knowingly or recklessly.

Consequently, Caufield has violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]. Second Claim Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder  30. The SEC re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-25 by reference as if set forth fully herein. 31. Defendant Caufield, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, knowingly or recklessly:  (a) employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud; and/or (b) made untrue statements of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and/or (c) engaged in acts, practices, or courses of business which operate or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon purchasers of securities, or upon other persons. 32. Consequently, Caufield violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. Third Claim Violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act  33. The SEC re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-25 by reference as if set forth fully herein. 34. Defendant Caufield, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, knowingly or recklessly:  (a) employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud a client of prospective clients;                                                                                           Case 3:18-cv-02468-N   Document 1   Filed 09/17/18    Page 8 of 11   PageID 8 SEC v.

Caufield convinced more than 40 investors to invest over $6 million in his high-yield promissory notes by promising investors significant returns generated from the revenues of what he claimed was a profitable franchise. Caufield allegedly used a combination of false pitches and offering materials to lure investors, who included both students of the franchise and clients of DAT Capital Advisors, LLC-a former state-registered investment adviser wholly owned and operated by Caufield. According to the complaint, Caufield misled investors about the franchise's bleak financial condition, used new investor money to repay earlier investors, and falsely claimed that investors' notes were secured by assets.The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas, charges Caufield with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Caufield consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating these provisions, and from engaging in certain future activities in connection with the purchase, offer and sale of securities. The final judgment orders disgorgement of $614,815.14 plus prejudgment interest of $126,032.11, both of which will be deemed satisfied by proceeds repaid to certain investors from Caufield's 2018 sale of the franchise. Caufield also agreed to a $160,000 civil penalty and will be barred from further association with certain regulated entities.The SEC's investigation was led by Robert C. Hannan and Melvin Warren with litigation assistance from Christopher A. Davis, and supervised by Scott F. Mascianica and Eric Werner."
43,"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,    Plaintiff,   v.  KIMBERLY PINE KITTS,    Defendant.    Civil Action No. _________________    JURY TRIAL DEMANDED    COMPLAINT Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁCommissionﬂ), for its Complaint against defendant Kimberly Pine Kitts (ﬁKittsﬂ or ﬁDefendantﬂ), alleges as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. From April 2004 through November 2017, the Defendant was employed as an investment adviser representative at a dually-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser firm (ﬁFirmﬂ).  Over the course of several years she engaged in various schemes to defraud her clients.  These schemes included: (1) forging withdrawal requests and misappropriating clients™ variable annuity funds; (2) forging wire and check requests and misappropriating clients™ brokerage account funds; and (3) misleading a client to withdraw funds from a retirement account and secretly directing those funds to the Defendant™s bank account.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 209(d), 209(e), and 214 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (ﬁAdvisers Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9(d), 80b-9(e) and 80b-14] Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 1 of 8 2  and Sections 21(d)(3), 21(e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁExchange Actﬂ) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(3), 78u(e), and 78aa]. 3. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 214 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because a substantial portion of the conduct alleged in this complaint occurred within the District of Massachusetts.   4. In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendant, directly or indirectly, has made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce or the mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business alleged in this complaint. DEFENDANT 5. Kitts, age 51, is a resident of Orleans, Massachusetts.  In April 2004 she was employed by the Firm as a registered representative and investment adviser representative in one of the Firm™s branch offices in Massachusetts doing business as (ﬁd/b/aﬂ) Marquis Consulting, LLC (ﬁMarquisﬂ), an entity she created and wholly controlled. 6. In addition to operating as a d/b/a, Marquis purportedly offered tax and business valuation services, and Kitts performed tax work for several of her advisory clients through Marquis.  Kitts represented that she was a Certified Public Accountant, and even told at least two of her advisory clients that she held a Ph.D. in economics, neither of which is true.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 7. Beginning in 2011, the Defendant engaged in at least three separate schemes to misappropriate the assets of her clients in order to pay her personal expenses.  She directed these client assets to two bank accounts for Marquis, although the majority of misappropriated funds Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 2 of 8 3  were placed in one account (the ﬁMarquis Accountﬂ).  In each instance, the Defendant exploited her fiduciary relationship with an advisory client, made intentional misstatements, and engaged in deceptive conduct in order to obscure her wrongdoing.    Misappropriation of Clients™ Variable Annuity Funds  8. Some of the Defendant™s advisory clients purchased and held a type of financial product known as a variable annuity.  A variable annuity is a contract between an investor and an insurance company, under which the insurance company agrees to make periodic payments to the investor, beginning either immediately or at some future date.  From July 2011 through June 2013, the Defendant made unauthorized withdrawals from the variable annuities of six of her advisory clients (collectively, ﬁthe Annuity Clientsﬂ).  The Defendant submitted withdrawal forms to two insurance companies on which she forged her clients™ signatures and directed the funds to two of her Marquis bank accounts for her personal use.  In total, the Defendant made 24 unauthorized withdrawals of client funds totaling $962,654.   Misappropriation of Clients™ Brokerage Account Funds 9. In June 2013, the Defendant began stealing money from three of her clients™ brokerage accounts.  Client A is in her early-50s and was a client of the Defendant for seven years.  Clients B and C are a retired couple who were clients of the Defendant for 12 years.  Clients B and C were also Annuity Clients from whom the Defendant had misappropriated $481,401.85 in variable annuity funds. 10. On June 24, 2013, the Defendant forged Client A™s signature on an Outgoing Federal Fund Wire Request to the Firm with instructions to wire $75,000 from Client A™s brokerage account to the Marquis Account ﬁfor further creditﬂ to Client A.  The Defendant did Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 3 of 8 4  not ﬁcreditﬂ or use these funds for the benefit of Client A, but instead used them for her own personal purposes.      11. In an apparent attempt to avoid questions about transferring Client A™s funds to a third-party account, i.e., the Marquis Account, the Defendant submitted fake documentation to the Firm showing that Client A was the owner of a New York-based company, Marquis, LLC.  In fact, Marquis, LLC was non-existent.  Client A never formed any such company nor had any knowledge of the Defendant™s representations to the Firm. 12. After the initial $75,000 transfer of Client A™s funds, the Defendant submitted several additional wire requests forged with Client A™s signature.  By November 2013, the Defendant established a standing authorization through additional forgeries of Client A™s signature to allow her to transfer money from Client A™s account to the Marquis Account without a written request.  The Defendant transferred a total of $355,636.87 from Client A™s brokerage account to her Marquis Account in 2013.  The steady conversion of funds occurred over the next four years in the following amounts: $763,000 in 2014; $357,250 in 2015; $530,000 in 2016; and $9,000 in 2017.  In total, from 2013 to 2017 the Defendant made 56 unauthorized withdrawals, misappropriating $2,014,887 from Client A™s brokerage account. 13. After Client A™s funds were nearly depleted from Client A™s brokerage account by early 2017, the Defendant returned to stealing funds from Clients B and C.  In May 2017, the Defendant forged a written request for a $125,000 check from Clients B and C™s brokerage account payable to Marquis LLC.  The Defendant deposited this check into her Marquis Account.  Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 4 of 8 5   Misleading her Client to Withdraw Money from her Retirement Account 14. In June 2017, the Defendant advised Client B that she should move $200,000 from her individual retirement account (ﬁIRAﬂ) to the managed cash account she shared with Client C to pay some taxes.  The Defendant tricked Client B into signing signature pages for IRA distributions, while concealing the directions for delivery of funds.  Unbeknownst to Clients B and C, the Defendant directed the $200,000 distribution to her Marquis Account.    The Defendant™s Cover-Up 15. In August 2017, Client A asked the Defendant for all of her account statements, not yet suspecting any wrongdoing.  When the Defendant failed to provide her statements, Client A™s lawyer contacted the Firm.  In response, the Firm initiated an investigation.  After seeing the large number of wire transfers from Client A™s brokerage account to the Marquis Account, the Firm asked the Defendant to provide the Marquis Account monthly statements.  To hide evidence of the unauthorized withdrawals from Client A™s brokerage account, the Defendant electronically altered the Marquis Account monthly statements to change the sources and amounts of the deposits into that account.   16. In addition, the Defendant told the Firm that Marquis, LLC was created by Client A and named after the Defendant™s company because of their close friendship.  In an attempt to bolster this falsehood, the Defendant created fake Schedule C tax forms for Marquis, LLC for 2014-2016 and emailed them to the Firm.   17. By early November 2017, the Firm concluded that the Defendant misappropriated funds from Client A™s account.  The Firm terminated the Defendant on November 15, 2017.    Tolling Agreement  18. Kitts entered a tolling agreement with the Commission for the period March 1, 2018 through December 1, 2018.  This agreement tolled the running of any limitations period or Case 1:18-cv-11507   Document 1   Filed 07/19/18   Page 5 of 8 6  any other time-related defenses to any claims alleged in the Complaint for a period of nine months.

Kitts continued this practice until 2017 when a client questioned Kitts about the dwindling balance in her account. Through 82 unauthorized withdrawals, Kitts stole more than three million dollars from seven clients, and then tried to conceal her fraud through falsified account statements and other documentation. Kitts used the money she stole for personal expenses, including paying for vacations and several luxury vehicles.The Commission's complaint alleges that Kitts violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement plus prejudgment interest against Kitts.The Commission's case is being handled by Gretchen Lundgren, John McCann, and Michele T. Perillo of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Paul D'Amico, Mark Gera, and Andrew D. Caverly of the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations in the Boston office, who conducted a related examination."
