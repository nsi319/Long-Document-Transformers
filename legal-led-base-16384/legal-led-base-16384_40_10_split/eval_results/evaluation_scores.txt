Turner & Company, L.L.C., with entering fictitious sales of market-linked certificates of deposit (MLCDs) in order to avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations for the fixed income products.According to the complaint, Palermo paid above-market prices to acquire MLCDs from J.P. Turner brokerage customers, and then held the MLCDs in J.P. Turner's inventory. To avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations, Palermo entered dozens of fictitious trades over a seven-month period, beginning in August 2014. Palermo entered the sham sales in order to give the impression that the MLCDs had been sold from J.P. Turner's inventory , knowing the named counterparty never agreed to buy the MLCDs and that each trade would ultimately be cancelled. As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner kept inaccurate trade blotters, showed incorrect asset and revenue account balances, and filed inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports for each month between August 2014 and February 2015.The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Palermo aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder.

Palermo, a registered broker for J.P. Turner, L.C., knowingly entered a series of fictitious sales orders that resulted in the loss of approximately $3.44 million from the firm's fixed-income inventory. According to the complaint, between August 2014 and March 2015, over a third of his customers sought to sell certain MLCDs, including Citibank and United Community Bank, which were used as collateral for their investments. In some cases, this was done without authorization by the broker, and the transaction was terminated without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. The SEC further alleges in its complaint that Paleri assisted and abetted these fraudulent sales by using his position as a broker to conceal the existence of a named counterparty/purchaser who failed to make accurate trade orders for certain instruments, such as those used in a trading scheme, to obtain client orders and to maintain a position in one or more of these instruments for a period of several months before being permanently enjoined from future trading activities and permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any trading company.According to court documents obtained from this investigation, in addition to these violations, Paliermo also engaged in other fraudulent transactions that occurred during the same time period. Among other things, he assisted a number of other companies in obtaining and selling fixed asset trading instruments.
