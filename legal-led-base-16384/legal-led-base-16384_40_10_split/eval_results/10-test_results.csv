The complaint also alleged that in some instances, when the price of a stock went up or down during the Trade Day, he would wait for the stock to go down and then allocate the trades to one or more accounts held by his other customers. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, in addition to the monetary penalty, there was also a penalty for violating these provisions, as well as the civil injunctions, which prohibit the commission of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest of $700,000.According to court documents, between 2012 and February 2017, over 60 percent of customers who purchased stock using the Allocation Account used the account to make trades that were not for themselves or their customers, or to be used as a trading tool in a future trade.

Palermo, a registered broker for J.P. Turner, L.C., knowingly entered a series of fictitious sales orders that resulted in the loss of approximately $3.44 million from the firm's fixed-income inventory. According to the complaint, between August 2014 and March 2015, over a third of his customers sought to sell certain MLCDs, including Citibank and United Community Bank, which were used as collateral for their investments. In some cases, this was done without authorization by the broker, and the transaction was terminated without admitting or denying the Commission's findings. The SEC further alleges in its complaint that Paleri assisted and abetted these fraudulent sales by using his position as a broker to conceal the existence of a named counterparty/purchaser who failed to make accurate trade orders for certain instruments, such as those used in a trading scheme, to obtain client orders and to maintain a position in one or more of these instruments for a period of several months before being permanently enjoined from future trading activities and permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any trading company.According to court documents obtained from this investigation, in addition to these violations, Paliermo also engaged in other fraudulent transactions that occurred during the same time period.

Palermo, a trader formerly employed by J.P. Turner & Company, L.L.C., with entering fictitious sales of market-linked certificates of deposit (MLCDs) in order to avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations for the fixed income products.According to the complaint, Palermo paid above-market prices to acquire MLCDs from J.P. Turner brokerage customers, and then held the MLCDs in J.P. Turner's inventory. To avoid J.P. Turner's inventory limitations, Palermo entered dozens of fictitious trades over a seven-month period, beginning in August 2014. Palermo entered the sham sales in order to give the impression that the MLCDs had been sold from J.P. Turner's inventory , knowing the named counterparty never agreed to buy the MLCDs and that each trade would ultimately be cancelled. As a result of these sham transactions, J.P. Turner kept inaccurate trade blotters, showed incorrect asset and revenue account balances, and filed inaccurate Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports for each month between August 2014 and February 2015.The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Palermo aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder.

Taylor and his company, Temenos Advisory, Inc., engaged in the same practice from 2014 to 2017, steering clients into unsuitable investments that they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, were not suitable or appropriate for their clients.According to the SEC, in 2014 and 2015, the two companies solicited client investments in companies that had poor financial condition, questionable spending practices, misstatements and omissions in marketing materials, and misappropriated millions of dollars of client funds. The SEC further alleged that in 2015 and 2016, respectively, they steered more than 20,000 client placements into unapproved investments, resulting in over $11.2 million in losses for the clients, who included retail investors, pension funds and individuals looking to invest their retirement money. According to court documents, during that period, Taylor allegedly used his position as an investment adviser to solicit clients' investment decisions. In addition, he allegedly promoted the investments as being suitable for his client's needs.In addition to violating the fiduciary duty of the Securities Act of 1933, Temenos and Taylor also violated the U.S. Securities Exchange Act's antifraud provisions, as well as Section 10(b) of The Securities Industry Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 13(a) therewith. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Defendants have agreed to permanently enjoin the entry of a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, plus a penalty of up to $1,200, which will be served by a court-appointed monitor.","The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Connecticut investment advisory firm and its chief executive officer with putting $19 million of investor money, including elderly investors' retirement savings and pension plans, in risky investments and secretly pocketing hefty commissions from those investments.The SEC's complaint alleges that Temenos Advisory, Inc. and George L.
