Actual Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a 35-year-old Kentucky man for his role in a scheme that resulted in the fraudulent offering and sale of at least $15 million of securities to more than 150 investors.The SEC's complaint alleges that Jared Gabriel Forrester was installed as a figurehead to run Tennessee-based Tennstar Energy Group, Inc., formerly known as Black Gold Resources, Inc. He misled investors by failing to disclose that two convicted felons actually were running the company. Despite having no background in oil drilling or production efforts, Tennstar's website allegedly described Forrester as having "an immense knowledgebase in oil and gas development and how to effectively maximize profits." Tennstar offering materials also allegedly claimed that Forrester "had a multitude of roles within the petroleum industry over the years." The complaint further alleges that Forrester even told one Tennstar investor that he had "worked his way up through the oil fields" and had been in the industry during his "whole adult life." However, Forrester's work history mainly consisted of jobs in hotels and retail furniture sales, as well as a stint as a stock broker trainee.Last year, the SEC charged David Greenlee and David Stewart, the two ringleaders behind the oil investment scheme for raising millions from investors, telling participants that the funds would be used to acquire interests in well leases and to recover oil from the wells. Instead, they steered most of the money into advertising, sales commissions, or misappropriated the money for personal use. In addition to misstatements about his own experience, Forrester assisted Greenlee and Stewart with the overall operation of the fraudulent scheme. For example, he incorporated the company at their request, made improper payments to Tennstar sales teams, and sent investor funds to bank accounts controlled by Greenlee and Stewart.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Forrester consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement plus interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian M. Basinger, Stephen E. Donahue, and Edward G. Sullivan of the Atlanta office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the U.S. Secret Service.

Actual Summary: 
The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Mark Suleymanov of Glen Cove, New York with engaging in an online binary options scheme that defrauded retail investors out of approximately $4 million.The SEC's complaint alleges that from at least 2012 to 2016, Suleymanov engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of binary options, which are securities that pay out depending on the outcome of a "yes/no" proposition, such as whether a specific equity security will close at or above a specified price on a given trading day. Suleymanov promoted and sold the options on the SpotFN website and other related websites he controlled, and misrepresented the profitability of investing in the binary options, as well as investors' ability to access their funds. Suleymanov allegedly used software to manipulate investors' trading results to increase investor losses, and prevented many investors from withdrawing their funds. As alleged in the complaint, the SpotFN website also falsely stated that an investor's funds would be held in a separate account and used only for trading options, not for SpotFN's business expenses. In fact, Suleymanov commingled investor funds in his bank accounts and misused certain of the funds for business and personal expenses.The SEC's complaint charges Suleymanov with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty. Suleymanov has agreed to a bifurcated settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from these provisions. The settlement, which is subject to Court approval, reserves the issues of disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil penalty for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Shioji and supervised by Lisa Deitch, Cheryl Crumpton, and Antonia Chion. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office.To learn more about binary options fraud, see the binary options fraud webpage on Investor.gov.
